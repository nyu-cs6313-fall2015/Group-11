        Centers International (commonly referred to as ``OICI'') and the

Whereas the Reverend Dr. Sullivan made a substantial impact on the lives of the 
        people in Africa through the actions of OICI and IFESH;
Whereas the Reverend Dr. Sullivan founded the Progress Investment Associates

        ventures for inner-city dwellers;
Whereas the Reverend Dr. Sullivan established inner-city retirement and assisted 
        living complexes for the elderly and disabled in Philadelphia and other 
        cities throughout the United States, named Opportunities Towers;
Whereas the Reverend Dr. Sullivan was able, as the first African-American member 
        on the board of General Motors Corporation, to secure the support of the 
        other board members to back him in the development of the unprecedented 
        Global Sullivan Principles, a code of conduct written in 1977, for 
        United States businesses operating in South Africa;
Whereas the Reverend Dr. Sullivan has been the recipient of the Presidential

        to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.
