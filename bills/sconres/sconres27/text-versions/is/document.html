 Expressing the sense of Congress that the United States should ensure 
   that Israel is able to adequately address an existential Iranian 
    nuclear threat and to support Israel's right to respond to the 
         potential threat of a Syrian S-300 air defense system.

    This resolution may be cited as the ``Support of Israel Against 
Existential Threat Resolution of 2013''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SUPPORT TO ISRAEL TO ADDRESS IRANIAN AND 
              SYRIAN THREATS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should ensure that Israel, as a 
        critical United States ally, is able to adequately address an 
        existential Iranian nuclear threat, and the Secretary of 
        Defense should seek related opportunities for defense 
        cooperation and partnership on military capabilities where 
        appropriate; and
            (2) the delivery of the S-300 air defense system to Syria 
        would pose a grave risk to Israel, and the United States 
        supports Israel's right to respond to this grave threat as 
        needed.
