  <summary>12/11/2014--Reported to Senate amended.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. government should: (1) use all lawful tools to bring Warren Weinstein home to his family; (2) make the return of all U.S. citizens held captive abroad a top priority; and (3) keep Congress apprised of its actions to achieve such goals as new information is available, or quarterly if no new information is available.

States that nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an authorization for the use of military force.</summary>
