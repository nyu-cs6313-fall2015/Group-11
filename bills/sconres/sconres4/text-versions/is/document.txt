 Coburn, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts,

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax is not in the 
                economic interest of the United States.

Whereas a carbon tax is regressive in nature and would unfairly burden those 
        vulnerable individuals and families in the United States that are 
        already struggling under a stagnating economy;
Whereas a carbon tax would increase the cost of every good manufactured in the 
        United States;
Whereas a carbon tax would harm the entire United States manufacturing sector;
Whereas the increase in production of domestic energy resources on private and 
        State-owned land has created significant job growth and private capital 
        investment; and
Whereas affordable and reliable energy sources are critical to maintaining the 
        United States global competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental 
to American families and businesses, and is not in the interest of the 
United States.
