                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            January 28, 2013

 Mr. Vitter (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Lee, Mr. Moran, 
Mr. McConnell, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. 
 Coburn, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, 
    Mr. Heller, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Johanns) submitted the following 
 concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress that a carbon tax is not in the 
                economic interest of the United States.

Whereas a carbon tax is regressive in nature and would unfairly burden those 
        vulnerable individuals and families in the United States that are 
        already struggling under a stagnating economy;
Whereas a carbon tax would increase the cost of every good manufactured in the 
        United States;
Whereas a carbon tax would harm the entire United States manufacturing sector;
Whereas the increase in production of domestic energy resources on private and 
        State-owned land has created significant job growth and private capital 
        investment; and
Whereas affordable and reliable energy sources are critical to maintaining the 
        United States global competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that a carbon tax would be detrimental 
to American families and businesses, and is not in the interest of the 
United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
