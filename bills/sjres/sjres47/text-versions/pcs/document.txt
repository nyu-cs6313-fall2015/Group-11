                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
To authorize the limited use of the United States Armed Forces against 
               the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Whereas the terrorist organization known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the 
        Levant and various other names (in this resolution referred to as 
        ``ISIL'') poses a grave threat to the people and territorial integrity 
        of Iraq, Syria, regional stability, and the national security interests 
        of the United States and its allies and partners;
Whereas ISIL holds significant territory in Iraq and Syria and has stated its 
        intention to seize more territory and demonstrated the capability to do 
        so;
Whereas ISIL leaders have stated that they intend to conduct terrorist attacks 
        internationally, including against the United States, its citizens, and 
        interests;
Whereas ISIL has committed despicable acts of violence and mass executions 
        against Muslims, regardless of sect, who do not subscribe to ISIL's 
        depraved, violent, and oppressive ideology;
Whereas ISIL has threatened genocide and committed vicious acts of violence 
        against religious and ethnic minority groups, including Iraqi 
        Christians, Yezidi, and Turkmen populations;
Whereas ISIL has targeted innocent women and girls with horrific acts of 
        violence, including abduction, enslavement, torture, rape, and forced 
        marriage;
Whereas ISIL is responsible for the brutal murder of innocent United States 
        citizens, including James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and Abdul-Rahman Peter 
        Kassig;
Whereas it is the policy of the United States to work with regional and global 
        allies and partners to degrade and defeat ISIL, to cut off its funding, 
        to stop the flow of foreign fighters to its ranks, and to support local 
        communities as they reject ISIL;
Whereas the announcement of the anti-ISIL Coalition on September 5, 2014, during 
        the NATO Summit in Wales, stated that ISIL poses a serious threat and 
        should be countered by a broad international coalition;
Whereas President Barack Obama articulated five lines of effort in the campaign 
        to counter ISIL, including supporting regional military partners, 
        stopping the flow of foreign fighters, cutting off ISIL's access to 
        financing, addressing urgent humanitarian needs, and contesting ISIL's 
        messaging;
Whereas the United States Government calls on its allies and partners in the 
        Middle East and North Africa that have not already done so to join and 
        participate in the anti-ISIL Coalition;
Whereas the United States Government has successfully conducted airstrikes in 
        Iraq, in coordination with Iraqi and Kurdish security forces, to prevent 
        humanitarian catastrophes, protect vulnerable minority populations, 
        repel ISIL from areas of strategic importance, and demonstrate support 
        to communities in western and northern Iraq being terrorized by ISIL;
Whereas the United States Government has successfully conducted airstrikes in 
        Syria, in coordination with local actors on the ground who demonstrate 
        commitment and capability in countering ISIL, in order to target ISIL 
        training camps and munitions facilities, stop sources of ISIL funding, 
        protect vulnerable minority populations, and target extremist groups 
        intent on attacking the United States and its allies;
Whereas United States and Coalition airstrikes to date have succeeded in halting 
        ISIL's advance in Iraq and Syria;
Whereas the President should to the greatest extent possible act in concert or 
        cooperation with the security forces of other countries in the region to 
        counter the grave threat to regional stability and international 
        security posed by ISIL;
Whereas the anti-ISIL strategy requires effective local security forces in Iraq 
        and Syria, and empowered political leaders committed to leading 
        inclusive, representative governments that enable citizens in both 
        countries to achieve their legitimate aspirations and to live in peace 
        and security; and
Whereas President Obama stated on November 5, 2014, his commitment to working 
        with Congress to pass an authorization for the use of military force for 
        the anti-ISIL military campaign: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That
