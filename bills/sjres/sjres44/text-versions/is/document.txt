                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against the Islamic 
                     State in Iraq and the Levant.

Whereas that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), also known as ISIS 
        or the Islamic State, is a terrorist organization committing daily acts 
        of barbarity currently encompassing large portions of Syria and Iraq, 
        and is a serious threat to the United States and the international 
        community;
Whereas ISIL's violence is destructive of religious freedom, the equality of 
        women, protections against genocide, principles of national sovereignty, 
        freedom of expression, and other core human rights protected by 
        international law;
Whereas ISIL's grisly execution of United States hostages, recruitment of United 
        States citizens and others to serve as foreign fighters that threaten to 
        return to the United States and other nations, and pledges to carry out 
        additional acts of violence directly against the United States make it a 
        threat of growing significance to the United States; and
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolutions 2169 (2014) and 2170 (2014) 
        note that ISIL's advancement is a major threat to Iraq's future, condemn 
        attacks by ISIL, reiterate international community support for Iraq's 
        security and territorial integrity, and emphasize the need for the 
        international community to work together to help stabilize Iraq and 
        combat ISIL: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization for Use 
of Military Force against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant''.

        of the United States Armed Forces or United States citizens 
        from imminent danger posed by ISIL, or for limited operations 
        against high value targets; or
            (2) authorization for the use of force against forces 
        associated with ISIL, unless such forces are identified in a

        cooperation with, the national government of Syria that was in 
        power as of the date of the enactment of this resolution, or 
        its security services; or
