                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 8, 2014

 Mr. Inhofe introduced the following joint resolution; which was read 
        twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations

                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
   To authorize the use of force against the organization called the 
  Islamic State in order to defend the American people and assist the 
 Iraqi Government in expelling the Islamic State from their territory.

Whereas the organization called the Islamic State or ``IS'', formerly known as 
        the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, has murdered United States 
        citizens;
Whereas IS has threatened to kill United States citizens and the current leader 
        of IS has stated that ``[t]he war with you has just begun'';
Whereas the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of United 
        Kingdom have jointly confirmed the threat posed by IS fighters returning 
        to allied nations and American shores by stating that ``[w]hether it is 
        regional aggression going unchecked or the prospect that foreign 
        fighters could return from Iraq and Syria to pose a threat in our 
        countries, the problems we face today threaten the security of the 
        British and American people, and the wider world'';
Whereas Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel has stated IS is ``as sophisticated and 
        well-funded as any group that we have seen. . . .'' and ``. . . an 
        imminent threat to every interest we have, whether it's in Iraq or 
        anywhere else. . . .'';
Whereas acts, such as the murder of United States citizens, and threats of other 
        terrorist acts render it both necessary and appropriate that the United 
        States exercise its rights to self-defense and to protect United States 
        citizens both home and abroad;
Whereas acts, such as the murder of United States citizens, and threats of other 
        terrorist acts continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to 
        the national security and foreign policy of the United States;
Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution (``UNSCR'') 2169 notes the 
        Islamic State's advancement is a major threat to Iraq's future, condemns 
        the attacks by the Islamic State, reiterates the international community 
        support for Iraq's security and territorial integrity, and emphasizes 
        ``the need to continue efforts to promote international and regional 
        cooperation aimed at supporting Iraq to prevent terrorist groups . . . 
        in particular ISIL [IS], from using the territories of Iraq and 
        neighboring States to carry out violence or other illicit acts to 
        destabilize Iraq and the region . . .'';
Whereas UNSCR 2169 further notes IS's actions have resulted in ``heavy human 
        causalities including children, the displacement of more than one 
        million Iraqi civilians and the threats against all religious and ethnic 
        groups . . .''; and
Whereas the Iraqi Government has requested the assistance of the United States: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,
