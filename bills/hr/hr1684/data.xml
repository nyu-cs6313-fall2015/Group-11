  <summary>1/27/2014--Passed House without amendment.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.)

Ranch A Consolidation and Management Improvement Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), acting through the Forest Service, to convey to Wyoming, upon state request, without consideration and by quitclaim deed, all interest of the United States in approximately 10 acres of National Forest System land located in the Black Hills National Forest in Crook County, Wyoming.

Repeals the requirement that Ranch A be used for: (1) fish and wildlife management and educational activities; and (2) maintenance and restoration of the museum-quality real and personal property there. Repeals as well the reversionary interest of the United States in the property if the state of Wyoming uses it for any other purpose or develops the property.</summary>
