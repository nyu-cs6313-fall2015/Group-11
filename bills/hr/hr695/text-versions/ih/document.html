    (d) Introduction.--After a House of Congress receives the 
President's transmission of approved recommendations pursuant to 
section 13, the majority leader of that House (or a designee) shall

subsection (c)--
            (1) in the case of the House of Representatives, within

        Representatives to which a joint resolution is referred shall 
        report it to the House without amendment not later than the

        ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening 
        motion except twenty minutes of debate equally divided and

        day on which the proponent announces his intention to offer the 
        motion. Notice may not be given on an anticipatory basis. Such 
        a motion shall not be in order after the House has disposed of 
        a motion to proceed with respect to that transmittal of 
        recommendations. The previous question shall be considered as 
        ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening

        disposed of shall not be in order.

        joint resolution of that House described in subsection (c), 
        that House received from the other House a joint resolution 
        described in subsection (c), then the following procedures 
        shall apply:

                subparagraph (B).
                    (B) Joint resolution procedure.--With respect to a

                House receiving the joint resolution the procedure in 
                that House shall be the same as if no joint resolution 
                had been received from the other House, but the vote on 
                final passage shall be on the joint resolution of the 
                other House.
            (2) No consideration.--Upon disposition of the joint 
        resolution received from the other House, it shall no longer be

Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of a joint resolution described in this 
        section, and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that 
        it is inconsistent with such rules; and
