    (a) In General.--Section 502(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C.

            ``(3) Vietnam.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In addition to the countries 
                listed in paragraph (1), Vietnam may not be designated 
                as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of 
                this title unless the President submits to Congress a 
                certification described in subparagraph (B).
                    ``(B) Certification.--A certification referred to 
                in subparagraph (A) is a certification that contains a 
                determination of the President that--
                            ``(i) Vietnam is not on the special watch 
                        list under section 110(b)(3)(A) of the 
                        Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22

                        internationally recognized human rights, 
                        including freedom of speech and freedom of 
                        religion; and
                            ``(iii) Vietnam otherwise meets the 
                        requirements of this title.
                    ``(C) Waiver.--The President may waive the 
                application of subparagraph (A) if the President 
                determines and certifies to Congress that it is in the 
                national interest of the United States to do so.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section applies to
