 To provide for medical neutrality and to establish accountability for 
   violations of the principle of medical neutrality, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Neutrality Protection Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) International humanitarian law codifies the principle 
        of medical neutrality in the Geneva Conventions, to which the 
        United States is a signatory, during times of national or 
        international armed conflict, which offer special protections 
        to medical facilities and personnel. These provisions recognize 
        ambulances, hospitals, hospital ships, the personnel serving in 
        ambulances and hospitals, citizens who assist the wounded as 
        neutral and protected during conflict.
            (2) The Geneva Conventions specify that the wounded and 
        sick shall receive adequate care, be protected from ill-
        treatment, and be protected from discrimination, and that 
        emblems such as the red cross and red crescent are recognized 
        as protective emblems in conflict. Many parts of the Geneva 
        Conventions have been declared by the International Committee 
        on the Red Cross (ICRC) to be customary international 
        humanitarian law.
    (b) Statement of Congress.--Congress affirms its support of 
participants of peaceful demonstrations around the world, as part of 
the United States support for freedom of assembly as enshrined in the 
United States Constitution. The United States takes particular umbrage 
at countries that harm or endanger medical professionals during times 
of unrest.

                Representatives; and
