  <summary>11/20/2014--Introduced.
Drinking Water Protection Act - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and submit to Congress a strategic plan for assessing and managing risks associated with cyanotoxins in drinking water provided by public water systems. (Cyanotoxins are naturally occurring toxins produced by cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae.)

Requires the plan to include steps and time lines to:

 evaluate the risk to human health from drinking water contaminated with cyanotoxins; establish, publish, and update a comprehensive list of cyanotoxins that are harmful to human health; summarize the known adverse human health effects of cyanotoxins and the factors that cause cyanobacteria to grow rapidly and make toxins; determine whether to publish health advisories for harmful cyanotoxins and establish relevant guidance; recommend feasible treatment options; and enter into cooperative agreements with, and provide technical assistance to, affected states and public water systems to manage risks associated with cyanotoxins.</summary>
