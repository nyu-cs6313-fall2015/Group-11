                       OF NAVAL VESSELS TO TAIWAN

SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF POLICY RELATING TO TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Taiwan Relations Act has been instrumental in 
        maintaining peace, security, and stability in the Western 
        Pacific since its enactment in 1979, and it is in the 
        political, security, and economic interests of the United 
        States.
            (2) The Taiwan Relations Act affirmed that the United 
        States' decision to establish a diplomatic relationship with 
        the People's Republic of China was based on the expectation 
        that the future of Taiwan would be determined by peaceful 
        means.
            (3) The Taiwan Relations Act also states that ``it is the 
        policy of the United States to provide Taiwan with arms of a 
        defensive character and to maintain the capacity of the United 
        States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion 
        that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic 
        system, of the people on Taiwan''.
            (4) The Taiwan Relations Act also states that ``it is the 
        policy of the United States to preserve and promote extensive, 
        close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations 
        between the people of the United States and the people on 
        Taiwan, as well as the people on the China mainland and all 
        other peoples of the Western Pacific area''.
            (5) The relationship between the United States and Taiwan 
        has been strengthened with--
                    (A) Taiwan's evolution into a free society and a 
                full-fledged, multi-party democracy;
                    (B) the development of Taiwan's robust market 
                economy;
                    (C) Taiwan's collaboration with the United States 
                to combat terrorism, as demonstrated in part by its 
                participation in the Container Security Initiative; and
                    (D) the role Taiwan has played in addressing 
                transnational and global challenges, including its 
                active engagement in humanitarian relief measures, 
                public health endeavors, environmental protection 
                initiatives, and financial market stabilization 
                efforts.
            (6) The United States is the third largest trading partner 
        and the largest investor in Taiwan, while Taiwan is the twelfth 
        largest trading partner of the United States and the eighth 
        largest United States agricultural market.
            (7) Taiwan's democracy has deepened with the second 
        peaceful transfer of power from one political party to another 
        after the presidential election in March 2008.
            (8) The United States and Taiwan are united in our shared 
        values in free elections, personal liberty, and free 
        enterprise.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--Congress--
            (1) reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the Taiwan 
        Relations Act as the cornerstone of relations between the 
        United States and Taiwan;
            (2) reaffirms its support for Taiwan's democratic 
        institutions;
            (3) reaffirms that peace in the Taiwan Strait should be 
        maintained to the benefit of the Asia-Pacific region;
            (4) supports the United States commitment to Taiwan's 
        security in accord with the Taiwan Relations Act, including 
        Taiwan's procurement of sophisticated weapons of a defensive 
        character, such as F-16 C/Ds aircraft and diesel electric 
        submarines;
            (5) reaffirms its commitment to deepen United States-Taiwan 
        trade and investment relations as well as support for Taiwan's 
        inclusion in bilateral and regional trade agreements at the 
        appropriate time and under the right conditions in which 
        outstanding issues affecting United States exports are being 
        addressed; and
            (6) supports the strong and deepening relationship between 
        the United States and Taiwan.

OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class guided missile frigates USS TAYLOR (FFG-50),

including a United States Navy shipyard.

under this section shall expire at the end of the 3-year period 
beginning on the date of the enactment of this section.

TITLE II--TRANSFER OF NAVAL VESSELS TO CERTAIN OTHER FOREIGN RECIPIENTS

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    (a) Relating to Mexico.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The partnership between the United States and Mexico 
        helps the economic and national security of both countries, 
        including in the area of energy.
            (2) The United States and Mexico share a common goal of 
        reducing the flow of narcotics and the influence of 
        transnational gangs in the Hemisphere.
            (3) The partnership between the United States and Mexico 
        helps the economic competitiveness and national security of 
        both countries.
            (4) The economies of the United States and Mexico are 
        increasingly interdependent, with bilateral foreign direct 
        investment increasing more than six-fold over the past two 
        decades.
            (5) In 2012 alone, bilateral trade in goods and services 
        between the United States and Mexico exceeded $500,000,000,000.
            (6) The transfer of naval vessels to Mexico authorized 
        under section 202 supports the modernization efforts of the 
        Mexican Navy.
            (7) Such naval vessels are suitable to support Mexico's 
        offshore maritime surveillance, counter trafficking, 
        interdiction, and oil platform security.
            (8) The transfer of such naval vessels will contribute to 
        United States interests in promoting increased maritime 
        awareness to support security and protection of the people of 
        the United States and the people of Mexico.
    (b) Relating to Thailand.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Thailand was the first treaty ally of the United States 
        in the Asia-Pacific region and remains a steadfast friend of 
        the United States.
            (2) In December 2003, the United States designated Thailand 
        as a major non-NATO ally, which improved the security of both 
        countries, particularly by facilitating joint counterterrorism 
        efforts.
            (3) For more than 30 years, Thailand has been the host 
        country of Cobra Gold, the United States Pacific Command's 
        annual multinational military training exercise, which is 
        designed to ensure regional peace and promote regional security 
        cooperation.
            (4) The Royal Thai Navy has commanded Combined Task Force 
        151 (CTF 151) of the Combined Maritime Forces, a multi-national 
        naval partnership consisting of 30 nations operating in and 
        around the Gulf of Aden and off the eastern coast of Somalia.
            (5) With the assistance of the Royal Thai Navy's Counter 
        Piracy Task Group, CTF 151 is helping to expressly disrupt and 
        suppress piracy, protect all vessels in the region and secure 
        their free navigation.
            (6) The Royal Thai Navy is also participating in the 
        multilateral Malacca Straits patrols with other regional 
        partners to promote maritime safety and security.
            (7) The transfer of naval vessels to Thailand authorized 
        under section 202 will support enhanced interoperability 
        between the Royal Thai Navy and United States Navy forces.
            (8) The transfer of such naval vessels underscores the 
        United States commitment to United States-Thai relations and to 
        peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region.

articles transferred in any fiscal year under section 516 of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321j).
