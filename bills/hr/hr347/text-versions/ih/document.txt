                                 A BILL


 
  To provide, develop, and support 21st century readiness initiatives 
    that assist students in acquiring the skills necessary to think 
     critically and solve problems, be an effective communicator, 
       collaborate with others, and learn to create and innovate.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Readiness Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Students must be prepared in core academic subjects.
            (2) Students must possess the skills to be able to think 
        critically and solve problems, be effective communicators, 
        collaborate with others, and learn to create and innovate.
            (3) In order for students in the United States to be 
        prepared to succeed in citizenship and workplaces of the 
        present and future, core academic subjects must be fused with 
        critical thinking and problem solving, communication, 
        collaboration, and creativity and innovation skills, as such 
        skills are critical for success in the 21st century.
            (4) The work of the National Governors Association, along 
        with the Council of Chief State School Officers, in developing 
        a set of voluntary and internationally benchmarked national 
        common standards in mathematics and English that include 
        rigorous content and 21st century skills, is a positive 
        development and should serve as a basis for incorporating those 
        skills and other critical skills throughout other core academic 
        subjects in the future. Federal policy must support State 
        leadership and encourage continued State innovation.
