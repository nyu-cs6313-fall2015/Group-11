&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. SUMMARY PAGE FOR FORM 10-K.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission shall issue regulations to permit issuers to submit a 
summary page on form 10-K (17 C.F.R. 249.310), but only if each item on

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF REGULATION S-K.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission shall revise regulation S-K (17 C.F.R. 229.10 et seq.)--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) to further scale or eliminate requirements of 
        regulation S-K, in order to reduce the burden on emerging 
        growth companies, accelerated filers, and smaller reporting 
        companies, and other smaller issuers; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to eliminate provisions of regulation S-K, 
        required for all issuers, that are duplicative, overlapping, 
        outdated, or unnecessary.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 4. STUDY ON MODERNIZATION AND SIMPLIFICATION OF 
              REGULATION S-K.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) determine how best to modernize and simplify 
        such requirements in a manner that reduces the costs and 
        burdens on issuers while still providing all material 
        information;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) emphasize a company by company approach that 
        allows relevant and material information to be disseminated to 
        investors without boilerplate language or static requirements 
        while preserving completeness and comparability of information 
        across registrants; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) evaluate methods of information delivery and 
        presentation and explore methods for discouraging repetition 
        and the disclosure of immaterial information.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Report.--Not later than the end of the 360-day period 
beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall 
issue a report to the Congress containing--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) all findings and determinations made in 
        carrying out the study required under subsection (a);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) specific and detailed recommendations on 
        modernizing and simplifying the requirements in regulation S-K 
        in a manner that reduces the costs and burdens on companies 
        while still providing all material information; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) specific and detailed recommendations on ways 
        to improve the readability and navigability of disclosure 
        documents and to discourage repetition and the disclosure of 
        immaterial information.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Rulemaking.--Not later than the end of the 360-day 
period beginning on the date that the report is issued to the Congress 
under subsection (b), the Commission shall issue a proposed rule to 
implement the recommendations of the report issued under subsection 
(b).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Rule of Construction.--Revisions made to regulation S-
K by the Commission under section 3 shall not be construed as 
satisfying the rulemaking requirements under this section.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Disclosure Modernization and 
Simplification Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. SUMMARY PAGE FOR FORM 10-K.

    Not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
shall issue regulations to permit issuers to submit a summary page on

the material contained in form 10-K to which such item relates.

SEC. 3. IMPROVEMENT OF REGULATION S-K.

    Not later than the end of the 180-day period beginning on the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
shall take all such actions to revise regulation S-K (17 C.F.R. 229.10 
et seq.)--
            (1) to further scale or eliminate requirements of 
        regulation S-K, in order to reduce the burden on emerging 
        growth companies, accelerated filers, smaller reporting 
        companies, and other smaller issuers, while still providing all 
        material information to investors;
            (2) to eliminate provisions of regulation S-K, required for 
        all issuers, that are duplicative, overlapping, outdated, or 
        unnecessary; and
            (3) for which the Commission determines that no further 
        study under section 4 is necessary to determine the efficacy of

        across registrants; and
