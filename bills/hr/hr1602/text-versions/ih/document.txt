            ``(3) Production attributable to the taxpayer.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In the case of a facility in 
                which more than 1 person has an ownership interest, 
                except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed 
                by the Secretary, production from the facility shall be 
                allocated among such persons in proportion to their 
                respective ownership interests in the gross sales from 
                such facility.
                    ``(B) Special rule for indian tribes.--
                            ``(i) In general.--In the case of a 
                        facility described in subparagraph (A) in which 
                        an Indian tribe has an ownership interest in 
                        the gross sales from such facility, such Indian 
                        tribe may assign to any other person who has 
                        such an ownership interest in such facility any 
                        portion of the production from the facility 
                        that would (but for this subparagraph) be 
                        allocated to such Indian tribe. Any such 
                        assignment may be revoked only with the consent 
                        of the Secretary and shall be made at such time 
                        and in such manner as the Secretary may 
                        provide.
                            ``(ii) Indian tribe.--For purposes of 
                        clause (i), the term `Indian tribe' means any 
                        Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, or other

                        programs and services provided by the United 
                        States to Indians because of their status as 
                        Indians.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to electricity produced and sold after the date of the enactment of
