                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 38, United States Code, to amend the definition of the 
term ``spouse'' to recognize new State definitions of such term for the 
 purpose of the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran Spouses Equal Treatment 
Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF SPOUSE FOR PURPOSES OF VETERAN BENEFITS TO 
              REFLECT NEW STATE DEFINITIONS OF SPOUSE.

    Section 101 of title 38, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``of the opposite sex''; 
        and
            (2) by striking paragraph (31) and inserting the following 
        new paragraph:
            ``(31) Notwithstanding section 7 of title 1, an individual 
        shall be considered a `spouse' if the marriage of the 
        individual is valid in the State in which the marriage was 
        entered into or, in the case of a marriage entered into outside 
        any State, if the marriage is valid in the place in which the 
        marriage was entered into and the marriage could have been 
        entered into in a State. In this paragraph, the term `State' 
        has the meaning given that term in paragraph (20), except that 
        the term also includes the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
        Islands.''.
