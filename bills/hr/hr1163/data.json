(Current law requires only periodic testing and evaluation.)\n\nDefines \"information system\" as a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information. Includes in such definition: (1) computers and computer networks; (2) ancillary equipment; (3) software, firmware, and related procedures; (4) support services; and (5) related resources and services.\n\nDirects agencies to determine information security levels in accordance with information security classifications and standards promulgated under the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act.\n\nDirects agencies to collaborate with OMB and appropriate public and private sector security operations centers on security incidents that extend beyond the control of an agency. Requires that security incidents be reported, through an automated and continuous monitoring capability, when possible, to the federal information security incident center (the incident center), appropriate security operations centers, and agency Inspector General.\n\nDirects agencies to conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration tests commensurate with the risk posed to agency information systems.\n\nRequires each agency to delegate to its Chief Information Officer the authority and primary responsibility for developing, implementing, and overseeing an agencywide information security (AIS) program.\n\nDirects agencies to implement an OMB-approved AIS program that is consistent with components across and within agencies. Requires that such program include automated and continuous monitoring, when possible, to: (1) mitigate risks associated with security incidents before substantial damage is done; and (2) notify and consult with the incident center, appropriate security operations response centers, law enforcement agencies, Inspectors General, and other entities or as directed by the President.\n\nDirects the OMB Director to review and approve information security policies and procedures to ensure that the incident center has the capability to detect, correlate, and respond to incidents that impair the security of multiple agencies' information systems. Requires the capability, where practicable, to be continuous and technically automated.\n\n(Sec. 4) Specifies that no additional funds are authorized for agencies to carry out their responsibilities under this Act. Requires agencies to carry out such responsibilities using amounts otherwise authorized or appropriated."
