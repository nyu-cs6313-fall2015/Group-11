                                 A BILL


 
 To cancel the 251A sequester for the revised security category and to 
 provide for a reduced spending plan with respect to the Department of 
                    Defense, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Smarter Than Sequester Defense 
Spending Reduction Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDING.

    Congress can keep the faith with those who have sacrificed for our 
Nation, avoid cuts that harm our strategic posture, and still achieve 
spending reduction by implementing targeted reforms instead of allowing 
haphazard spending cuts to happen through sequestration.

SEC. 3. CANCELLATION OF 251A SEQUESTER AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REDUCED 
              SPENDING PLAN FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

    Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985 is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(12) Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, an 
        order by the President to carry out a sequestration under 
        paragraphs (7) or (8) with respect to the revised security 
        category shall have no force or effect.
            ``(13) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
        Department of Defense shall formulate and implement a plan to 
        reduce spending over the 10-year period beginning on the date

        in spending--

                    ``(B) of not less than $53,000,000,000 by replacing

                with 62,000 local civilian contractors instead, and 
                reducing end strengths to reflect such replacement;
                    ``(C) of not less than $52,500,000,000 by

                activities which do not contribute significantly to 
                military capability.''.
