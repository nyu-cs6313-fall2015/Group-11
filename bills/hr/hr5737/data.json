Requires such a certification to also ensure amendments to ICANN bylaws concerning: (1) advice from the Governmental Advisory Committee; (2) a required supermajority of the board of directors for votes regarding changes to bylaws or fees; and (3) terms of office and removal procedures for ICANN's directors, president, secretary, and chief financial officer.\n\nRequires the Assistant Secretary, if such a certification is not submitted to Congress by a specified deadline, to: (1) extend the existing contract between the NTIA and ICANN if an option exists to extend the contract during the base period of performance ending on September 30, 2015, or during subsequent option periods for an extended contract, or (2) seek to enter a new contract subject to certain conditions for the performance of such functions if there is not an option to extend the existing contract."
