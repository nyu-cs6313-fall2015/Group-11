  <summary>12/3/2013--Passed House amended.
TSA Loose Change Act - Directs the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security Administration [TSA] ) to transfer annually, based on requests for proposals, unclaimed money recovered at airport security checkpoints to nonprofit organizations that operate multiple airport centers throughout the United States to provide places of rest and recuperation for Armed Forces members and their families. (Currently, such moneys are retained by the TSA for civil aviation security.)

Amends the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2005 to repeal the requirement that the TSA Administrator report annually to Congress on how unclaimed money is being used to provide civil aviation security. Requires the Administrator, instead, to report on the amount of money transferred to nonprofit organizations.</summary>
