    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``State Regulatory Representation 
Clarification Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to reaffirm the importance of having the perspective of 
        State banking regulators on the Board of Directors of the 
        Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and
            (2) to ensure that the Board of Directors of the Federal 
        Deposit Insurance Corporation includes a member who has served 
        as a State banking supervisor.

SEC. 3. STATE BANKING SUPERVISOR EXPERIENCE ON BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 
              THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION.

    Section 2(a)(1)(C) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
1812(a)(1)(C)) is amended by striking ``State bank supervisory 
experience'' and inserting ``served as a State bank supervisor, as 
defined in section 3(r)(1) of this Act''.

SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    Nothing in this Act shall be construed as affecting the appointment 
or reappointment of individuals who were members of the Board of 
Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as of January 1, 
2014.
