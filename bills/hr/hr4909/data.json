Directs the Secretary to increase the proportion of the amounts expended by a state for caseworker training on child-focused recruitment and retention.\n\nIncreases the amount of spending for child welfare programs by the unused savings resulting from this Act.\n\nAmends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the cancellation of Federal Direct Student Loans for a social worker employed in a public child or family service agency after the social worker has made 60 monthly payments on the eligible loan after the enactment of this Act."
