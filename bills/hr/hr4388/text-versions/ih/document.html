                                 A BILL


 
To establish the American Indian Trust Review Commission, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Indian Trust Responsibility 
Review Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Final Report of the American Indian Policy Review 
        Committee, published in 1977, made a number of recommendations 
        regarding the United States administration of its trust 
        relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes and their 
        members, many of which have not been implemented.
            (2) There has been no general, comprehensive review of the 
        United States trust relationship with federally recognized 
        Indian tribes since the publication of the Final Report of the 
        American Indian Policy Review Committee.
            (3) The trust relationship has evolved over time and there 
        is a clear need to re-examine the administration of the United 
        States constitutional trust responsibility.
            (4) The duties administered by Federal agencies charged 
        with protecting federally recognized Indian tribal trust 
        resources and providing services often conflict with other 
        duties discharged by the same or separate Federal agencies and 
        departments and it is the beneficiaries of the trust 
        relationship that suffer as a result.
            (5) In carrying out its trust responsibilities to federally 
        recognized Indian tribes and their members, it is crucial that 
        Congress have the benefit of a review of the United States 
        trust relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes to 
        improve its ability to exercise oversight over the Executive 
        Branch, pursue policies to empower tribal self-determination, 
        and better administer the trust relationship.

SEC. 3. DECLARATION.

    Congress declares that it is timely and essential to conduct a 
review of the current state of the United States unique trust 
relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes and their members 
in order to better administer constitutional trust responsibilities and 
make necessary revisions in relevant trust statutes, regulations, and 
policies for the benefit of American Indian people.
