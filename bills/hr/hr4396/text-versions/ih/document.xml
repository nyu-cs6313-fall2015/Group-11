			<paragraph id="H6A392A2BA7CF4DF6910EB60CA2681166"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Deeply embedded in the history and traditions of the United States is the protection of religious
			 freedom. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution states <quote>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
			 exercise thereof</quote>, and thus, it gives general protection for individuals’ religious beliefs and practices.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HA30291E2457C4315BBDF6C80CF19800E"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Repeatedly during the existence of the United States, Congress has reaffirmed the freedom of
			 religion by enacting, among other things, title VII of the Civil Rights
			 Act of 1964, the Church amendment, the Weldon amendment, section 245 of
			 the Public Health Service Act, and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act
			 of 1993. Through their passage, the United States has augmented religious
			 freedoms and set the precedent of protection of conscience rights.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H6230A027474849AA8B6642153B48842C"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Weldon amendment has been regularly included in appropriations legislation for the Department
			 of Health and Human Services. The Weldon amendment prohibits Federal
			 agencies, States, and local governments that receive the appropriated
			 funds in the respective Act from discriminating among institutional or
			 individual health care professionals, organizations, facilities, and plans
			 on the basis of a health care entity’s refusal to provide, pay for,
			 provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H6DEC7B0BCA01427FA81785034ABFF760"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The United States has a history of protecting individuals, organizations, facilities, and plans
			 from being penalized or discriminated against due to their religious
			 beliefs and moral values. Until the enactment of the Patient Protection
			 and Affordable Care Act (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/111/148">Public Law 111–148</external-xref>), the Federal Government has
			 never sought to impose specific health care coverage or care requirements
			 that infringe on the conscience rights of insurers, purchasers of
			 insurance, plan sponsors, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders, such as
			 individual or institutional health care entities.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H48774420742443E08CBD6255A566E263"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act grants the Department of Health and Human Services
			 the authority to provide a list of detailed services to be included as
			 essential health benefits (as defined in section 1302(a) of the Patient
			 Protection and Affordable Care Act), and preventive health services
			 described in section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act. These services
			 represent a new nationwide coverage requirement for health plans.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H2AF70AE8B7C549D5BE8064BDCEF1BC03"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act provides a narrow exemption for religious groups
			 that object to participation in government health programs generally, but
			 it does not allow purchasers, plan sponsors, and other stakeholders with
			 religious or moral objections to specific required items or services to
			 decline providing or obtaining coverage of such items or services, or
			 allow health care entities with such objections to decline to provide
			 them.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H90F59CC5477143BFA46E6B3DBCD55043"><enum>(7)</enum><text>By creating new barriers to health insurance and causing the loss of existing insurance
			 arrangements, these inflexible mandates in the Patient Protection and
			 Affordable Care Act jeopardize the ability of individuals to exercise
			 their rights of conscience and their ability to freely participate in the
			 health insurance and health care marketplace.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HC77C47933DC54825A9851B43BDFA8794"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In a significant move from the current free insurance coverage market, the Department of Health and
			 Human Services issued an interim rule on August 1, 2011, requiring
			 individual and group health plans to cover free sterilization and all
			 contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HA68EDA1F5F874DDA9F9303AE8966225B"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Within the list of contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration are drugs containing
			 abortifacient substances and effects, including Levonorgestral commonly
			 known as Plan B and ulipristal acetate marketed as Ella. Thus, the Patient
			 Protection and Affordable Care Act effectively mandates employers to
			 provide health care insurance covering abortion drugs and services, which
			 is a violation of numerous Federal provisions aforementioned.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HFD287C652401472B9980754B2B3F9689"><enum>(10)</enum><text>On January 20, 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would not
			 broaden the religious exemption it included in its August 1, 2011, interim
			 rule. Instead, it gave institutions and employers with religious and moral
			 objections to including free sterilization and all contraceptives approved
			 by the Food and Drug Administration in their offered health insurance plan
			 an additional year to <quote>adapt</quote> their consciences to the mandate.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H6467D33DD5D443CA98C4D06ADF13CFA2"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In June 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services proposed a definition of “religious
			 employer” for purposes of the exemption from the contraceptive coverage
			 requirement. The exemption essentially only applies to formal houses of
			 worship. All other religiously affiliated entities must continue to comply
			 with the mandate or otherwise face a fine.</text>
