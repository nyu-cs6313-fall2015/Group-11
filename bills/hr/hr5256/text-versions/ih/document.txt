    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Discrimination in the Workplace 
Act''.

SEC. 2. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY ACT REQUIREMENTS.

    Section 15(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 
215(a)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (5), by striking the period at the end and 
        inserting ``; or''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(6) to discharge or in any other manner retaliate against 
        any employee because such employee has inquired about, 
        discussed, or disclosed comparative compensation information 
        for the purpose of determining whether the employer is 
        compensating an employee in a manner that provides equal pay 
        for equal work, except that this paragraph shall not apply to 
        instances in which an employee who has access to the wage 
        information of other employees as a part of such employee's job 
        functions discloses the wages of such other employees to an 
        individual who does not otherwise have access to such 
        information, unless such disclosure is in response to a charge 
        or complaint or in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, 
        hearing, or action under section 6(d), including an 
        investigation conducted by the employer.
Nothing in paragraph (6) shall be construed to limit the rights of an 
employee provided under any other provision of law.''.
                                 <all>
