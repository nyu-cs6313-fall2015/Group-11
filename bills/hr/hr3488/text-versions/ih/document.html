    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH PRECLEARANCE FACILITIES, CONDUCT 
              PRECLEARANCE OPERATIONS, AND PROVIDE CUSTOMS SERVICES

        referred to as the ``Secretary'') may, on or after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, establish a preclearance facility, 
        conduct preclearance operations, or provide customs services 
        outside the United States to prevent terrorists, terrorist

        access to the United States.
            (2) Non-applicability.--The provisions of paragraph (1) 
        shall not apply to any preclearance facility that was in 
        operation, operations that were being conducted, or customs 
        services that were being provided outside the United States 
        prior to the date of the enactment of this Act. Any 
        preclearance facility located, preclearance operations 
        conducted, or customs services provided at Abu Dhabi

        be, prior to the date of the enactment of this Act for purposes 
        of the preceding sentence, and no such facility, operations, or

                customs services outside the United States, the 
                Secretary shall provide to the appropriate 
                congressional committees a notice of intent to

                        carriers, and any associated job impacts on 
                        employees of such air carriers;
                            (iii) an assessment by the Secretary of the

                to the appropriate congressional committees, together 
                with the notice of intent required under subparagraph

        Not later than 60 days after receipt of such notice and 
        agreement, the Comptroller General of the United States shall 
        provide to the appropriate congressional committees an 
        assessment of the impacts on employment by United States air 
        carriers of the establishment of a preclearance facility, the 
        conduct of preclearance operations, or the provision of customs 
        services outside the United States as proposed under the notice 
        and agreement.
            (3) Effective date.--After providing a notice of intent 
        under paragraph (1)(A) with respect to an agreement to 
        establish a preclearance facility, conduct preclearance 
        operations, or provide customs services outside the United
