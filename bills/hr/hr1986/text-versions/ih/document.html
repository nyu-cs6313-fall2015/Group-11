SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. SEXUAL ASSAULT NURSE EXAMINERS-ADULT/ADOLESCENT.

    (a) Assignment to Certain Military Units.--Section 584 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 
112-81; 10 U.S.C. 1561 note) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections 
        (d) and (e), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new 
        subsection (c):
    ``(c) Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners-Adult/Adolescent.--
            ``(1) Assignment requirements.--The Secretary of each 
        military department shall assign at least one Sexual Assault 
        Nurse Examiner-Adult/Adolescent to each brigade or equivalent 
        unit level of each armed force under the jurisdiction of that 
        Secretary unless assignment to other units is determined to be 
        more practicable and effective by the Secretary of Defense. The 
        Secretary of the military department concerned may assign 
        additional Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners-Adult/Adolescent as 
        necessary based on the demographics or needs of a military 
        unit. The Secretary of the military department concerned may 
        waive the assignment requirement for a specific unit level if 
        that Secretary determines that compliance will impose an undue 
        burden, except that the Secretary shall notify Congress of each 
        waiver and explain how compliance would impose an undue burden.
            ``(2) Eligible persons.--On and after October 1, 2015, only 
        members of the armed forces and civilian employees of the 
        Department of Defense may be assigned to duty as a Sexual 
        Assault Nurse Examiner-Adult/Adolescent. The Secretary of the 
        military department concerned may satisfy paragraph (1) through 
        the assignment of additional personnel to a unit or by 
        assigning the duties of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner-Adult/
        Adolescent to current personnel of the unit, so long as such 
        personnel meet the training and certification requirements of 
        subsection (d).''.
    (b) Training and Certification.--Subsection (d) of such section, as 
redesignated by subsection (a)(1), is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``assigned under 
        subsection (a) and Sexual Assault Victim Advocates assigned 
        under subsection (b)'' and inserting ``, Sexual Assault Victim 
        Advocates, and Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners-Adult/Adolescent 
        assigned under this section'';
            (2) in paragraph (2), by adding at the end the following 
        new sentence: ``In the case of the curriculum and other 
        components of the program for certification of Sexual Assault 
        Nurse Examiners-Adult/Adolescent, the Secretary of Defense 
        shall consult with the Commission for Forensic Nursing 
        Certification.''; and
            (3) in paragraph (3), by adding at the end the following 
        new sentence: ``On and after October 1, 2015, before a member 
        or civilian employee may be assigned to duty as a Sexual 
        Assault Nurse Examiner-Adult/Adolescent under subsection (c), 
        the member or employee must have completed the training program 
        required by paragraph (1) and obtained the certification.''.
    (c) Clerical Amendment.--The heading of such section is amended to 
read as follows:

``SEC. 584. SEXUAL ASSAULT RESPONSE COORDINATORS, SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM 
              ADVOCATES, AND SEXUAL ASSAULT NURSE EXAMINERS-ADULT/
              ADOLESCENT.''.
