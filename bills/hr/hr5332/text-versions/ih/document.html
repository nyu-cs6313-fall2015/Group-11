                                 A BILL


 
    To promote identification of veterans and their health needs in 
  furnishing of items and services under the Medicare, Medicaid, and 
                other programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Serving America's 
Veterans Effectively Act of 2014'' or the ``SAVE Act of 2014''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Veterans often have unique health needs that may be 
        related to their service to the American people and may be more 
        at risk for certain conditions, including cancer, infectious 
        diseases, musculoskeletal problems, post-traumatic stress 
        disorder, traumatic brain injury, dermatological problems, 
        reproductive health issues, and other conditions.
            (2) As part of a detailed patient history, knowing whether 
        or not a patient is a veteran helps a physician to make 
        accurate treatment recommendations or carry out needed 
        screenings.
            (3) If a physician is not aware that a patient is a 
        veteran, the physician may not think to perform recommended 
        screenings or be able to diagnose symptoms that at first seemed 
        unconnected. As a result, the patient and the patient's family 
        may suffer as medical problems go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.
            (4) Physicians routinely ask about similar types of patient 
        history that can affect current health status, such as whether 
        a patient has a family history of certain conditions or was 
        exposed to certain environmental factors. Questions about 
        veteran status give patients the opportunity to voluntarily 
        answer with information that can help their physicians better 
        establish a course of treatment.
            (5) Making the question of whether a patient served in the 
        Armed Forces part of consistently used frameworks, such as the 
        ``Welcome to Medicare'' physical examination and Medicare 
        Electronic Health Record program, ensures that it will become 
        part of clinicians' routine for new patients.
            (6) While many physicians, such as those working at 
        Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, may already be aware 
        of their patients' experiences in the Armed Forces, there are 
        indications that as much as 70 percent of veterans seek care 
        from other facilities.
            (7) Many organizations serving both veterans and health 
        care professionals currently work to educate health providers 
        on the health needs of veterans and appropriate medical care 
        that should be provided. Additional Federal support is needed 
        to ensure that all physicians are properly prepared to diagnose 
        and treat patients upon learning that they have served in the 
        Armed Forces.

SEC. 2. ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE IDENTIFICATION AND AWARENESS OF VETERANS 
              HEALTH NEEDS IN FURNISHING ITEMS AND SERVICES UNDER 
              MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND OTHER PROGRAMS.

    (a) Inclusion of Veteran Status in Patient Information for 
Meaningful Use of Electronic Health Records Under Medicare and 
Medicaid.--In establishing regulations regarding what constitutes 
meaningful use with respect electronic health records in applying 
sections 1848(o), 1853(m), 1886(b)(3)(B)(ix), and 1886(n)(3) of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-4(o), 1395w-23(m), 
1395ww(b)(3)(B)(ix), 1395ww(n)(3)) and related provisions of title XIX 
of such Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall include 
in the patient information required for meaningful use whether or not 
the patient served in the Armed Forces.
    (b) Identification of Veterans as Part of Individual History in 
Welcome to Medicare Visit.--In carrying out section 1861(ww) of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(ww)), the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services shall include, as a component of reviewing an 
individual's medical and social history under an initial preventive 
physical examination under section 410.16 of title 42, Code of Federal 
Regulations, an inquiry as to whether the individual served in the 
Armed Forces and any relevant circumstances relating to that 
individual's service that may bear on the medical or social condition 
of that individual.
    (c) Additional Activities To Improve Awareness of Veterans' Health 
Care Needs.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take such 
additional actions, otherwise authorized under law, as may be 
appropriate to promote awareness, among non-governmental physicians in 
their furnishing services, of the special circumstances and health care 
needs of veterans.

SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR PROVIDER EDUCATION ON HEALTH TREATMENT FOR VETERANS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services may 
make grants to organizations for the purpose of educating health care 
providers on appropriate health care treatment for patients who have 
served in the Armed Forces. Such grants shall be awarded under such 
terms and conditions as the Secretary shall specify.
    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated $10,000,000 to carry out this section, which shall remain 
available until expended.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
