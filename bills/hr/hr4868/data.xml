  <summary>6/12/2014--Introduced.
Moving to Work Expansion Act of 2014 - Increases the number of public housing agencies (PHAs) authorized to participate in the Moving-to-Work demonstration program by 10 over the number of PHAs currently authorized.

Authorizes the selection of a PHA for participation in the demonstration program only if it administers, in the aggregate, 10,000 or more public housing dwelling units and housing choice vouchers under Section 8 (rental assistance voucher program) of the United States Housing Act of 1937.

Prohibits selected PHAs from being provided any funding from low-income housing assistance, the Capital Fund, or the Operating Fund under the Act in addition to the funding they would otherwise receive without such participation.</summary>
