                                 A BILL


 
  To amend chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code, to require the 
 Director of the Office of Management and Budget to annually submit to 
 Congress a report on all disaster-related assistance provided by the 
                          Federal Government.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Disclosing Aid Spent to Ensure 
Relief Act'' or the ``DISASTER Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) At a time of constrained budgets, it is fiscally 
        prudent to understand the amount and the scope of the Federal 
        Government's involvement in providing disaster-related 
        assistance to communities in need.
            (2) The Federal Government does not provide a single, 
        publicly available estimate of the amount it is spending on 
        disaster-related assistance.
            (3) Because recovery is a long-term process, providing 
        disaster-related assistance requires significant Federal 
        resources to support a multi-agency, multi-year restoration of 
        infrastructure and commerce in affected communities.
            (4) Understanding the expenditures of individual Federal 
        agencies for disaster-related assistance will help better 
        inform the congressional appropriations process, as well as 
        presidential budget requests.
            (5) Knowledge about disaster-related expenses will 
        illustrate opportunities for reducing these expenses through 
        efforts to reduce vulnerabilities to future natural disasters.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to require the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget to annually submit to Congress a report on all 
disaster-related assistance provided by the Federal Government.

SEC. 4. REPORTING OF DISASTER-RELATED ASSISTANCE.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 11 of title 31, United States Code, is
