the time of termination of a plan under this title, or at the time of 
freezing benefit accruals under a plan pursuant to subsections (a)(1) 
and (b) of section 402 of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, 
regulations prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration required

after attaining any age before age 65, this paragraph shall be applied 
to an individual who is a participant in the plan by reason of such 
service by substituting such age for age 65. The calculation of benefit 
liabilities and unfunded benefit liabilities under this section, and

to an individual who is a participant in the plan by reason of such 
service by substituting such age for age 65.''.
