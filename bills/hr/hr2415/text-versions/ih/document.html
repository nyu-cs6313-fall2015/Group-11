To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to include information 
  on the coverage of intensive behavioral therapy for obesity in the 
   Medicare and You Handbook and to provide for the coordination of 
     programs to prevent and treat obesity, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 35 
        percent of adults aged 65 and over were obese in the period of 
        2007 through 2010, representing over 8 million adults aged 65 
        through 74.
            (2) Obesity increases the risk for chronic diseases and 
        conditions, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and 
        type 2 diabetes.
            (3) More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are treated 
        for 5 or more chronic conditions per year. The rate of obesity 
        among Medicare patients doubled from 1987 to 2002, and spending 
        on those individuals more than doubled.
            (4) Obese men and women at age 65 have decreased life 
        expectancy of 1.6 years for men and 1.4 years for women.
            (5) The direct and indirect cost of obesity is more than 
        $450 billion annually.
            (6) On average, an obese Medicare beneficiary costs $1,964 
        more than a normal-weight beneficiary.
            (7) The prevalence of obesity among older Americans is 
        growing at a linear rate and, left unchanged, nearly half of 
        the elderly population will be obese in 2030 according to a 
        Congressional Research Report on obesity.

behavioral therapy for obesity furnished outside of the primary care

recommendations or treatment plan for the individual to the 
individual's primary care physician or practitioner.''.
