        installation of an ignition interlock device for a minimum of 
        180 days on each motor vehicle operated by an individual who is 
        convicted of driving while intoxicated or driving under the 
        influence.
            ``(2) Exception.--The 180-day period referred to in 
        paragraph (1) for the installation of an ignition interlock 
        device may be reduced to period of not fewer than 90 days, if--

            ``(1) Fiscal year 2016.--On October 1, 2015, the Secretary 
        shall withhold 1 percent of the amount required to be

        subsection (b).
            ``(2) Fiscal year 2017.--On October 1, 2016, the Secretary 
        shall withhold 3 percent of the amount required to be

        subsection (b).
            ``(3) Fiscal year 2018 and thereafter.--On October 1, 2017, 
        and on October 1 of each fiscal year thereafter, the Secretary 
        shall withhold 5 percent of the amount required to be

        shall remain available for apportionment to the State until the 
        end of the third fiscal year following the fiscal year for 
        which the funds are authorized to be appropriated.
            ``(2) Apportionment of withheld funds after compliance.--
        If, before the last day of the period for which funds withheld 
        under subsection (c) from apportionment are to remain available 
        for apportionment to a State under paragraph (1), the State 
        meets the requirements of subsection (b), the Secretary shall, 
        on the first day on which the State meets the requirements of 
        subsection (b), apportion to the State the funds withheld under 
        subsection (c) that remain available for apportionment to the 
        State.
            ``(3) Period of availability of subsequently apportioned 
        funds.--Any funds apportioned pursuant to paragraph (2)--
                    ``(A) shall remain available for expenditure until

                shall lapse.
            ``(4) Effect of noncompliance.--If, at the end of the 
        period for which funds withheld under subsection (c) from 
        apportionment are available for apportionment to a State under 
        paragraph (1), the State does not meet the requirements of
