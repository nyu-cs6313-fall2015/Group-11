                section 201(b) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, 
                Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003).

        Secretary of Health and Human Services determines requires 
        State legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) 
        in order for the plan to meet the additional requirements 
        imposed by the amendment made by subsection (a), the State plan 
        shall not be regarded as failing to comply with the 
        requirements of such title solely on the basis of its failure 
        to meet these additional requirements before the first day of 
        the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of the 
        first regular session of the State legislature that begins 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act. For purposes of 
        the previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year

        pocket costs, for health care services that individuals find 
        useful in making decisions about where, when, and from whom to 
        receive care;
            (2) how the types of information valued by individuals for 
        making such decisions vary by whether they have health benefits 
        coverage and, if they do, the type of such coverage they have, 
        such as traditional insurance, health maintenance 
        organizations, preferred provider organizations, and high 
        deductible plans coupled with health savings accounts; and
            (3) ways in which such information may be made available on 
        a timely basis and in easy-to-understand form to individuals 
        facing such decisions.
    (b) Report.--The Director of AHRQ shall report to the Congress on 
the results of such research not later than 18 months after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, together with recommendations for ways in 
which the Federal Government can assist the States in achieving the 
objective specified in subsection (a)(3).
    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.
