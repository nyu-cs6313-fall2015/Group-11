 To amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to require each 
 voter registration agency in a State which requires an individual to 
  present a government-issued photo identification as a condition of 
      voting in an election for Federal office to provide such an 
 identification without charge upon request to any such individual who 
        does not otherwise possess one, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Voter ID Accessibility Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. REQUIRING STATES WITH PHOTO IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENT FOR 
              VOTING TO PROVIDE IDENTIFICATION TO INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT 
              IDENTIFICATION.

    (a) Requirement.--Section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act 
of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg-5) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(e) Provision of Photo Identification by States Requiring Photo 
Identification as Condition of Voting.--If a State has in effect a 
requirement that an individual present a government-issued photo 
identification as a condition of voting in an election for Federal 
office held in the State (or, in the case of an individual who wishes 
to vote by mail in such an election, a copy of a government-issued 
photo identification)--
            ``(1) in the case of an individual who is an applicant to 
        register to vote in the State, each voter registration agency 
        in the State shall, at the time the agency provides the 
        individual with a voter registration application form, notify 
        the individual of such requirement and provide the individual 
        with such an identification without charge upon request;
            ``(2) in the case of an individual who is registered to 
        vote in the State but does not otherwise possess such an 
        identification, the State shall, at such time and in accordance 
        with such procedures as the State may require, notify the 
        individual of such requirement and provide the individual with 
        such an identification without charge upon request, so long as 
        the State provides the individual with reasonable opportunities 
        to obtain the identification prior to the date of the election; 
        and
            ``(3) in the case of an individual who requests that a 
        voter registration agency provide the individual with such an 
        identification under paragraph (1) or paragraph (2), the State 
        shall provide the individual with such assistance without 
        charge upon request as may be necessary to enable the 
        individual to obtain and process any documentation necessary to 
        obtain the identification.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall apply 
with respect to elections held on or after the 90-day period which 
begins on the date of the enactment of this Act.
                                 <all>
