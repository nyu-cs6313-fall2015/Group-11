                local government located within the State, submit a 
                notice of past-due, legally enforceable local tax 
                obligation for offset under this subsection.
                    ``(B) Special rules.--Such submission and offset 
                shall be made with respect to any past-due, legally 
                enforceable local tax obligation under rules similar to 
                the rules of this subsection, except--
                            ``(i) under paragraph (3)(A), any reduction 
                        attributable to a past-due, legally enforceable 
                        local tax obligation shall be made (in addition 
                        to reductions specified in such subparagraph) 
                        after the overpayment is reduced pursuant to--
                                    ``(I) this subsection with respect 
                                to any past-due, legally enforceable 
                                State income tax obligation; and
                                    ``(II) subsection (f) with respect 
                                to any covered unemployment 
                                compensation debt; and
                            ``(ii) the local government on whose behalf 
                        a State is submitting shall certify to the 
                        State that the requirements of paragraph (4) 
                        have been met by the local government.
                    ``(C) Past-due, legally enforceable local tax 
                obligation.--For purposes of this subsection, the term 
                `past-due, legally enforceable local tax obligation' 
                means any debt--
                            ``(i)(I) which resulted from a judgment 
                        rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, 
                        or a determination after an administrative 
                        hearing, which has determined an amount of tax 
                        to be due to a local government; and
                            ``(II) which is no longer subject to 
                        judicial review; or
                            ``(ii) which resulted from a tax imposed by 
                        a local government which has been assessed but 
                        not collected, the time for redetermination of 
                        which has expired, and which has not been 
                        delinquent for more than 10 years.
                Such term shall not include any local income tax 
                described in the second sentence of paragraph (5).
                    ``(D) Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue such 
                regulations, and modify any such regulations under 
                paragraph (6), as may be necessary to carry out the 
                purposes of this paragraph.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to refunds payable after the date of the enactment of this Act.
