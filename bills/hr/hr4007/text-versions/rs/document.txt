<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Chemical Facility Anti-
Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 
2014''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. CHEMICAL FACILITY ANTI-TERRORISM STANDARDS 
              PROGRAM.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) In General.--The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 
U.S.C. 101 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:</DELETED>

        <DELETED>``TITLE XXI--CHEMICAL FACILITY ANTI-TERRORISM 
                          STANDARDS</DELETED>

<DELETED>``SEC. 2101. CHEMICAL FACILITY ANTI-TERRORISM STANDARDS 
              PROGRAM.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    ``(a) Program Established.--There is in the Department a 
Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program. Under such Program, 
the Secretary shall establish risk-based performance standards designed 
to protect covered chemical facilities and chemical facilities of 
interest from acts of terrorism and other security risks and require 
such facilities to submit security vulnerability assessments and to 
develop and implement site security plans.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    ``(b) Security Measures.--Site security plans required 
under subsection (a) may include layered security measures that, in 
combination, appropriately address the security vulnerability 
assessment and the risk-based performance standards for security for 
the facility.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    ``(c) Approval or Disapproval of Site Security Plans.--
</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall review and 
        approve or disapprove each security vulnerability assessment 
        and site security plan under subsection (a). The Secretary may 
        not disapprove a site security plan based on the presence or 
        absence of a particular security measure, but the Secretary 
        shall disapprove a site security plan if the plan fails to 
        satisfy the risk-based performance standards established under 
        subsection (a).</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    ``(2) Alternative security programs.--The 
        Secretary may approve an alternative security program 
        established by a private sector entity or a Federal, State, or 
        local authority or pursuant to other applicable laws, if the 
        Secretary determines that the requirements of such program meet 
        the requirements of this section. A covered chemical facility 
        may meet the site security plan requirement under subsection 
        (a) by adopting an alternative security program that has been 
        reviewed and approved by the Secretary under this 
        paragraph.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    ``(3) Site security plan assessments.--In 
        approving or disapproving a site security plan under this 
        subsection, the Secretary shall employ the risk assessment 
        policies and procedures developed under this title. In the case 
        of a covered chemical facility for which a site security plan 
        has been approved by the Secretary before the date of the 
        enactment of this title, the Secretary may not require the 
        resubmission of the site security information solely by reason 
        of the enactment of this title.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    ``(4) Consultation.--The Secretary may consult 
        with the Government Accountability Office to investigate the 
        feasibility and applicability a third party accreditation 
        program that would work with industry stakeholders to develop 
        site security plans that may be applicable to all similarly 
        situated facilities. The program would include the development 
        of Program-Specific Handbooks for facilities to reference on 
        site.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    ``(d) Compliance.--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    ``(1) Audits and inspections.--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall 
                conduct the audit and inspection of covered chemical 
                facilities for the purpose of determining compliance 
                with this Act. The audit and inspection may be carried 
                out by a non-Department or nongovernment entity, as 
                approved by the Secretary.</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    ``(B) Reporting structure.--Any audit or 
                inspection conducted by an individual employed by a 
                nongovernment entity shall be assigned in coordination 
                with the head of audits and inspections for the region 
                in which the audit or inspection is to be conducted. 
                When in the field, any individual employed by a 
                nongovernment entity shall report to the respective 
                head of audits and inspections for the region in which 
                the individual is operating.</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    ``(C) Requirements for nongovernment 
                personnel.--If the Secretary arranges for an audit or 
                inspection under subparagraph (A) to be carried out by 
                a nongovernment entity, the Secretary shall require, as 
                a condition of such arrangement, that any individual 
                who conducts the audit or inspection be a citizen of
