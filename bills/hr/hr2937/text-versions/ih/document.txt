 To amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act with respect to the 
 guidelines for specification of certain disposal sites for dredged or 
                             fill material.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Commonsense Permitting for Job 
Creation Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. GUIDELINES FOR SPECIFICATION OF CERTAIN DISPOSAL SITES.

    Section 404(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 
U.S.C. 1344(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
sentence: ``Such guidelines may not prohibit the specification of a 
site due to the lack of a final site plan resulting from the lack of an 
identified end user or industry or industrial classification for the 
site when determining whether there is a practicable alternative to a 
proposed discharge that would result in less adverse impact on the 
aquatic ecosystem.''.
