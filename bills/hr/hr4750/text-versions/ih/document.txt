        by a health care provider to a patient in any medical 
        malpractice or medical product liability action or claim; or
            (2) to preempt any standard of care or duty of care, owed 
        by a health care provider to a patient, duly established under 
        State or common law.
    (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:
            (1) Federal health care provision.--The term ``Federal 
        health care provision'' means any provision of the Patient 
        Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), title 
        I or subtitle B of title II of the Health Care and Education 
        Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), or title XVIII 
        or XIX of the Social Security Act.
            (2) Health care provider.--The term ``health care 
        provider'' means any individual or entity--

                Federal or State laws or regulations to provide health 
                care services; or
                    (B) required to be so licensed, registered, or 
                certified but that is exempted by other statute or 
                regulation.
            (3) Medical malpractice or medical product liability action 
        or claim.--The term ``medical malpractice or medical product 
        liability action or claim'' means a medical malpractice action 
        or claim (as defined in section 431(7) of the Health Care 
        Quality Improvement Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11151(7))) and 
        includes a liability action or claim relating to a health care
