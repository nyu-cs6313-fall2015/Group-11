                for protection against losses arising from acts of 
                terrorism. Therefore, nothing in this title shall 
                prohibit insurers from developing risk-sharing 
                mechanisms (including mutual reinsurance facilities and 
                agreements, use of the capital markets, and insurance-
                linked securities) to voluntarily reinsure terrorism 
                losses between and among themselves that are not 
                subject to reimbursement under this section.

            (1) assessing and collecting upfront premiums on insurers 
        that participate in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program 
        established under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (15 
        U.S.C. 6701 note) (in this section referred to as the 
        ``Program''), which shall include a comparison of practices in 
        international markets to assess and collect premiums either

                participate in the Program;
                    (B) how the Federal Government could collect such 
                upfront premiums;
                    (C) how the Federal Government could ensure that 
                such upfront premiums are not spent for purposes other 
                than satisfying claims through the Program;
                    (D) how the assessment and collection of such 
                upfront premiums could affect take-up rates for 
                terrorism risk coverage in different regions and 
                industries;
                    (E) the effect of collecting such upfront premiums 
                on the private market for terrorism risk reinsurance;

                under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program and the 
                ability of the Program to meet its statutory purposes;
                    (B) how a capital reserve fund would impact 
                insurers and reinsurers, including liquidity, insurance 
                pricing, and capacity to provide terrorism risk 
                coverage;
                    (C) the feasibility of segregating funds 
                attributable to terrorism risk from funds attributable 
                to other insurance lines;
                    (D) how a capital reserve fund would be viewed and 
                treated under current Financial Accounting Standards 
                Board accounting rules and the tax laws; and
                    (E) how a capital reserve fund would affect the 
                States' ability to regulate insurers participating in

        markets referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection 
        (A), how other countries, if any--
                    (A) have established terrorism insurance 
                structures;
                    (B) charge premiums or otherwise collect funds to 
                pay for the costs of terrorism insurance structures, 
                including risk and administrative costs; and
                    (C) have established capital reserve funds to pay 
                for the costs of terrorism insurance structures.
            (4) Duration.--With respect to the capital reserve fund 
        described in subsection (a)(2), how the duration of the Program 
        would affect the viability of such capital reserve fund.

(a), the Comptroller General shall submit a report on the results of 
such study to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of 
the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of

        separate classes of membership, with separate criteria, if the 
        Association reasonably determines that performance of different 
        duties requires different levels of education, training, 
        experience, or other qualifications.
            ``(2) Business entities.--The Association shall establish a 
        class of membership and membership criteria for business 
        entities. A business entity that applies for membership shall 
        be required to designate an individual Association member 
        responsible for the compliance of the business entity with 
        Association standards and the insurance laws, standards, and

                on the types of licensing categories that exist under 
                State laws.

            ``(1) In general.--The Association may establish criteria 
        for membership which shall include standards for personal 
        qualifications, education, training, and experience. The 
        Association shall not establish criteria that unfairly limit 
        the ability of a small insurance producer to become a member of 
        the Association, including imposing discriminatory membership 
        fees.

        paragraph (1), the Association shall not adopt any 
        qualification less protective to the public than that contained

        Model Act in effect as of the date of enactment of the National 
        Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of
