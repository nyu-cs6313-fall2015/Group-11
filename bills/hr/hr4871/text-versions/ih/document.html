        in which such insurer is domiciled and is determined by such 
        State insurance regulatory authority to meet such requirements 
        for financial hardship or financial infeasibility of providing 
        coverage for insured losses as the Secretary shall establish in 
        such regulations. The insurer shall provide notice, in a manner 
        satisfactory to the State insurance regulatory authority,

                for protection against losses arising from acts of 
                terrorism. Therefore, nothing in this title shall 
                prohibit insurers from developing risk-sharing 
                mechanisms (including mutual reinsurance facilities and 
                agreements, use of the capital markets, and insurance-
                linked securities) to voluntarily reinsure terrorism 
                losses between and among themselves that are not 
                subject to reimbursement under this section.

    (a) Study.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall 
complete a study on the viability of the Federal Government--
            (1) assessing and collecting upfront premiums on insurers 
        that participate in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program 
        established under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (15 
        U.S.C. 6701 note) (in this section referred to as the 
        ``Program''), which shall include a comparison of practices in 
        international markets to assess and collect premiums either 
        before or after terrorism losses are incurred; and

        requiring insurers participating in the Program to dedicate 
        capital specifically for terrorism losses before such losses 
        are incurred, which shall include a comparison of practices in 
        international markets to establish reserve funds.
    (b) Required Content.--The study required under subsection (a) 
shall examine, but shall not be limited to, the following issues:
            (1) Upfront premiums.--With respect to upfront premiums 
        described in subsection (a)(1)--
                    (A) how the Federal Government could determine the 
                price of such upfront premiums on insurers that 
                participate in the Program;
                    (B) how the Federal Government could collect such 
                upfront premiums;
                    (C) how the Federal Government could ensure that 
                such upfront premiums are not spent for purposes other 
                than satisfying claims through the Program;
                    (D) how the assessment and collection of such 
                upfront premiums could affect take-up rates for 
                terrorism risk coverage in different regions and 
                industries;
                    (E) the effect of collecting such upfront premiums 
                on the private market for terrorism risk reinsurance; 
                and
                    (F) the size of the Federal Government subsidy

        reserve fund described in subsection (a)(2)--
                    (A) how the creation of a capital reserve fund 
                would affect the Federal Government's fiscal exposure 
                under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program and the 
                ability of the Program to meet its statutory purposes;
                    (B) how a capital reserve fund would impact 
                insurers and reinsurers, including liquidity, insurance 
                pricing, and capacity to provide terrorism risk 
                coverage;
                    (C) the feasibility of segregating funds 
                attributable to terrorism risk from funds attributable 
                to other insurance lines;
                    (D) how a capital reserve fund would be viewed and 
                treated under current Financial Accounting Standards 
                Board accounting rules and the tax laws; and
                    (E) how a capital reserve fund would affect the 
                States' ability to regulate insurers participating in 
                the Program.

                structures;
                    (B) charge premiums or otherwise collect funds to 
                pay for the costs of terrorism insurance structures, 
                including risk and administrative costs; and
                    (C) have established capital reserve funds to pay 
                for the costs of terrorism insurance structures.
            (4) Duration.--With respect to the capital reserve fund 
        described in subsection (a)(2), how the duration of the Program 
        would affect the viability of such capital reserve fund.

(a), the Comptroller General shall submit a report on the results of 
such study to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of 
the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of
