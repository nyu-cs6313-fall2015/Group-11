Directs the Secretary to ensure that the deed for those federal coal mineral interests includes a covenant, running with the land, that precludes surface mining of the coal absent the written consent of the surface owner.\n\nRequires the coal and iron ore mineral interests conveyed to the Tribe under this Act to be held, upon the Tribe's request, in trust for the Tribe.\n\nProhibits Montana from taxing the mineral interests this Act conveys to the Tribe.\n\nRequires that, in return for this Act's mineral conveyances:\n\n the Tribe must waive all of its claims arising from the continuing failure of the United States to acquire those private coal and iron ore mineral interests in trust for the Tribe as part of its Reservation as directed by Congress in 1900, and Great Northern Properties must waive any claim against the United States relating to the value or completion of this Act's conveyances of mineral interests. Requires the Northern Cheyenne Trust Fund (Fund) to be transferred to the Tribe and deposited into the Tribe's Permanent Fund. Requires the Tribe, in return for such transfer, to waive all of its claims arising from U.S. management of the Fund."
