                                 A BILL


 
   To require automobile manufacturers to disclose to consumers the 
     presence of event data recorders, or ``black boxes'', on new 
automobiles, and to require manufacturers to provide the consumer with 
  the option to enable and disable such devices on future automobiles.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Black Box Privacy Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Consumers have the right to know that event data 
        recorders are installed in their vehicles, that they are 
        capable of collecting data recorded in automobile accidents, 
        and how such data may be used.
            (2) From the standpoint of consumer privacy rights, most 
        consumers are not aware that their vehicles are recording data 
        that not only may be used to aid traffic safety analyses, but 
        has the potential of being used against them in a civil or 
        criminal proceeding, or by their insurer to increase rates.

              MOTORCYCLES.
