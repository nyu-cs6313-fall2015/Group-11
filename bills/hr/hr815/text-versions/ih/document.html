                business concern may designate any dividend paid by 
                such corporation as an increased-wage exempt-dividend

                    ``(A) no gain shall be recognized on any increased-
                wage partnership distribution, and
                    ``(B) in the case of an increased-wage partnership 
                distribution with respect to which no gain is 
                recognized under section 731(a)(2), no reduction shall 
                be made to the adjusted basis to the partner of his

                year.
            ``(2) Qualified wages.--The term `qualified wages' has the 
        meaning which would be given such term by section 3121(a) if
