 To provide for access to health insurance coverage of life-sustaining 
               treatments furnished by certain providers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PROVIDING FOR ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE OF LIFE-
              SUSTAINING TREATMENTS FURNISHED BY CERTAIN PROVIDERS.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the 
case of an individual who resides in a State and who as of December 31 
of a year had in effect health insurance coverage that provided 
benefits for a life-sustaining treatment, with respect to a health 
condition of such individual, furnished by a provider that before such 
date furnished one or more services to such individual related to such 
condition, if--
            (1) such coverage for such individual is not continued for 
        the plan year beginning after such date; and
            (2) there is no health insurance coverage offered in such 
        State that provides for coverage of such life-saving treatment 
        by such provider;
the individual may enroll in health insurance coverage offered in any 
other State, which provides for coverage of such operation by such 
provider, as if such individual were a resident of such other State.
    (b) Life-Sustaining Treatment Defined.--For purposes of subsection 
(a), the term ``life-sustaining treatment'' means, with respect to an 
individual, any medical device or procedure, including a drug, 
ventilator, surgery, therapy, or artificially provided fluids and 
nutrients, that, as certified by the health care provider of such 
individual, is required to increase life expectancy of such individual 
by restoring or taking over a vital bodily function.
                                 <all>
