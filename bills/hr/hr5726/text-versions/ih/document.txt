    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:

                revenue; and

            (2) Drilling in ANWR is supported by American Indians and 
        Alaskan Natives.
            (3) Drilling in ANWR will have minimal direct environmental 
        impact.
            (4) Drilling in ANWR will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign

expediently and promptly issue permits to allow for energy resources 
exploration and extraction in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
