SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Hank Aaron Congressional Gold Medal 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Henry Louis ``Hank'' Aaron was born in Mobile, Alabama 
        on February 5, 1934, to Herbert and Estella Aaron.
            (2) One of baseball's greatest players, Hank Aaron broke 
        many of the sport's most distinguished records including the 
        career home run record, which he held for over 33 years.
            (3) Hank Aaron began his baseball career while still in 
        high school, playing semi-professionally for the Mobile Black 
        Bears. He continued on to the Indianapolis Clowns whom he 
        helped lead to victory in the Negro League World Series.
            (4) Hank Aaron rocketed through the Minor Leagues, being 
        named the Northern League Rookie of the Year playing for the 
        Eau Claire Bears in 1952 and MVP of the South Atlantic League 
        playing for the Jacksonville Tars in 1953.
            (5) In 1954 Hank Aaron started his 23-year career in Major 
        League Baseball playing for the Milwaukee Braves. He played 
        with the Braves for 21 years, following them to Atlanta when 
        they moved in 1966. In his final two years in the Major League, 
        he played for the Milwaukee Brewers.
            (6) To this day, Hank Aaron holds several Major League 
        records, including most career RBIs (2,297), most career extra 
        base hits (1,477), most career total bases (6,856), and most 
        consecutive seasons with 150 or more hits (17).
            (7) On April 8, 1974, Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's career 
        home run record. At the end of his career, Hank Aaron had 755 
        home runs, a record that was not beaten until 2007 by Barry 
        Bonds.
            (8) Hank Aaron made the All Star Team for 21 consecutive 
        years, from 1955 to 1975.
            (9) Hank Aaron has received numerous awards for his prowess 
        in Major League baseball, including 3 Golden Gloves, 2 National 
        League batting titles, 4 National League home run champion 
        titles, and the Major League Lou Gehrig Memorial Award. He was 
        also named National League MVP in 1957.
            (10) Hank Aaron has been recognized for his success by many 
        people and institutions. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall 
        of Fame in 1982, received a Presidential Citizens Medal from 
        President Bill Clinton, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom 
        from President George W. Bush. He was awarded the Spingarn 
        Medal from the NAACP ('76) for outstanding achievement by an 
        African American.
            (11) A great sportsman who constantly pushed the limits of 
        the game, as well as the cultural limits of the time, Hank 
        Aaron is a true American role model and will inspire Americans 
        for generations to come.
