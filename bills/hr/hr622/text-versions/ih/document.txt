                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of the Interior to develop, maintain, and 
  administer an annex in Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
   Islands, as an extension of the American Memorial Park located in 
                    Saipan, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. AMERICAN MEMORIAL PARK ANNEX IN TINIAN.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``American 
Memorial Park Tinian Annex Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) In 2001 the National Park Service conducted a 
        suitability and feasibility study of North Field on the island 
        of Tinian, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, for 
        inclusion in the National Park System.
            (2) North Field Tinian is listed on the National Register 
        of Historic Places as an historic district and has been 
        designated a national historic landmark.
            (3) The Department of Defense holds a 50-year lease over 
        North Field Tinian.
            (4) The National Park Service determined that North Field 
        Tinian was suitable for inclusion as ``one of the most 
        significant World War II sites in the Pacific'' because atomic 
        bombs were flown to Hiroshima and Nagasaki from this site.
            (5) The National Park Service determined, however, that it 
        was not feasible to include North Field Tinian as a unit of the 
        National Park System because of the ``military's future long 
        term needs''.
            (6) American Memorial Park on the island of Saipan, 
        Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, is managed by the 
        National Park Service, as authorized under Public Law 94-241 
        and Public Law 95-348, to commemorate the World War II Marianas 
        Campaign.
            (7) A Tinian Annex to the American Memorial Park could 
        provide the opportunity for on and off site interpretation of 
        North Field without conflicting with military needs.
    (c) Establishment.--Using existing facilities instead of developing 
new facilities to the extent practicable, the Secretary of the 
Interior, acting through the National Park Service, shall develop, 
maintain, and administer an annex in Tinian, Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, as an extension of the American Memorial Park 
located in Saipan, on an appropriate parcel of Tinian Public Land to be 
agreed upon by the National Park Service and the Governor of the 
Northern Mariana Islands in consultation with the Mayor of Tinian. The 
annex shall be used to--
            (1) interpret the important aspects of North Field by 
        highlighting the historic events related to the World War II 
        Marianas Campaign; and
            (2) serve as a curatorial storage of World War II 
        artifacts.
                                 <all>
