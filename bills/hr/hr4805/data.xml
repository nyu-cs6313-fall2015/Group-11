  <summary>6/5/2014--Introduced.
No Subsidies Without Verification Act of 2014 - Disallows the health plan premium assistance tax credit or cost-sharing reduction under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act before the first date of the first coverage month beginning on or after the date on which the process to verify an individual's household income and coverage requirements of such individual for purposes of determining eligibility for, and the accurate amount of, the credit or reduction, respectively, has been completed.

Requires for such verification: (1) completion of a manual or electronic review of the information required of an applicant for enrollment in a plan, and (2) resolution of any inconsistency of such information with records of the Departments of the Treasury or Homeland Security (DHS) or the Social Security Administration.

Exempts individuals from the penalty for not maintaining minimum essential coverage for any month with respect to which a premium tax credit is being claimed and that begins before the date on which the verification process has been completed.

Suspends, until the coverage month beginning after eligibility verification has been completed, the premium tax credit and reduced cost-sharing in the case of individuals for whom the subsidy was allowed before enactment of this Act. Provides a special enrollment period for an individual who terminated enrollment in a qualified plan during the period of suspension.</summary>
