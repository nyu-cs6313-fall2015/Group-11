                participation, the employee may not elect to resume 
                participation until the beginning of the next calendar

        $5,000 per year to a USA Retirement Fund on behalf of each 
        employee eligible to participate in a USA Retirement Fund, 
        provided such contributions are made in a uniform manner (as 
        the same dollar amount for each such employee or the same 
        percentage of pay for each such employee) and are not intended 
        to benefit solely highly compensated employees.
            (2) Employee.--An employee may not elect (or shall not be 
        treated as having as elected) to contribute more than $15,000 
        per year to a USA Retirement Fund.
            (3) Annual indexing of amount.--The dollar amounts under

        in the form of an annuity in accordance with paragraph (2). The 
        amount of such benefits shall be dependent on the amount of 
        contributions made by the participant, the experience of the 
        Fund, and the form of distribution elected by the participant. 
        The amount of an annuity may be adjusted to reflect the 
        experience of the Fund as necessary to protect the financial 
        integrity of the Fund, except that annuity payments for those 
        in pay status shall not be reduced more than 5 percent per year 
        unless the Fund is faced with a significant financial hardship 
        and the Secretary has approved the reduction.
            (2) Annuity.--A USA Retirement Fund shall pay benefits in 
        accordance with one of the following:
                    (A) In the case of a participant who does not die 
                before the annuity starting date, the benefit payable 
                to such participant shall be provided in the form of a 
                qualified joint and survivor annuity (as defined in 
                section 205(d)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income 
                Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1055(d)(1))).
                    (B) In the case of a participant who dies before 
                the annuity starting date and who has a surviving 
                spouse, a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as 
                defined in section 205(d)(2) of the Employee Retirement 
                Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1055(d)(2))) 
                shall be provided to the surviving spouse of such 
                participant.
                    (C) In lieu of a qualified joint and survivor 
                annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement 
                survivor annuity form of benefit (or both), a 
                participant may elect to receive a distribution 
                described in subsection (f)(2) if one of the following 
                conditions are met:
                            (i)(I) The spouse of the participant 
                        consents in writing to the election.
                            (II) Such election designates a beneficiary 
                        (or form of benefits) which may not be changed 
                        without spousal consent (or the consent of the 
                        spouse expressly permits designations by the 
                        participant without any requirement of further 
                        consent by the spouse).
                            (III) The spouse's consent acknowledges the 
                        effect of such election and is witnessed by a 
                        plan representative or a notary public.
                            (ii) It is established to the satisfaction 
                        of a Fund representative that the consent 
                        required under subclause (I) cannot be obtained 
                        because there is no spouse, because the spouse 
                        cannot be located, or because of such other 
                        circumstances as the Secretary may by 
                        regulations prescribe.
                The consent of a spouse (or establishment that the 
                consent of a spouse cannot be obtained) under this 
                subparagraph shall be effective only with respect to 
                such spouse.
            (3) Commencement of benefit payments.--A participant may 
        elect the time to start receiving benefit payments from the USA 
        Retirement Fund, except that a participant--
                    (A) except as provided in subsection (f)(2)(B), may 
                not elect to receive benefit payments before reaching 
                the age of 60; and
                    (B) must begin receiving benefit payments before 
                the age of 72.
            (4) Notice.--Each Fund shall provide to each participant, 
        within a reasonable period of time before the annuity starting 
        date, a written explanation substantially similar to that 
        required by section 205(c)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income 
        Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1055(c)(3)).
            (5) Assignment or alienation of fund benefits.--Benefits 
        under a USA Retirement Fund shall be subject to section 206(d) 
        of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 
        U.S.C. 1056(d)).
    (f) Limits on Withdrawals and Transfers.--
            (1) Transfers.--A participant may, not more frequently than 
        once per year, transfer such participant's benefit to another

                participant may before age 60 take a distribution of a 
                portion of the participant's benefit if such 
                distribution does not to exceed $5,500 and is rolled 
                over to a qualifying plan or arrangement described in 
                section 219(g)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986

                greater of $10,000 or 50 percent of the participant's 
                benefit if the participant demonstrates to the 
                satisfaction of the trustees of the Fund that the 
                participant has sufficient retirement income apart from 
                the Fund or is facing a substantial hardship.
    (g) Methods for Providing Annuitized Benefit Payments.--
            (1) In general.--A USA Retirement Fund shall establish and 
        maintain mechanisms for adequately securing the payment of

        lifetime income policy statements required to be disclosed to 
        participants.
            (2) Specific goals.--The mechanisms described in paragraph

                for life;
                    (B) each participant and beneficiary has an 
                opportunity to be protected against longevity risk; and
                    (C) volatility in benefit levels is minimized for 
                participants and beneficiaries in pay status and those 
                approaching pay status.
            (3) Self-annuitization.--
                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other 
                provision of law, a USA Retirement Fund may self-
                annuitize if the Fund meets such requirements as the 
                Secretary establishes as necessary to protect 
                participants and beneficiaries in consideration of the 
                recommendations of the Commission under section 103.
                    (B) Duty to address emerging issues.--The Secretary 
                shall, periodically and in accordance with established 
                procedures, update the funding requirements promulgated 
                under this paragraph in response to changing economic 
                and business conditions to the extent necessary to 
                carry out the purposes of this Act, taking into

                which the participant or beneficiary is projected to 
                receive from the USA Retirement Fund, in the form of 
                the default benefit described in the plan in accordance 
                with subsection (e)(2);
                    (B) an explanation, written in a manner calculated 
                to be understood by the average plan participant, that 
                includes interest and mortality assumptions used in 
                calculating the estimate and a statement that actual 
                benefits may be materially different from such 
                estimate;
                    (C) a disclosure of Fund fees and performance that 
                is substantially similar to the disclosures required of 
                individual account plans under the Employee Retirement 
                Income Security Act of 1974;
                    (D) any other disclosures, including projected

                funding and distribution requirements for USA 
                Retirement Funds, as necessary or appropriate in the 
                public interest and for the protection of participants 
                and beneficiaries, including regulations described in 
                subparagraphs (B) and (C).
                    (B) Requirements relating to annuity payments made 
                directly by a fund.--The regulations under subparagraph 
                (A) shall provide that in the case of annuity payments 
                made directly by the Fund--
                            (i) the maximum annuity payment for a 
                        participant or beneficiary shall be determined 
                        using the mortality tables and interest rates 
                        prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph 
                        (C) at the time benefits commence; and
                            (ii) the level of benefits paid may be 
                        adjusted periodically in order to reflect the 
                        mortality experience and the investment 
                        experience of the Fund, but only after the Fund 
                        has obtained a certification from a member of 
                        the American Academy of Actuaries that the 
                        adjustment is sustainable for the remaining 
                        lifetime of participants then receiving 
                        benefits, based on the mortality tables and 
                        interest rates prescribed under subparagraph 
                        (C) by the Secretary for that time.
                    (C) Mortality tables and interest rates used 
                requirements.--The regulations promulgated under 
                subparagraph (A) shall include the following:
                            (i) Mortality tables.--
                                    (I) In general.--The Secretary 
                                shall prescribe mortality tables to be 
                                used in determining annuity payments 
                                made directly by the Fund. Such tables 
                                shall be based on the actual experience 
                                of insurance companies that issue group 
                                annuities and projected trends in such 
                                experience. In prescribing such tables, 
                                the Secretary shall take into account 
                                results of available independent 
                                studies of the mortality of individuals 
                                receiving annuities under group annuity 
                                contracts.
                                    (II) Periodic revisions of 
                                mortality tables.--The Secretary shall 
                                make revisions, to become effective as 
                                soon as practicable, in any mortality 
                                table in effect to reflect more recent 
                                actual experience of insurance 
                                companies that issue group annuities 
                                and projected trends in such 
                                experience. In revising such tables, 
                                the Secretary shall take into account 
                                the results of more recent available 
                                independent studies of the mortality 
                                and projected trends of individuals 
                                receiving annuities under group annuity 
                                contracts.
                            (ii) Interest rates.--The Secretary shall 
                        prescribe interest rates to be used in 
                        determining annuity payments made directly by 
                        the Fund. Such rates shall be based on the 
                        yields on investment grade corporate bonds with 
                        varying maturities and that are in the top 3 
                        quality levels available. Interest rates shall 
                        be prescribed quarterly or more frequently, as 
                        determined by the Secretary.
            (5) Duty to address best practices.--The Commission shall 
        prepare, and periodically update, a report that describes the 
        best practices for the governance of boards of trustees of USA 
        Retirement Funds, including board of trustee composition, 
        appointment procedures, term length, term staggering, trustee 
        qualifications, delegation of duties, and performance 
        assessment procedures.

SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON EMPLOYER LIABILITY.

    Section 404 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(29 U.S.C. 1021 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e) An employer shall not be a fiduciary with respect to the 
selection, management or administration of a USA Retirement Fund solely 
because such employer makes available such Fund through an automatic 
USA Retirement Fund arrangement. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, employers participating in a USA Retirement Fund shall be 
responsible for meeting the enrollment requirements and transmitting 
contributions, as required under the USA Retirement Funds Act.''.

SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT AND FRAUD PREVENTION.

USA Retirement Fund Arrangements.--
            (1) In general.--If an employer is required under an 
        automatic USA Retirement Fund arrangement to deposit amounts 
        withheld from an employee's compensation into a USA Retirement 
        Fund but fails to do so within the time prescribed under 
        section 2(d)(3), such amounts shall be treated as assets of a 
        USA Retirement Fund.
            (2) Failure to provide access to payroll savings 
        arrangements.--
                    (A) General rule.--A covered employer who fails to 
                meet the requirements of section 2(a) for a calendar 
                year shall be subject to a civil money penalty of $100 
                per calendar year for each employee to whom such 
                failure relates.
                    (B) Exceptions.--No civil money penalty shall be 
                imposed under this paragraph for a failure to meet the 
                requirements under section 2(a)--
                            (i) during a period for which the Secretary 
                        determines that the employer subject to 
                        liability for the civil money penalty did not 
                        know that the failure existed and exercised 
                        reasonable diligence to meet the requirements 
                        of section 2(a); or
                            (ii)(I) the employer subject to liability 
                        for the civil money penalty exercised 
                        reasonable diligence to meet the requirements 
                        of section 2(a); and
                            (II) the employer provides the automatic 
                        USA Retirement Fund arrangement described to 
                        each employee eligible to participate in the 
                        arrangement by the end of the 90-day period 
                        beginning on the first date the employer knew, 
                        or exercising reasonable diligence should have 
                        known, that such failure existed.
                    (C) Waiver by the secretary.--In the case of a 
                failure to meet the requirements of section 2(a) that 
                is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, 
                the Secretary may, in the sole discretion of the 
                Secretary, waive part or all of the civil money penalty 
                imposed under this paragraph to the extent that the 
                payment of such civil money penalty would be excessive 
                or otherwise inequitable relative to the failure 
                involved.
                    (D) Procedures for notice.--The Secretary may 
                prescribe and implement procedures for obtaining 
                confirmation that employers are in compliance with 
                subsection (a). The Secretary, in the discretion of 
                such Secretary, may prescribe that the confirmation 
                shall be obtained on an annual or less frequent basis, 
                and may use for this purpose the annual report or 
                quarterly report for employment taxes, or such other 
                means as the Secretary may deem advisable.
    (b) Civil Actions and Enforcement.--
            (1) Administration and enforcement.--Part 5 of title I of 
        the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 
        1132 et seq.) shall apply to a USA Retirement Fund as if a USA 
        Retirement Fund were an employee benefit plan.
            (2) Amendment.--Section 502(a) of the Employee Retirement 
        Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1132 et seq.) is 
        amended--
                    (A) in paragraph (9), by striking ``; or'' and 
                inserting ``;'';
                    (B) in paragraph (10), by striking the period at 
                the end and inserting ``; or''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(11) in the event that an employer fails to make timely 
        contributions or payments to a USA Retirement Fund established 
        under title I of the USA Retirement Funds Act, by the 
        Secretary, a participant, a beneficiary, or a fiduciary, to 
        compel an employer to make such contributions or payments as if 
        such contributions or payments were delinquent contributions or 
        payments under section 515 or subsection (g)(2).''.
            (3) Non-preemption of certain state law.--Nothing in this 
        section shall preempt State law insofar as State law relates to 
        the enforcement of an obligation to contribute to a USA 
        Retirement Fund.
    (c) False Statements.--
            (1) In general.--No person, in connection with a plan or 
        other arrangement that is or purports to be a USA Retirement 
        Fund, shall make a false statement or false representation of 
        fact, knowing it to be false, in connection with the marketing 
        or sale of such plan or arrangement, to any employee, any 
        member of an employee organization, any beneficiary, any 
        employer, any employee organization, the Secretary, or any 
        State, or the representative or agent of any such person, 
        State, or the Secretary, concerning--
                    (A) the financial condition or solvency of such 
                fund or arrangement;
                    (B) the benefits provided by such fund or 
                arrangement;
                    (C) the regulatory status of such fund or other 
                arrangement under any Federal or State law governing 
                collective bargaining, labor management relations, or 
                intern union affairs; or
                    (D) the regulatory status of such fund or other 
                arrangement.
            (2) Penalty.--Any person who violates this subsection 
        shall, upon conviction, be imprisoned not more than 10 years or 
        fined under title 18, United States Code, or both.
    (d) Cease and Desist Orders.--
            (1) Issuance of order.--The Secretary may issue a cease and 
        desist (ex parte) order under this title if the Secretary 
        determines that the alleged conduct of a fund purporting to be 
        a USA Retirement Fund is fraudulent, or creates an immediate 
        danger to the public safety or welfare, or is causing or can be 
        reasonably expected to cause significant, imminent, and 
        irreparable public injury.
            (2) Hearings.--
                    (A) In general.--A person who is adversely affected 
                by the issuance of a cease and desist order under 
                paragraph (1) may request a hearing by the Secretary 
                regarding such order. The Secretary may require that a 
                hearing under this paragraph, including all related 
                information and evidence, be conducted in a 
                confidential manner.
                    (B) Burden of proof.--The burden of proof in any 
                hearing conducted under subparagraph (A) shall be on 
                the party requesting the hearing to show cause why the 
                cease and desist order should be set aside.
                    (C) Determination.--Based upon the evidence 
                presented at a hearing under subparagraph (A), the 
                Secretary may affirm, modify, or set aside the cease 
                and desist order at issue, in whole or in part.
            (3) Regulations.--The Secretary may promulgate such 
        regulations or other guidance as may be necessary or 
        appropriate to carry out this subsection.
