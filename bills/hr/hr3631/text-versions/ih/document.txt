            (1) in subsection (b)(1)(B), by inserting ``, except as

                person that owns a generic drug facility a waiver from 
                or a reduction of one or more fees assessed to that 
                person under subsection (a) where the Secretary finds 
                that the assessment of the fee would present a 
                significant barrier to market entry because of limited 
                resources available to such person or other 
                circumstances.
                    ``(B) Considerations.--In determining whether to 
                grant a waiver or reduction of a fee under subparagraph 
                (A), the Secretary shall consider only the 
                circumstances and assets of the person involved and any 
                affiliate of the person.
                    ``(C) Written requests.--To qualify for 
                consideration for a waiver or reduction under 
                subparagraph (A), a person shall submit to the 
                Secretary a written request for such waiver or 
                reduction not later than 180 days after the fee is due.
                    ``(D) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term 
                `person that owns a generic drug facility' means a 
                person that owns a facility which is identified or 
                intended to be identified in at least one generic drug 
                submission that is pending or approved to produce one 
                or more finished dosage forms of a human generic 
                drug.''.
    (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section apply with 
respect to fees authorized to be assessed and collected for any of
