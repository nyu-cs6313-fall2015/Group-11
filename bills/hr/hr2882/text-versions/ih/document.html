            (1) in paragraph (2), to read as follows:
            ``(2) Small business concern owned and controlled by 
        service-disabled veterans.--The term `small business concern 
        owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans' means a 
        small business concern--
                    ``(A)(i) not less than 51 percent of which is owned 
                by one or more service-disabled veterans or, in the 
                case of any publicly owned business, not less than 51 
                percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more 
                service-disabled veterans; and
                    ``(ii) the management and daily business operations 
                of which are controlled by one or more service-disabled 
                veterans or, in the case of a veteran with permanent 
                and severe disability, the spouse or permanent 
                caregiver of such veteran; or
                    ``(B) not less than 51 percent of which is owned by 
                one or more veterans with service-connected 
                disabilities that are permanent and total who are 
                unable to manage the daily business operations of such 
                concern or, in the case of a publicly owned business, 
                not less than 51 percent of the stock of which is owned 
                by one or more such veterans.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(6) Treatment of businesses after death of veteran-
        owner.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (C), if 
                the death of a service-disabled veteran causes a small 
                business concern to be less than 51 percent owned by 
                one or more such veterans, the surviving spouse of such 
                veteran who acquires ownership rights in such small 
                business concern shall, for the period described in 
                subparagraph (B), be treated as if the surviving spouse 
                were that veteran for the purpose of maintaining the 
                status of the small business concern as a small 
                business concern owned and controlled by service-
                disabled veterans.
                    ``(B) Period described.--The period referred to in 
                subparagraph (A) is the period beginning on the date on 
                which the service-disabled veteran dies and ending on 
                the earliest of the following dates:
                            ``(i) The date on which the surviving 
                        spouse remarries.
                            ``(ii) The date on which the surviving 
                        spouse relinquishes an ownership interest in 
                        the small business concern.
                            ``(iii) The date that is ten years after 
                        the date of the veteran's death.
                    ``(C) Application to surviving spouse.--
                Subparagraph (A) only applies to a surviving spouse of 
                a veteran with a service-connected disability rated as 
                100 percent disabling or who dies as a result of a 
                service-connected disability.''.
