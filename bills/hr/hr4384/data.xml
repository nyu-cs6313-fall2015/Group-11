  <summary>4/3/2014--Introduced.
America Helping Encourage Advancements in Lifesaving Science or the America HEALS Act - Establishes a Biomedical Research Fund to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for an expanded and sustained national investment in biomedical research.

Requires amounts to be transferred from the Fund for each fiscal year to accounts related to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of Defense (DOD) health program, and the medical and prosthetics research program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to ensure that funding for such programs and agencies does not fall below 105% of the level of funding provided for the preceding fiscal year and an additional amount to account for any increases in the Gross Domestic Product for the year involved.

Requires that amounts appropriated for each of such programs and agencies for a fiscal year be not be less than the amounts appropriated for FY2014. Authorizes and appropriates to the Fund such sums as necessary in each fiscal year to enable such transfers.

Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act to exempt the Fund from any sequestration order issued under such Act.</summary>
