                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 18, United States Code, to require the Bureau of Prisons 
  to provide secure storage areas on institution grounds outside the 
     secure perimeter for employees authorized to carry a firearm.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Correctional Workers Safety 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

            (1) The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, enacted in 
        2004 and later amended by the Law Enforcement Officers Safety 
        Act Improvements Act of 2010, gives law enforcement officers, 
        including Bureau of Prisons (BOP) employees, the right to carry 
        a concealed firearm in all fifty States for self-protection.
            (2) The intent of the law is to allow law enforcement 
        officers to protect themselves while off duty.
            (3) Correctional workers in the BOP have been the targets 
        of assaults and murders while off duty.
            (4) While this law allows officers to protect themselves 
        off duty, the BOP does not allow staff to carry their personal 
        weapon on the grounds of most facilities when commuting to and 
        from work.
            (5) The BOP allows carry to and from work and storage at 
        approximately 15 facilities in the BOP, but they do not 
        reasonably explain why they allow some BOP staff to carry on 
        BOP property while others are not allowed.

SEC. 3. SECURE FIREARMS STORAGE IN PRISON.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 303 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

prison facility provides a secure firearms storage area for use by all 
persons employed by the Bureau at the facility who are authorized to 
carry a firearm, or allow employees authorized to carry a firearm to 
store their firearm in a Bureau-approved vehicle lockbox.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
chapter 303 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at
