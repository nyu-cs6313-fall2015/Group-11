                                 A BILL


 
   Making supplemental appropriations for the National Institutes of 
  Health for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Research First Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) In fiscal year 2013, the budget of the National 
        Institutes of Health was decreased by approximately $1.55 
        billion pursuant to section 251A of the Balanced Budget and 
        Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901a).
            (2) The National Institutes of Health is the true 
        Department of Defense for the citizens of the United States, 
        conducting vital research to fight the enemy of disease and 
        protect the infrastructure of the human body. Such research 
        funding should not be slashed while the Pentagon budget 
        continues to increase.
            (3) The national security interests of the United States 
        can be well served by reducing the total number of deployed 
        nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, as suggested by 
        the Department of Defense's January 2012 strategic guidance 
        titled ``Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st 
        Century Defense''.
            (4) The Government Accountability Office has found that 
        there is significant waste in the construction of the nuclear 
        facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration of 
        the Department of Energy. Significant savings can also be found 
        by reducing expenditures on weapons which the military has not 
        requested such as the Abrams Tank, bringing military and 
        infrastructure operations in Afghanistan to a close, and 
        decreasing the Nation's reliance on expensive, private 
        contractors.

SEC. 3. SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF 
              HEALTH.

    There is appropriated to the National Institute of Health, for an 
additional amount for the purpose of carrying out title IV of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 281 et seq.), $1,550,000,000, out 
of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for fiscal 
year 2013.

SEC. 4. RESCISSIONS.

    Of the unobligated balances of the following accounts, the 
following amounts are rescinded:
            (1) ``Department of Defense--Overseas Contingency 
        Operations--Operation and Maintenance--Afghanistan 
        Infrastructure Fund'', $400,000,000.
            (2) ``Department of Defense'', $1,150,000,000.
                                 <all>
