    ``(a) In General.--Purchases from Federal Prison Industries, 
Incorporated, a wholly owned Government corporation, as referred to in 
section 9101(3)(E) of title 31, may be made by a Federal department or 
agency only in accordance with this section.

(1)(A) If a procurement activity of a Federal department or agency has 
a requirement for a specific product or service that is authorized to 
be offered for sale by Federal Prison Industries, in accordance with 
section 4122 of this title, and is listed in the catalog referred to in 
subsection (g), the procurement activity shall solicit an offer from 
Federal Prison Industries, if the purchase is expected to be in excess 
of the micro-purchase threshold (as defined by section 32(f) of the 
Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 428(f))).
    ``(B) The requirements of subparagraph (A) shall also apply to a

on any Schedule, referred to in subparagraph (B), as offering products

to those products and services being offered by commercial contractors 
through the Multiple Award Schedule Contracts Program.
    ``(2) A contract award for such product or service shall be made

General pursuant to paragraph (3) or an award using other than 
competitive procedures is authorized pursuant to paragraph (7).

        competitive basis; and
            ``(B) the contract award is necessary to maintain work 
        opportunities otherwise unavailable at the penal or 
        correctional facility at which the contract is to be performed 
        to prevent circumstances that could reasonably be expected to 
        significantly endanger the safe and effective administration of 
        such facility.
    ``(4) Except in the case of an award to be made pursuant to 
paragraph (3), a contract award shall be made with Federal Prison 
Industries only if the contracting officer for the procurement activity

        price.
    ``(5) A determination by the Attorney General pursuant to paragraph

        penal or correctional institution at which a Federal Prison 
        Industries workshop is scheduled to perform the contract;

procurement activity, the procurement activity may proceed to conduct a 
procurement for the product or service in accordance with the 
procedures generally applicable to such procurements by the procurement 
activity.

specific service, in conformance with the requirements of paragraphs 
(5) through (9).
    ``(B) Federal Prison Industries may produce a product or furnish a 
service in excess of the authorized level of production for such 
product or service, in response to an order placed pursuant to an 
existing contract with a Federal department or agency, if the agency's 
need for the product or service is of such an urgency that it would 
justify the use of procedures other than competitive procedures 
pursuant to section 2304(c)(2) of title 10 or section 303(c)(2) of the 
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C.

such team shall be led by the Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration or the designee of such officer with representatives of 
the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, and the Federal

    ``(iii) If the analysis is to be performed by a private contractor, 
the selection of the contractor and the administration of the contract 
shall be conducted by one of the entities referenced in clause (ii) as 
an independent executive agent for the board of directors. Maximum 
consideration shall be given to any proposed statement of work 
furnished by the Chief Operating Officer of Federal Prison Industries.

        performance will commence or expand and the subsequent 4 fiscal 
        years;

        or specific service in the private sector--

        Federal Government for the specific product or service to 
        sustain both Federal Prison Industries and private vendors; and

                inmate worker in an unauthorized work activity, the

                rehabilitative opportunities designed to prepare each 
                inmate for a successful return to society and reduce 
                recidivism. The demonstration program shall be 
                undertaken by a contractor with a demonstrated record 
                of enabling the behavioral and academic improvement of 
                adults through the use of research-based systems that 
                maximize the development of both the cognitive and

                        institutions; and
                            (iii) offered to 6,000 inmates, who are 
                        categorized as minimum security or less, and 
                        are within five years of release.
                    (C) Report on results of program.--Not later than 
                60 days after completion of the demonstration program, 
                the Director shall submit to Congress a report on the 
                results of the program. At a minimum, the report shall 
                include an analysis of employment stability, stability 
                of residence, and rates of recidivism among inmates who 
                participated in the program after 18 months of release.
            (2) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized 
        to be appropriated $3,000,000 in each of the three fiscal years 
        after fiscal year 2013, to remain available until expended, for 
        the purposes of conducting the demonstration program authorized 
        by subsection (a).
    (e) Prerelease Employment Assistance.--
            (1) In general.--The Director of the Federal Bureau of 
        Prisons shall, to the maximum extent practicable, afford to 
        inmates opportunities to participate in programs and activities 
        designed to help prepare such inmates to obtain employment upon 
        release.

        prerelease employment placement assistance required by 
        subsection (a) shall include--
                    (A) training in the preparation of resumes and job
