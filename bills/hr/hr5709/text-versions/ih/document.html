_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To terminate the authority to waive certain provisions of law requiring 
  the imposition of sanctions with respect to Iran, to codify certain 
     sanctions imposed by executive order, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sanction Iran, Safeguard America Act 
of 2014'' or the ``SISA Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A nuclear-capable Iran poses a direct and existential 
        threat to the United States, Israel, and allies around the 
        world.
            (2) Iran is a leading state sponsor of terrorism, arming 
        and funding terrorist groups around the world, including by 
        providing material support for the terrorist organization Hamas 
        in its relentless attacks on Israel.
            (3) The Government of Iran has violated United Nations 
        Security Council Resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 
        (2007), 1803 (2008), 1835 (2008), and 1929 (2010), relating to 
        Iran's nuclear program.
            (4) The Government of Iran has received significant 
        economic benefits from the relaxation of economic sanctions 
        pursuant the Joint Plan of Action, signed November 24, 2013, by 
        Iran and by France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the 
        People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and the United 
        States (in this section referred to as the ``Joint Plan of 
        Action''), including increased economic growth, reduced 
        inflation, and a strengthened currency, while making no 
        substantive reductions in its nuclear program.
            (5) Any deal relating to Iran's nuclear weapons program 
        that does not completely dismantle the entire nuclear weapons 
        program would repeat the same mistakes observed with 
        negotiations with North Korea, a totalitarian country that 
        exported its nuclear technology to Syria and has shared similar 
        nuclear and ballistic missile technology with Iran.
            (6) The Agreed Framework between the United States and the 
        Democratic People's Republic of Korea, signed in Geneva on 
        October 21, 1994, which called for North Korea to freeze and 
        dismantle its nuclear weapons program in exchange for eased 
        sanctions and normalized relations with the United States, 
        should serve as a reminder of previous failed negotiations 
        resulting in billions of dollars made available for the 
        development of nuclear weapons.
            (7) Economic sanctions imposed with respect to Iran are 
        designed for the purpose of ending Iran's pursuit of a nuclear 
        weapons capability, not of initiating negotiations. Therefore, 
        any easing of sanctions in pursuit of negotiations undermines 
        the purpose of the sanctions, as is demonstrated by the case of 
        North Korea.

SEC. 3. MODIFICATION AND ELIMINATION OF WAIVER AUTHORITIES FOR CERTAIN
