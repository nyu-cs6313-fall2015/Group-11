expenses recoverable against any interested party joined pursuant to

        time of a civil action arising under any Act of Congress 
        relating to patents will necessarily affect the rights of a 
        party with respect to the patent, the court may permit 
        discovery, in addition to the discovery authorized under

``Sec. 296. Stay of action against customer
    ``(a) Stay of Action Against Customer.--Except as provided in 
subsection (d), in any civil action arising under any Act of Congress 
relating to patents, the court shall grant a motion to stay at least 
the portion of the action against a covered customer related to 
infringement of a patent involving a covered product or process if the 
following requirements are met:
            ``(1) The covered manufacturer and the covered customer 
        consent in writing to the stay.
            ``(2) The covered manufacturer is a party to the action or 
        to a separate action involving the same patent or patents 
        related to the same covered product or process.
            ``(3) The covered customer agrees to be bound by any 
        judgment entered against the covered manufacturer to the same 
        extent that the covered manufacturer may be bound with respect 
        to issues that the covered manufacturer and the covered 
        customer have in common.
            ``(4) The motion is filed after the first pleading in the 
        action and not later than 120 days after service of the first 
        pleading in the action that specifically identifies--
                    ``(A) the covered product or process as a basis for 
                the alleged infringement of the patent by the covered 
                customer; and
                    ``(B) how the covered product or process is alleged 
                to infringe the patent.
    ``(b) Applicability of Stay.--A stay issued pursuant to subsection 
(a) shall apply only to the patents, products, systems, or components 
accused of infringement in the action.
    ``(c) Lift of Stay.--
            ``(1) In general.--A stay entered pursuant to this section 
        may be lifted upon grant of a motion based on a showing that--
                    ``(A) the action involving the covered manufacturer 
                will not resolve a major issue in suit against the 
                covered customer; or
                    ``(B) the stay unreasonably prejudices and would be 
                manifestly unjust to the party seeking to lift the 
                stay.
            ``(2) Separate manufacturer action involved.--In the case 
        of a stay entered based on the participation of the covered 
        manufacturer in a separate action involving the same patent or 
        patents related to the same covered product or process, a 
        motion under this subsection may only be made if the court in 
        such separate action determines the showing required under 
        paragraph (1) has been met.
    ``(d) Exemption.--This section shall not apply to an action that 
includes a cause of action described under section 271(e).

construed to limit the ability of a court to grant any stay, or expand 
any stay granted pursuant to this section, if otherwise permitted by 
law.

SEC. 6. PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO 
              THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE.

    (a) Judicial Conference Rules and Procedures on Discovery Burdens 
and Costs.--
            (1) Rules and procedures.--The Judicial Conference of the 
        United States, using existing resources, shall develop rules 
        and procedures to implement the requirements described in 
        paragraph (2) to address the asymmetries in discovery burdens 
        and costs in any civil action arising under any Act of Congress 
        relating to patents. Such rules and procedures shall include 
        how and when payment for document discovery in addition to the 
        discovery of core documentary evidence is to occur, and what 
        information must be presented to demonstrate financial capacity 
        before permitting document discovery in addition to the 
        discovery of core documentary evidence.
            (2) Rules and procedures to be considered.--The rules and 
        procedures required under paragraph (1) shall include each of 
        the following requirements:
                    (A) Discovery of core documentary evidence.--Each 
                party to the action is entitled to receive core 
                documentary evidence and shall be responsible for the 
                costs of producing core documentary evidence within the 
                possession or control of each such party. Each party to 
                the action may seek nondocumentary discovery as 
                otherwise provided in the Federal Rules of Civil 
                Procedure.
                    (B) Electronic communication.--If the parties 
                determine that the discovery of electronic 
                communication is necessary, such discovery shall occur 
                after the parties have exchanged initial disclosures 
                and core documentary evidence and shall be in 
                accordance with the following:
                            (i) Any request for the production of 
                        electronic communication shall be specific and 
                        may not be a general request for the production 
                        of information relating to a product or 
                        business.
                            (ii) Each request shall identify the 
                        custodian of the information requested, the 
                        search terms, and a time frame. The parties 
                        shall cooperate to identify the proper 
                        custodians, the proper search terms, and the 
                        proper time frame.
                            (iii) A party may not submit production 
                        requests to more than 5 custodians, unless the 
                        parties jointly agree to modify the number of 
                        production requests without leave of the court.
                            (iv) The court may consider contested 
                        requests for up to 5 additional custodians per 
                        producing party, upon a showing of a distinct 
                        need based on the size, complexity, and issues 
                        of the case.
                            (v) If a party requests the discovery of 
                        electronic communication for additional 
                        custodians beyond the limits agreed to by the 
                        parties or granted by the court, the requesting 
                        party shall bear all reasonable costs caused by 
                        such additional discovery.
                    (C) Additional document discovery.--
                            (i) In general.--Each party to the action 
                        may seek any additional document discovery 
                        otherwise permitted under the Federal Rules of 
                        Civil Procedure, if such party bears the 
                        reasonable costs, including reasonable 
                        attorney's fees, of the additional document 
                        discovery.
                            (ii) Requirements for additional document 
                        discovery.--Unless the parties mutually agree 
                        otherwise, no party may be permitted additional 
                        document discovery unless such a party posts a 
                        bond, or provides other security, in an amount 
                        sufficient to cover the expected costs of such 
                        additional document discovery, or makes a 
                        showing to the court that such party has the 
                        financial capacity to pay the costs of such 
                        additional document discovery.
                            (iii) Limits on additional document 
                        discovery.--A court, upon motion, may determine 
                        that a request for additional document 
                        discovery is excessive, irrelevant, or 
                        otherwise abusive and may set limits on such 
                        additional document discovery.
                            (iv) Good cause modification.--A court, 
                        upon motion and for good cause shown, may 
                        modify the requirements of subparagraphs (A) 
                        and (B) and any definition under paragraph (3). 
                        Not later than 30 days after the pretrial 
                        conference under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules 
                        of Civil Procedure, the parties shall jointly 
                        submit any proposed modifications of the 
                        requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) and 
                        any definition under paragraph (3), unless the 
                        parties do not agree, in which case each party 
                        shall submit any proposed modification of such 
                        party and a summary of the disagreement over 
                        the modification.
                            (v) Computer code.--A court, upon motion 
                        and for good cause shown, may determine that 
                        computer code should be included in the 
                        discovery of core documentary evidence. The 
                        discovery of computer code shall occur after 
                        the parties have exchanged initial disclosures 
                        and other core documentary evidence.
                    (D) Discovery sequence and scope.--The parties 
                shall discuss and address in the written report filed 
                pursuant to Rule 26(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil 
                Procedure the views and proposals of each party on the 
                following:
                            (i) When the discovery of core documentary 
                        evidence should be completed.
                            (ii) Whether additional document discovery 
                        will be sought under subparagraph (C).
                            (iii) Any issues about infringement, 
                        invalidity, or damages that, if resolved before 
                        the additional discovery described in 
                        subparagraph (C) commences, might simplify or 
                        streamline the case, including the 
                        identification of any terms or phrases relating 
                        to any patent claim at issue to be construed by 
                        the court and whether the early construction of 
                        any of those terms or phrases would be helpful.
            (3) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                    (A) Core documentary evidence.--In this subsection, 
                the term ``core documentary evidence''--

                                conception of, reduction to practice 
                                of, and application for, the patent or 
                                patents at issue;

                                or process identified in the complaint 
                                as infringing the patent or patents at 
                                issue;
                                    (III) documents relating to

                                issue before the date on which the 
                                complaint is filed;
                                    (V) documents sufficient to show 
                                profit attributable to the claimed 
                                invention of the patent or patents at

                                the date on which the complaint is 
                                filed;

                                at issue before the date on which the 
                                complaint is filed;
                                    (VIII) documents relating to any

                                subject through any agency or standard-
                                setting body; and
                                    (IX) documents sufficient to show 
                                any marking or other notice provided of

                        as specified in paragraph (2)(C)(v).
                    (B) Electronic communication.--The term 
                ``electronic communication'' means any form of 
                electronic communication, including email, text 
                message, or instant message.

        6 months after the date on which the Judicial Conference has 
        developed the rules and procedures required by this subsection,

        of Federal Claims shall revise the applicable local rules for 
        such court to implement such rules and procedures.
            (5) Authority for judicial conference to review and 
        modify.--The Judicial Conference shall study the efficacy of 
        the rules and procedures required by this subsection during the 
        first 4 years following the implementation of such rules and

        of Federal Claims. The Judicial Conference may modify such 
        rules and procedures following such 4-year period.
    (b) Judicial Conference Patent Case Management.--The Judicial 
Conference of the United States, using existing resources, shall 
develop case management procedures to be implemented by the United 
States district courts and the United States Court of Federal Claims 
for any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to 
patents, including initial disclosure and early case management 
conference practices that--
            (1) will identify any potential dispositive issues of the 
        case; and
            (2) focus on early summary judgment motions when resolution

            (2) Revised form.--The Supreme Court may prescribe a new 
        form or forms setting out model allegations of patent 
        infringement that, at a minimum, notify accused infringers of 
        the asserted claim or claims, the products or services accused 
        of infringement, and the plaintiff's theory for how each 
        accused product or service meets each limitation of each 
        asserted claim. The Judicial Conference should exercise the 
        authority under section 2073 of title 28, United States Code,
