        Code, is amended to read as follows:

    ``(a) Award.--The court shall award, to a prevailing party, 
reasonable fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection 
with a civil action in which any party asserts a claim for relief 
arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, unless the court 
finds that the position and conduct of the nonprevailing party or 
parties were reasonably justified in law and fact or that special 
circumstances (such as severe economic hardship to a named inventor) 
make an award unjust.
    ``(b) Certification and Recovery.--Upon motion of any party to the 
action, the court shall require another party to the action to certify 
whether or not the other party will be able to pay an award of fees and 
other expenses if such an award is made under subsection (a). If a 
nonprevailing party is unable to pay an award that is made against it 
under subsection (a), the court may make a party that has been joined 
under section 299(d) with respect to such party liable for the 
unsatisfied portion of the award.
    ``(c) Covenant Not to Sue.--A party to a civil action that asserts 
a claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to 
patents against another party, and that subsequently unilaterally 
extends to such other party a covenant not to sue for infringement with 
respect to the patent or patents at issue, shall be deemed to be a 
nonprevailing party (and the other party the prevailing party) for 
purposes of this section, unless the party asserting such claim would 
have been entitled, at the time that such covenant was extended, to 
voluntarily dismiss the action or claim without a court order under 
Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.''.
            (2) Conforming amendment and amendment.--
                    (A) Conforming amendment.--The item relating to 
                section 285 of the table of sections for chapter 29 of 
                title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as 
                follows:

        ``285. Fees and other expenses.''.
                    (B) Amendment.--Section 273 of title 35, United 
                States Code, is amended by striking subsections (f) and 
                (g).
            (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by this subsection 
        shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and 
        shall apply to any action for which a complaint is filed on or 
        after the first day of the 6-month period ending on that 
        effective date.
    (c) Joinder of Interested Parties.--Section 299 of title 35, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subsection:
    ``(d) Joinder of Interested Parties.--
            ``(1) Joinder.--In a civil action arising under any Act of 
        Congress relating to patents in which fees and other expenses 
        have been awarded under section 285 to a prevailing party 
        defending against an allegation of infringement of a patent 
        claim, and in which the nonprevailing party alleging 
        infringement is unable to pay the award of fees and other 
        expenses, the court shall grant a motion by the prevailing 
        party to join an interested party if such prevailing party 
        shows that the nonprevailing party has no substantial interest 
        in the subject matter at issue other than asserting such patent 
        claim in litigation.
            ``(2) Limitation on joinder.--
                    ``(A) Discretionary denial of motion.--The court 
                may deny a motion to join an interested party under 
                paragraph (1) if--
                            ``(i) the interested party is not subject 
                        to service of process; or
                            ``(ii) joinder under paragraph (1) would 
                        deprive the court of subject matter 
                        jurisdiction or make venue improper.

                deny a motion to join an interested party under

        notice, within 30 days after the date on which it has been

        290(b), that it has been so identified and that such party may 
        therefore be an interested party subject to joinder under this 
        subsection. Such notice shall be provided by the party who 
        subsequently moves to join the interested party under paragraph

                            ``(iv) the party receiving notice under 
                        this paragraph has not, within 30 days after 
                        receiving such notice, renounced in writing,

                        financial interest (as described in paragraph 
                        (4)) that the interested party has in the 
                        patent or patents at issue.
            ``(4) Interested party defined.--In this subsection, the 
        term `interested party' means a person, other than the party 
        alleging infringement, that--
                    ``(A) is an assignee of the patent or patents at 
                issue;
                    ``(B) has a right, including a contingent right, to 
                enforce or sublicense the patent or patents at issue;

                except that a person with a direct financial interest 
                does not include--

                        legal representation in the civil action 
                        described in paragraph (1) if the sole basis 
                        for the financial interest of the attorney or 
                        law firm in the patent or patents at issue 
                        arises from the attorney or law firm's receipt 
                        of compensation reasonably related to the 
                        provision of the legal representation; or

                        alleging infringement, unless such person also 
                        has the right or ability to influence, direct, 
                        or control the civil action.''.
    (d) Discovery Limits.--
            (1) Amendment.--Chapter 29 of title 35, United States Code, 
        is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 299A. Discovery in patent infringement action
    ``(a) Discovery in Patent Infringement Action.--Except as provided 
in subsections (b) and (c), in a civil action arising under any Act of 
Congress relating to patents, if the court determines that a ruling 
relating to the construction of terms used in a patent claim asserted 
in the complaint is required, discovery shall be limited, until such 
ruling is issued, to information necessary for the court to determine 
the meaning of the terms used in the patent claim, including any 
interpretation of those terms used to support the claim of 
infringement.
    ``(b) Discretion To Expand Scope of Discovery.--
            ``(1) Timely resolution of actions.--In the case of an 
        action under any provision of Federal law (including an action 
        that includes a claim for relief arising under section 271(e)), 
        for which resolution within a specified period of time of a 
        civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to 
        patents will necessarily affect the rights of a party with 
        respect to the patent, the court shall permit discovery, in 
        addition to the discovery authorized under subsection (a), 
        before the ruling described in subsection (a) is issued as 
        necessary to ensure timely resolution of the action.
            ``(2) Resolution of motions.--When necessary to resolve a 
        motion properly raised by a party before a ruling relating to 
        the construction of terms described in subsection (a) is 
        issued, the court may allow limited discovery in addition to 
        the discovery authorized under subsection (a) as necessary to 
        resolve the motion.
            ``(3) Special circumstances.--In special circumstances that 
        would make denial of discovery a manifest injustice, the court 
        may permit discovery, in addition to the discovery authorized 
        under subsection (a), as necessary to prevent the manifest 
        injustice.
            ``(4) Actions seeking relief based on competitive harm.--
        The limitation on discovery provided under subsection (a) shall 
        not apply to an action seeking a preliminary injunction to 
        redress harm arising from the use, sale, or offer for sale of 
        any allegedly infringing instrumentality that competes with a 
        product sold or offered for sale, or a process used in 
        manufacture, by a party alleging infringement.
    ``(c) Exclusion From Discovery Limitation.--The parties may 
voluntarily consent to be excluded, in whole or in part, from the 
limitation on discovery provided under subsection (a) if at least one 
plaintiff and one defendant enter into a signed stipulation, to be 
filed with and signed by the court. With regard to any discovery 
excluded from the requirements of subsection (a) under the signed 
stipulation, with respect to such parties, such discovery shall proceed 
according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.''.
            (2) Conforming amendment.--The table of sections for 
        chapter 29 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by 
        adding at the end the following new item:

        ``299A. Discovery in patent infringement action.''.
    (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it is an 
abuse of the patent system and against public policy for a party to 
send out purposely evasive demand letters to end users alleging patent 
infringement. Demand letters sent should, at the least, include basic 
information about the patent in question, what is being infringed, and 
how it is being infringed. Any actions or litigation that stem from 
these types of purposely evasive demand letters to end users should be 
considered a fraudulent or deceptive practice and an exceptional 
circumstance when considering whether the litigation is abusive.
    (f) Demand Letters.--Section 284 of title 35, United States Code, 
is amended--
            (1) in the first undesignated paragraph, by striking ``Upon 
        finding'' and inserting ``(a) In General.--Upon finding'';
            (2) in the second undesignated paragraph, by striking 
        ``When the damages'' and inserting ``(b) Assessment by Court; 
        Treble Damages.--When the damages'';
            (3) by inserting after subsection (b), as designated by 
        paragraph (2) of this subsection, the following:
    ``(c) Willful Infringement.--A claimant seeking to establish 
willful infringement may not rely on evidence of pre-suit notification 
of infringement unless that notification identifies with particularity 
the asserted patent, identifies the product or process accused, 
identifies the ultimate parent entity of the claimant, and explains 
with particularity, to the extent possible following a reasonable 
investigation or inquiry, how the product or process infringes one or 
more claims of the patent.''; and
            (4) in the last undesignated paragraph, by striking ``The 
        court'' and inserting ``(d) Expert Testimony.--The court''.
    (g) Effective Date.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, 
the amendments made by this section shall take effect on the date of 
the enactment of this Act and shall apply to any action for which a 
complaint is filed on or after that date.

SEC. 4. TRANSPARENCY OF PATENT OWNERSHIP.

    (a) Amendments.--Section 290 of title 35, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) in the heading, by striking ``suits'' and inserting 
        ``suits; disclosure of interests'';
            (2) by striking ``The clerks'' and inserting ``(a) Notice 
        of Patent Suits.--The clerks''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new subsections:
    ``(b) Initial Disclosure.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), 
        upon the filing of an initial complaint for patent 
        infringement, the plaintiff shall disclose to the Patent and 
        Trademark Office, the court, and each adverse party the 
        identity of each of the following:
                    ``(A) The assignee of the patent or patents at 
                issue.
                    ``(B) Any entity with a right to sublicense or 
                enforce the patent or patents at issue.
                    ``(C) Any entity, other than the plaintiff, that 
                the plaintiff knows to have a financial interest in the 
                patent or patents at issue or the plaintiff.
                    ``(D) The ultimate parent entity of any assignee 
                identified under subparagraph (A) and any entity

amended to read as follows:
``Sec. 296. Stay of action against customer
    ``(a) Stay of Action Against Customer.--Except as provided in 
subsection (d), in any civil action arising under any Act of Congress 
relating to patents, the court shall grant a motion to stay at least 
the portion of the action against a covered customer related to 
infringement of a patent involving a covered product or process if the 
following requirements are met:
            ``(1) The covered manufacturer and the covered customer 
        consent in writing to the stay.
            ``(2) The covered manufacturer is a party to the action or 
        to a separate action involving the same patent or patents 
        related to the same covered product or process.

        that the covered customer has in common with the covered 
        manufacturer and are finally decided as to the covered 
        manufacturer in an action described in paragraph (2).
            ``(4) The motion is filed after the first pleading in the 
        action but not later than the later of--
                    ``(A) the 120th day after the date on which the 
                first pleading in the action is served that

                as a basis for the covered customer's alleged 
                infringement of the patent and that specifically 
                identifies how the covered product or process is 
                alleged to infringe the patent; or
                    ``(B) the date on which the first scheduling order 
                in the case is entered.

shall apply only to the patents, products, systems, or components 
accused of infringement in the action.
    ``(c) Lift of Stay.--
            ``(1) In general.--A stay entered under this section may be 
        lifted upon grant of a motion based on a showing that--
                    ``(A) the action involving the covered manufacturer 
                will not resolve a major issue in suit against the 
                covered customer; or

        of a stay entered based on the participation of the covered 
        manufacturer in a separate action involving the same patent or 
        patents related to the same covered product or process, a 
        motion under this subsection may only be made if the court in 
        such separate action determines the showing required under 
        paragraph (1) has been met.
    ``(d) Exemption.--This section shall not apply to an action that 
includes a cause of action described under section 271(e)(2).
    ``(e) Consent Judgment.--If, following the grant of a motion to 
stay under this section, the covered manufacturer seeks or consents to 
entry of a consent judgment relating to one or more of the common 
issues that gave rise to the stay, or declines to prosecute through 
appeal a final decision as to one or more of the common issues that 
gave rise to the stay, the court may, upon grant of a motion, determine 
that such consent judgment or unappealed final decision shall not be 
binding on the covered customer with respect to one or more of such 
common issues based on a showing that such an outcome would 
unreasonably prejudice and be manifestly unjust to the covered customer 
in light of the circumstances of the case.
    ``(f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to limit the ability of a court to grant any stay, expand any 
stay granted under this section, or grant any motion to intervene, if 
otherwise permitted by law.

            ``(1) Covered customer.--The term `covered customer' means 
        a party accused of infringing a patent or patents in dispute 
        based on a covered product or process.

        manufacturer' means a person that manufactures or supplies, or 
        causes the manufacture or supply of, a covered product or 
        process or a relevant part thereof.
            ``(3) Covered product or process.--The term `covered

                patent or patents in dispute.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 29 of 
title 35, United States Code, is amended by striking the item relating 
to section 296 and inserting the following:

        ``296. Stay of action against customer.''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to any 
action for which a complaint is filed on or after the first day of the 
30-day period that ends on that date.

SEC. 6. PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES TO IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 
              JUDICIAL CONFERENCE.

    (a) Judicial Conference Rules and Procedures on Discovery Burdens 
and Costs.--
            (1) Rules and procedures.--The Judicial Conference of the 
        United States, using existing resources, shall develop rules 
        and procedures to implement the issues and proposals described 
        in paragraph (2) to address the asymmetries in discovery 
        burdens and costs in any civil action arising under any Act of 
        Congress relating to patents. Such rules and procedures shall 
        include how and when payment for document discovery in addition 
        to the discovery of core documentary evidence is to occur, and 
        what information must be presented to demonstrate financial 
        capacity before permitting document discovery in addition to 
        the discovery of core documentary evidence.
            (2) Rules and procedures to be considered.--The rules and 
        procedures required under paragraph (1) should address each of 
        the following issues and proposals:
                    (A) Discovery of core documentary evidence.--
                Whether and to what extent each party to the action is 
                entitled to receive core documentary evidence and shall 
                be responsible for the costs of producing core 
                documentary evidence within the possession or control 
                of each such party, and whether and to what extent each 
                party to the action may seek nondocumentary discovery 
                as otherwise provided in the Federal Rules of Civil 
                Procedure.
                    (B) Electronic communication.--If the parties 
                determine that the discovery of electronic 
                communication is appropriate, whether such discovery 
                shall occur after the parties have exchanged initial 
                disclosures and core documentary evidence and whether 
                such discovery shall be in accordance with the 
                following:
                            (i) Any request for the production of 
                        electronic communication shall be specific and 
                        may not be a general request for the production 
                        of information relating to a product or 
                        business.
                            (ii) Each request shall identify the 
                        custodian of the information requested, the 
                        search terms, and a time frame. The parties 
                        shall cooperate to identify the proper 
                        custodians, the proper search terms, and the 
                        proper time frame.
                            (iii) A party may not submit production 
                        requests to more than 5 custodians, unless the 
                        parties jointly agree to modify the number of 
                        production requests without leave of the court.
                            (iv) The court may consider contested 
                        requests for up to 5 additional custodians per 
                        producing party, upon a showing of a distinct 
                        need based on the size, complexity, and issues 
                        of the case.
                            (v) If a party requests the discovery of 
                        electronic communication for additional 
                        custodians beyond the limits agreed to by the 
                        parties or granted by the court, the requesting 
                        party shall bear all reasonable costs caused by 
                        such additional discovery.
                    (C) Additional document discovery.--Whether the 
                following should apply:
                            (i) In general.--Each party to the action 
                        may seek any additional document discovery 
                        otherwise permitted under the Federal Rules of 
                        Civil Procedure, if such party bears the 
                        reasonable costs, including reasonable 
                        attorney's fees, of the additional document 
                        discovery.
                            (ii) Requirements for additional document 
                        discovery.--Unless the parties mutually agree 
                        otherwise, no party may be permitted additional 
                        document discovery unless such a party posts a 
                        bond, or provides other security, in an amount 
                        sufficient to cover the expected costs of such 
                        additional document discovery, or makes a 
                        showing to the court that such party has the 
                        financial capacity to pay the costs of such 
                        additional document discovery.
                            (iii) Limits on additional document 
                        discovery.--A court, upon motion, may determine 
                        that a request for additional document 
                        discovery is excessive, irrelevant, or 
                        otherwise abusive and may set limits on such 
                        additional document discovery.
                            (iv) Good cause modification.--A court, 
                        upon motion and for good cause shown, may 
                        modify the requirements of subparagraphs (A) 
                        and (B) and any definition under paragraph (3). 
                        Not later than 30 days after the pretrial 
                        conference under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules 
                        of Civil Procedure, the parties shall jointly 
                        submit any proposed modifications of the 
                        requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) and 
                        any definition under paragraph (3), unless the 
                        parties do not agree, in which case each party 
                        shall submit any proposed modification of such 
                        party and a summary of the disagreement over 
                        the modification.
                            (v) Computer code.--A court, upon motion 
                        and for good cause shown, may determine that 
                        computer code should be included in the 
                        discovery of core documentary evidence. The 
                        discovery of computer code shall occur after 
                        the parties have exchanged initial disclosures 
                        and other core documentary evidence.
                    (D) Discovery sequence and scope.--Whether the 
                parties shall discuss and address in the written report 
                filed pursuant to Rule 26(f) of the Federal Rules of 
                Civil Procedure the views and proposals of each party 
                on the following:
                            (i) When the discovery of core documentary 
                        evidence should be completed.
                            (ii) Whether additional document discovery 
                        will be sought under subparagraph (C).
                            (iii) Any issues about infringement, 
                        invalidity, or damages that, if resolved before 
                        the additional discovery described in 
                        subparagraph (C) commences, might simplify or 
                        streamline the case, including the 
                        identification of any terms or phrases relating 
                        to any patent claim at issue to be construed by 
                        the court and whether the early construction of 
                        any of those terms or phrases would be helpful.

                this subsection--
                            (i) by designating categories of ``core 
                        documentary evidence'', in addition to those

conference practices that--
            (1) will identify any potential dispositive issues of the

        infringement that, at a minimum, notify accused infringers of 
        the asserted claim or claims, the products or services accused 
        of infringement, and the plaintiff's theory for how each 
        accused product or service meets each limitation of each 
        asserted claim. The Judicial Conference should exercise the 
        authority under section 2073 of title 28, United States Code,
