        executed, the House of Representatives or the Senate may bring 
        an action (in the name of the House of Representatives or the

        relief to compel the President to faithfully execute that law.
            (2) Threshold for vote on resolution.--The House of 
        Representatives or the Senate shall not be considered to have 
        adopted a resolution under this section unless the resolution

        and voting.
    (b) Presidential Actions Described.--The Presidential actions 
described in this subsection are as follows:
            (1) The promulgation of a regulation or agency 
        administrative guidance.
            (2) The issuance of an Executive order, including an order

        that House in the case of a resolution described in subsection 
        (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it 
        is inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and
