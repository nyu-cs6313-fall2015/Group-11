  <summary>1/13/2014--Introduced.
Enforce the Take Care Clause Act of 2014 - Authorizes the House of Representatives or the Senate to bring an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to compel the President to execute a law faithfully upon the adoption of a resolution declaring that, on the basis of any of certain actions, the President has failed to meet the requirement of the Constitution to take care that such law be faithfully executed.

Requires approval by at least 60% of the members in either chamber for adoption of the resolution.

Describes the presidential actions involved as:

 the promulgation of a regulation or agency administrative guidance; the issuance of an executive order, including an order to not defend a challenge to the constitutionality of a law and an order to not enforce a law; and the issuance of a signing statement with respect to enactment of a law. Prescribes special rules with respect to any such action brought by the House or the Senate.</summary>
