                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 10, United States Code, to improve the prevention of and 
response to sexual assault in the Armed Forces by establishing a Sexual 
 Assault Oversight and Response Council and an enhanced Sexual Assault 
  Oversight and Response Office and by requiring the appointment of a 
Director of Military Prosecutions for sexual-related offenses committed 
        by a member of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sexual Assault Training Oversight 
and Prevention Act'' or the ``STOP Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense conducted a survey of members 
        of the Armed Forces serving on active duty that revealed that 
        only 13.5 percent of such members reported incidents of sexual 
        assault, which means that more than 19,000 incidents of sexual 
        assault of members of the Armed Forces actually occurred in 
        2010 alone.
            (2) Despite modest attempts, the Department of Defense has 
        failed to address the chronic under reporting of incidents of 
        sexual assault and harassment, as by the Department's own 
        estimates, 86 percent of sexual assaults went unreported in 
        2010.
            (3) The military adjudication system itself lacks 
        independence, as military judges depend on command, and members 
        of the Armed Forces have only limited access to civilian courts 
        to address their grievances.
            (4) The Cox Commission, sponsored by the National Institute 
        of Military Justice, as well as several other actors, have 
        consistently observed that the United States has fallen behind 
        countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom in terms of its 
        military justice system.
            (5) The military atmosphere is not conducive to resolving 
        issues of sexual assault and harassment, and sexual violence 
        continues to infect the Armed Forces.
            (6) The culture of the United States Armed Forces is based 
        on the chain of command. In a case of sexual assault, a 
        commander may be responsible for both the victim and the 
        offender, or both of their units, or the entire base or ship 
        where the offense occurred. Command discretion empowers a 
        commander to decide if the case goes forward to court martial. 
        The great deference afforded command discretion raises serious 
        concerns about conflicts of interest and the potential for 
        abuse of power.

              COUNCIL.
