                                 AN ACT


 
 To prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from enforcing the Patient 
 Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education 
                      Reconciliation Act of 2010.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On May 10, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service admitted 
        that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, seeking 
        tax-exempt status.
            (2) This action raises pertinent questions about the 
        agency's ability to implement and oversee Public Law 111-148 
        and Public Law 111-152.
            (3) This action could be an indication of future Internal 
        Revenue Service abuses in relation to Public Law 111-148 and 
        Public Law 111-152 given that it is their responsibility to 
        enforce a key provision, the individual mandate.
            (4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, 
        and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the Federal 
        Government.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITING ENFORCEMENT OF PPACA AND HCERA.

    The Secretary of the Treasury, or any delegate of the Secretary, 
shall not implement or enforce any provisions of or amendments made by 
Public Law 111-148 or 111-152.

            Passed the House of Representatives August 2, 2013.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
                                                       Calendar No. 192
