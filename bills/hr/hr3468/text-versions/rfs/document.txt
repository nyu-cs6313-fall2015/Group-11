                            ``(i) Interest on lawyers trust account.--
                        The terms `interest on lawyers trust account' 
                        and `IOLTA' mean a system in which lawyers 
                        place certain client funds in interest-bearing 
                        or dividend-bearing accounts, with the interest

                    ``(D) Rule of construction.--No provision of this 
                paragraph shall be construed as authorizing an insured 
                credit union to accept the deposits of an IOLTA or 
                similar escrow account in an amount greater than such 
                credit union is authorized to accept under any other 
                provision of Federal or State law.''.
