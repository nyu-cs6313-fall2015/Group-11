    This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Energy Production 
Protection Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT FOR CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL 
              PROTECTION AGENCY RULES.

    (a) In General.--Before a final rule or guidance is issued by the 
Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
et seq.) that may reduce the level of energy output in a specified 
sector may take effect, the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency shall submit a copy of the proposed rule or guidance 
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (in this Act 
referred to as ``OIRA'') for analysis.
    (b) OIRA Analysis.--Not later than 90 days after receiving the 
proposed rule or guidance from the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, the Administrator of OIRA shall conduct an analysis 
to determine if such rule or guidance, individually or when combined 
with another final rule or guidance issued by the Environmental 
Protection Agency, will reduce the level of energy output in a 
specified sector below the level of the prior calendar year. Such 
analysis shall include the potential impact of the rule or guidance on 
energy output in a specified sector and any potential job losses over a 
period of 10 years.

SEC. 3. PROCESS FOR APPROVAL OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Report to Congress From OIRA.--If the Administrator of OIRA 
determines that a proposed rule or guidance reduces the level of energy 
output under section 2(b), the Administrator shall, not later than 90 
days after making the determination, submit a report to Congress that 
includes--
            (1) a copy of the rule or guidance;
            (2) the proposed effective date of the rule or guidance; 
        and
            (3) the analysis conducted under section 2(b).
    (b) Congressional Action.--No rule or guidance that is the subject 
of a report submitted pursuant to subsection (a) shall take effect 
unless Congress enacts a joint resolution approving such rule or 
guidance.
    (c) Joint Resolution Defined.--For purposes of this section, the 
term ``joint resolution'' means only a joint resolution addressing a 
rule or guidance that is the subject of a report submitted pursuant to 
subsection (a) that--
            (1) bears no preamble;
            (2) bears the following title: ``Approving the ____ 
        submitted in the report from the Office of Information and 
        Regulatory Affairs on ____ relating to ____'' with--
                    (A) the first blank filled with ``rule'' or 
                ``guidance'';

                report submitted pursuant to subsection (a); and
                    (C) the third blank filled as appropriate;
            (3) includes after its resolving clause only the following:

                ``guidance'';

            (4) is introduced pursuant to subsection (d).

(or his or her respective designee) shall introduce (by request, if 
appropriate) a joint resolution described in subsection (c) within 3 
session days or legislative days, as applicable.
    (e) Rules of the Senate and House of Representatives.--This section 
is enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such is 
        deemed to be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of a joint resolution described in 
        subsection (c) and superseding other rules only where 
        explicitly so; and
            (2) with full recognition of the Constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to the
