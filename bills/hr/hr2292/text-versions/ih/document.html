``SEC. 4U. REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS.

    ``(a) Registration.--It shall be unlawful for any person to engage 
in an activity that the Commission has defined in regulations as high 
frequency trading, unless the person has registered with the Commission 
(in such form, in such manner, and providing such information as the 
Commission shall prescribe) as a high frequency trader, and the 
registration has not expired or been suspended or revoked.
    ``(b) Other Requirements.--A registered high frequency trader 
shall--
            ``(1) test all computer programs and algorithms used by the 
        trader in any high frequency trading activity and determine 
        whether the programs and algorithms are functioning properly, 
        in such manner and with such frequency as the Commission shall 
        prescribe in regulations;
            ``(2) establish and document high frequency trading system 
        safeguards reasonably designed to ensure the proper function of 
        all programs and algorithms used by the high frequency trader 
        including conditions and parameters relating to the automatic 
        termination, pausing, or cancellation of the trader's messaging 
        or trading activity, maximum message and trade execution rates 
        and order sizes, intra-day risk position limits, and market and 
        trade monitoring systems that are appropriate for ensuring 
        compliance with the system safeguards, including systems 
        designed to monitor market volatility and the trader's risk 
        position on an intra-day basis;
            ``(3) shall not simultaneously purchase and sell through 
        the same or different accounts the same commodity contract, 
        agreement, or transaction, unless the simultaneous purchases 
        and sales are of a de minimis quantity and are reported to the 
        Commission periodically, in a form and manner to be determined 
        by the Commission;
            ``(4) submit to the Commission semiannual reports on the 
        high frequency trading activities of the trader during the 
        period covered by the report, in such form, in such manner, and 
        containing such information as the Commission may require, 
        signed by the chief executive officer (or equivalent officer) 
        of the trader; and
            ``(5) conform with such business conduct standards as may 
        be prescribed by the Commission by rule or regulation that 
        relate to--
                    ``(A) fraud, manipulation, and other abusive or 
                disruptive practices, and other practices that may 
                affect market integrity involving high frequency 
                traders (including high frequency trades that are 
                offered but not entered into); and
                    ``(B) such other matters as the Commission may 
                determine are appropriate in the public interest or 
                otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this Act, 
                including information necessary to develop a 
                classification scheme and public reports relating to 
                high frequency traders and trading activity and sub-
                categories thereto.''.
    (b) Deadline for Issuance of Rules Defining High Frequency 
Trading.--Within 9 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall prescribe final 
regulations defining the activities that shall be considered to be high
