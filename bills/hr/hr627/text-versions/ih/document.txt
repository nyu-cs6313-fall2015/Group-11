     To provide for the issuance of coins to commemorate the 100th 
anniversary of the establishment of the National Park Service, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Park Service 100th 
Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1916, Congress established the National Park Service 
        as a bureau within the Department of the Interior to administer 
        America's great national parks and monuments as a unified 
        National Park System.
            (2) From 1916 to the present, the National Park System has 
        grown from 37 park units with 6,000,000 acres of land in the 
        western United States to more than 395 units with 84,000,000 
        acres of land in nearly all States and territories.
            (3) The responsibilities of the National Park Service have 
        grown to include--
                    (A) managing national historic trails and national 
                scenic trails;
                    (B) administering wild and scenic rivers;
                    (C) recognizing America's most significant historic 
                resources through the National Register of Historic 
                Places and the National Historic Landmark program;
                    (D) providing historic preservation grants; and
                    (E) assisting communities in meeting their 
                preservation, conservation, and recreation needs.
            (4) The National Park Service Organic Act of 1916, which 
        established the National Park Service, remains the preeminent 
        law guiding the management of parks and articulating the 
        Service's core mission, ``to conserve the scenery and the 
        natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to 
        provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by 
        such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of 
        future generations''.
            (5) The 100th anniversary of the National Park Service in 
        2016 will be an occasion to celebrate a century of American 
        vision and achievement in identifying and preserving our 
        Nation's special places for the benefit of everyone and the 
        culmination of 100 years of accomplishment by the National Park 
        Service's employees, partners, and volunteers. It will also 
        mark the beginning of the organization's second century of 
        service to the American people as environmental leaders and 
        vigilant stewards of the Nation's treasured places and stories.
            (6) Coins commemorating the 100th anniversary of the 
        National Park Service will bring national and international 
        attention to the National Park System and to the legacy 
        Congress left in 1916 when it established a Federal agency to 
        ensure the protection of our Nation's most treasured natural 
        and cultural resources for all time.
            (7) The proceeds from a surcharge on the sale of 
        commemorative coins will assist the financing of the needs of 
        the National Park Service's parks and programs, helping to 
        ensure that our Nation's great natural and cultural resources 
        will endure for generations to come.
