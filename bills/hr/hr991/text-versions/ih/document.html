    (a) Preliminary Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
shall submit a preliminary report to Congress on the status of coverage 
of computed tomography colonography as a colorectal cancer screening 
test under the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social 
Security Act, including the extent to which such coverage as required 
by the amendments made by sections 2 and 3 has been implemented.
    (b) Annual Report.--Not later than September 30 of each fiscal year 
during the 5-year period beginning with fiscal year 2014, the Secretary 
shall submit to the Congress, a status report on the following:
            (1) The impact of screening computed tomography 
        colonography on the change in colorectal cancer screening 
        compliance of Medicare beneficiaries.
            (2) The various utilization rates with respect to Medicare 
        beneficiaries for each available colorectal cancer screening 
        option before and after the availability of and coverage of 
        screening computed tomography colonography under the Medicare 
        program pursuant to the enactment of this Act, including--
                    (A) by initial CRC screening performed with respect 
                to a Medicare beneficiary per year, including the age 
                of the beneficiary when the initial screening was 
                performed; and
                    (B) by follow-on screening performed, whereby the 
                analysis demonstrates to what extent screening computed 
                tomography colonography was used as a substitute for a 
                previous screening procedure.
            (3) Access to screening computed tomography colonography by 
        Medicare beneficiaries, especially in rural areas or 
        underserved populations, before and after the date of 
        implementation of coverage of such screening benefit under the 
        Medicare program pursuant to the enactment of this Act.
            (4) Recommendations for such legislation and administrative 
        action as the Secretary determines appropriate to implement 
        this Act.
