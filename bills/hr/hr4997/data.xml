United States Leadership to Eradicate Obstetric Fistula Act of 2014 - Directs the President, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), to establish a 10-year strategy to combat obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan Africa that strengthens the capacity of the United States to be an effective leader in the movement for international women's health and empowerment.

Authorizes the President, through USAID, to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, a university-based medical center in the United States to carry out activities to prevent, treat, and monitor obstetric fistula in sub-Saharan African countries.

Provides for the establishment at the center of an International Obstetric Fistula Institute for Sub-Saharan Africa which shall:

 serve as the primary administrative and medical-training hub; initiate and oversee training and clinical activities of physicians, other health professionals, and educators serving at Centers of Clinical Excellence; ensure an increase in health system and workforce capacity to prevent, treat, and monitor obstetric fistula in each country in which a Center of Clinical Excellence is located; establish at least eight Centers of Clinical Excellence for Obstetric Fistula Care; and establish a United States Obstetric Fistula Treatment and Prevention Corps to provide volunteer medical services and train local surgeons and other health professionals in techniques of obstetric fistula repair and in other aspects of the care of women with obstetric fistula.
