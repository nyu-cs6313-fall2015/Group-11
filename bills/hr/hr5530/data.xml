  <summary>9/18/2014--Introduced.
Requires an agency: (1) when developing or considering approval of a management plan for federal land, to ensure that hunting activities are allowed as a use of such land to the extent that such use is not clearly incompatible with the purposes for which the land is managed; and (2) to set forth in a management plan the specific reason that hunting activities are not allowed or are restricted.

Provides that: (1) allowing contract or quota thinning of wildlife shall not constitute allowing unrestricted hunting, and (2) charging a fee related to hunting activities on federal land that exceeds what is needed to recoup costs of managing such land shall be deemed to be a restriction on hunting.

Requires fees charged related to hunting activities on federal land to be: (1) retained by the state or local authority tasked with managing the land (or, where such a state or local authority doesn't exist, by the head of the agency with jurisdiction over such land); and (2) limited to what the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) reasonably estimates to be necessary to offset the costs directly related to management of hunting on such land.</summary>
