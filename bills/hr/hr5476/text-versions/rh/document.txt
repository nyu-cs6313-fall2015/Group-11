program applies to units of the National Forest System derived from the 
  public domain by implementing a simple, equitable, and predictable 
   procedure for determining cabin user fees, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Cabin Fee Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. CABIN USER FEES.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Agriculture (referred to in this 
Act as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a fee in accordance with this 
section for the issuance of a special use permit for the use and 
occupancy of National Forest System land for recreational residence 
purposes.
    (b) Interim Fee.--During the period beginning on January 1, 2014, 
and ending on the last day of the calendar year during which the 
current appraisal cycle is completed under subsection (c), the 
Secretary shall assess an interim annual fee for recreational 
residences on National Forest System land that is an amount equal to 
the lesser of--
            (1) the fee determined under the Cabin User Fee Fairness 
        Act of 2000 (16 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.), subject to the 
        requirement that any increase over the fee assessed during the 
        previous year shall be limited to not more than 25 percent; or
            (2) $5,600.
    (c) Completion of Current Appraisal Cycle.--Not later than 1 year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall 
complete the current appraisal cycle, including receipt of timely 
second appraisals, for recreational residences on National Forest 
System land in accordance with the Cabin User Fee Fairness Act of 2000 
(16 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.) (referred to in this Act as the ``current 
appraisal cycle'').
    (d) Lot Value.--Only appraisals conducted and approved by the 
Secretary in accordance with the Cabin User Fee Fairness Act of 2000 
(16 U.S.C. 6201 et seq.) during the current appraisal cycle shall be 
used to establish the base value assigned to the lot, subject to the 
adjustment in subsection (e). If a second appraisal--
            (1) was approved by the Secretary, the value established by 
        the second appraisal shall be the base value assigned to the 
        lot; or
            (2) was not approved by the Secretary, the value 
        established by the initial appraisal shall be the base value 
        assigned to the lot.
    (e) Adjustment.--On the date of completion of the current appraisal 
cycle, and before assessing a fee under subsection (f), the Secretary 
shall make a 1-time adjustment to the value of each appraised lot on 
which a recreational residence is located to reflect any change in 
value occurring after the date of the most recent appraisal for the 
lot, in accordance with the 4th quarter of 2012 National Association of 
Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Housing Opportunity Index.
    (f) Annual Fee.--
            (1) Base.--After the date on which appraised lot values 
        have been adjusted in accordance with subsection (e), the 
        annual fee assessed prospectively by the Secretary for 
        recreational residences on National Forest System land shall be 
        in accordance with the following tiered fee structure:

        rolling average.

                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall by regulation 
                establish criteria pursuant to which the annual fee 
                determined in accordance with this section may be

                occupancy of, the recreational residence is

                fair value for the use of the land for recreational 
                residence purposes, taking into account all use 
                limitations and restrictions (including any limitations 
                and restrictions imposed by the Secretary); and
                    (B) includes any recommendations of the Secretary 
                with respect to modifying the fee system.
