                                 A BILL


 
  To suspend temporarily the duty on certain footwear, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable Footwear Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Average collected duties on imported footwear are among 
        the highest of any product sector, totaling approximately 
        $2,300,000,000 in 2011 and approximately $2,500,000,000 in 
        2012.
            (2) Duty rates on imported footwear are among the highest 
        imposed by the United States Government, with some as high as 
        the equivalent of 67.5 percent ad valorem.
            (3) The duties currently imposed by the United States were 
        set in an era during which high rates of duty were intended to 
        protect production of footwear in the United States.
            (4) Footwear produced in the United States supplies only 
        about 1 percent of the total United States market for footwear. 
        This production is concentrated in distinct product groupings, 
        which are not affected by the provisions of this Act.
            (5) Footwear duties, which are higher on lower-price 
        footwear, serve no purpose and are a hidden, regressive tax on 
        those people in the United States least able to pay.
            (6) Low- and moderate-income families spend a larger share 
        of their disposable income on footwear than higher-income 
        families.
            (7) The outdoor industry develops innovative and high 
        performance footwear that promotes healthy and active 
        lifestyles through outdoor recreation.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) there is no production in the United States of many 
        footwear articles;
            (2) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles 
        will not negatively affect manufacturing or employment in the 
        United States; and
            (3) the reduction or elimination of duties on such articles 
        will result in reduced retail prices for a wide range of 
        consumers.

SEC. 4. TEMPORARY ELIMINATION OR REDUCTION OF DUTIES ON CERTAIN 
              FOOTWEAR.

    (a) Definitions.--The U.S. Notes to subchapter II of chapter 99 of
