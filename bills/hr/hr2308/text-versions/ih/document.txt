                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Secretary of Education to establish a program to provide 
    grants for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external 
   defibrillator training in public elementary and secondary schools.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Teaching Children to Save Lives Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the 
        United States.
            (2) Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in 
        young athletes.
            (3) Each year there are nearly 10,000 cases of out-of-
        hospital cardiac arrest in children nationwide.
            (4) Receiving proper treatment known as the chain of 
        survival can double or triple the chances of survival of a 
        victim of cardiac arrest.
            (5) The 5 links in the chain of survival are prompt 
        notification of emergency services, early cardiopulmonary 
        resuscitation (in this Act referred to as ``CPR''), rapid 
        defibrillation, effective advanced life support, and integrated 
        post-cardiac arrest care.
            (6) A person experiencing sudden cardiac arrest has a 90-
        percent chance of survival if CPR and an automated external 
        defibrillator (in this Act referred to as ``AED'') are used 
        within the first minute after collapse.
            (7) An important part of the education of school children 
        is learning healthy behaviors, including proper nutrition and 
        physical activity, and that education should also include basic 
        emergency life-saving skills.
            (8) Teaching school children to recognize and respond to 
        the signs of cardiac arrest, stroke, and choking and to perform 
        the life-saving skill of CPR can improve their confidence in 
        responding to an emergency and encourage continued efforts to 
        update these skills after graduation, thereby potentially 
        reducing the rate of death from sudden cardiac arrest, stroke, 
        and choking.

SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR CPR TRAINING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

        associations to aid in providing CPR or AED training.
            (5) Options to maximize the use of funds provided under
