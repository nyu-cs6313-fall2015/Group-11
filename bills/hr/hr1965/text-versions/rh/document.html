        manufacturing to enable United States workers to benefit from

        include any disputes between the parties to a lease regarding 
        the obligations under such lease, including regarding any 
        alleged breach of the lease.

SEC. 142. EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR CERTAIN CIVIL ACTIONS RELATING TO COVERED

    In a covered civil action, the court shall not grant or approve any

drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of a 
legal requirement, and is the least intrusive means necessary to 
correct that violation. In addition, courts shall limit the duration of 
preliminary injunctions to halt covered energy projects to no more than 
60 days, unless the court finds clear reasons to extend the injunction. 
In such cases of extensions, such extensions shall only be in 30-day
