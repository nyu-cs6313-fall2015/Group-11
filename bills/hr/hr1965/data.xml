  <summary>11/20/2013--Passed House amended.
Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act of 2013 - Title I: Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security - Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act - (Sec. 1002) Directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), when practicable, to encourage the use of U.S. workers and equipment manufactured in the U.S. in all construction related to mineral resource development under this Act.

Subtitle A: Onshore Oil and Gas Permit Streamlining - Streamlining Permitting of American Energy Act of 2013 - Chapter 1: Application for Permits to Drill Process Reform - (Sec. 1111) Amends the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) to direct the Secretary to decide whether to issue a permit to drill within 30 days after receiving a permit application.

Authorizes the Secretary to extend the initial 30-day permit application review period for up to two periods of 15 days each, with written notice to the applicant.

Deems a permit application approved if the Secretary has not made a decision by 60 days after its receipt. Prescribes requirements for denial of an application, including allowing resubmission of an application and a decision to issue or deny within 10 days after resubmission.

Requires the Secretary to collect a single $6,500 permit processing fee per application at the time the decision is made whether to issue a permit.

(Sec. 1112) Requires that at least 25% of fees collected each fiscal year as annual wind energy and solar energy right-of-way authorization fees be made available for certain solar and wind permitting and management activities, and another 25% be made available for Bureau of Land Management (BLM) solar and wind permit approval activities.

Restricts the total amount of fees available for such activities to $5 million each fiscal year.

 Chapter 2: Administrative Protest Documentation Reform - (1121) Directs the Secretary to collect a $5,000 documentation fee to accompany each protest for a lease, right of way, or application for permit to drill. Requires 50% of all such fees to remain in the field office where they are collected and used to process protests subject to appropriation.

Chapter 3: Permit Streamlining - (Sec. 1131) Requires the Secretary to: (1) establish a Federal Permit Streamlining Project in every BLM field office with responsibility for permitting energy projects on federal land, and (2) enter into a related memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Chief of the Army Corps of Engineers.

Authorizes the Secretary to request that the Governor of any state with energy projects on federal lands be a signatory to the MOU.

Requires federal signatories to such a MOU to assign staff with special expertise in the pertinent regulatory issues to each BLM field office.

Requires such staff to: (1) be responsible for all issues relating to the energy projects that arise under the authorities of the employee's home agency; and (2) participate as part of the team of personnel working on proposed energy projects, planning, and environmental analyses on federal lands.

Directs the Secretary to assign to each relevant BLM field office additional personnel to ensure the effective approval and implementation of energy projects administered by BLM field offices, including inspection and enforcement relating to energy development on federal land, in accordance with the multiple use mandate of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.

(Sec. 1132) Prohibits the Secretary, in managing federal lands under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPA 2005) with respect to oil or natural gas drilling, from requiring a finding of extraordinary circumstances under a review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).

Chapter 4: Judicial Review - (Sec. 1142) Sets forth requirements for judicial review of a claim regarding agency action affecting the leasing of federal lands regarding exploration, development, production, processing, or transmission of oil, natural gas, wind, or any other source of energy.

Chapter 5: Knowing America's Oil And Gas Resources - (Sec. 1151) Requires the Secretary to provide matching funding for joint projects with states to conduct oil and gas resource assessments on federal lands with significant oil and gas potential.

Prohibits the federal share of the cost of such activities from exceeding 50%.

Authorizes $50 million for FY2014-FY2017 to implement such assessments.

 Subtitle B: Oil and Gas Leasing Certainty - Providing Leasing Certainty for American Energy Act of 2013 - (Sec. 1202) Directs the Secretary, in conducting lease sales under the MLA, to offer for sale at least 25% of the annual nominated acreage not previously made available for lease.

Shields such acreage from protest and the test of extraordinary circumstances, but makes it eligible for certain categorical exclusions under EPA 2005 and NEPA.

(Sec. 1203) Amends the MLA to prohibit the Secretary from: (1) withdrawing any covered energy project without finding a violation of lease terms by the lessee; (2) delaying indefinitely issuance of project approvals, drilling and seismic permits, and rights of way for activities under a lease; or (3) cancelling or withdrawing any lease parcel after a competitive lease sale has occurred and a winning bidder has made the last payment for the parcel.

Instructs the Secretary to: (1) make nominated areas available for lease within 18 months after an area is designated as open under a current land use plan, (2) issue all leases sold 60 days after the last payment is made, and (3) adjudicate lease protests filed following a lease sale.

Prohibits additional lease stipulations after the parcel is sold without consultation and agreement of the lessee (except certain emergency actions to conserve U.S. resources).

(Sec. 1204) Requires federal land managers to follow existing resource management plans and continue to lease actively in areas designated as open when resource management plans are being amended or revised, until such time as a new record of decision is signed.

(Sec. 1205) Declares without force or effect BLM Instruction Memorandum 2010-117 (which establishes a process to ensure orderly, effective, timely, and environmentally responsible leasing of oil and gas resources on federal lands).

Subtitle C: Oil Shale - Protecting Investment in Oil Shale the Next Generation of Environmental, Energy, and Resource Security Act, or PIONEERS Act - (Sec. 1302) Deems the final regulations regarding oil shale management published by the BLM on November 18, 2008, to satisfy all legal and procedural requirements under any law, including the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, NEPA, and EPA 2005. Directs the Secretary to implement those regulations, including the oil shale leasing program they authorize, without any other administrative action necessary.

Deems the November 17, 2008, U.S. Bureau of Land Management Approved Resource Management Plan Amendments/Record of Decision for Oil Shale and Tar Sands Resources to Address Land Use Allocations in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming and Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement also to satisfy all legal and procedural requirements under any law.

Directs the Secretary to implement the oil shale leasing program in those areas covered by the resource management plans amended by such amendments, and covered by such record of decision, without any other administrative action necessary.

(Sec. 1303) Directs the Secretary to hold a lease sale, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, that offers an additional ten parcels for lease for research, development, and demonstration of oil shale resources under the terms offered in the solicitation of bids for such leases published on January 15, 2009.

 Requires the Secretary, by January 1, 2016, to hold at least five separate commercial lease sales, in multiple lease blocs, in areas of at least 25,000 acres, which: (1) have been nominated through public comment, and (2) are considered to have the most potential for oil shale development.

Subtitle D: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 1401) Declares that nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the issuance of a lease under the MLA to any person designated for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to specified Executive Orders, certain statutes relating to Iran Sanctions, and the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003.

 Title II: Planning For American Energy - Planning for American Energy Act of 2013 - (Sec. 2002) Amends the MLA to direct the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) with regard to lands administered by the Forest Service, to publish every four years a Quadrennial Federal Onshore Energy Production Strategy to direct federal land energy development and department resource allocation in order to promote the energy and national security of the United States in accordance with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) mission to promote the multiple use of federal lands.

Instructs the Secretary to consult with the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration on the projected energy demands of the United States for the next 30 years and on how energy derived from federal onshore lands can put the United States on a trajectory that meets such demand during the next four years, with a goal for increasing energy independence and production.
