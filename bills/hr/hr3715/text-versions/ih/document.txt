Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), a drug may be imported 
into the United States, and may be reimported into the United States by 
a person other than the drug's manufacturer, if the drug--
            (1) has the same active ingredients, route of 
        administration, and strength as a prescription drug approved 
        under chapter V of such Act (21 U.S.C. 351 et seq.);
            (2) may be lawfully marketed in, and is imported or 
        reimported from, a qualified country;
            (3) is dispensed by a licensed pharmacist;
            (4) is shipped directly to, or is imported by, the ultimate 
        consumer from the qualified country;
            (5) is shipped or imported in quantities that do not exceed 
        a 90-day supply; and
            (6) is accompanied by a copy of a valid prescription.
    (b) Definitions.--In this Act:
            (1) The term ``drug'' has the meaning given to such term in 
        section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
        U.S.C. 321), except that such term excludes any controlled 
        substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled 
        Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)).
            (2) The term ``prescription drug'' means a drug subject to 
        section 503(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
        (21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)).
            (3) The term ``qualified country'' means a country that--

                Zealand, Switzerland, South Africa, a member-state of 
                the European Union, or a country in the European 
                Economic Area; and
                    (B) is determined by the Commissioner of Food and 
                Drugs to have standards for ensuring the safety and 
                effectiveness of drugs that are at least as protective 
                as such standards in the United States.
