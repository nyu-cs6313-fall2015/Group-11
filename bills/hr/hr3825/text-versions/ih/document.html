                        availability of contingency amounts that, as 
                        determined by the Secretary, are reasonable to 
                        cover unanticipated cost increases; and

                    (D) uses operational efficiencies, including 
                intelligent transportation systems, that enhance the 
                efficiency or effectiveness (or both) of the project;
                    (E) helps maintain or protect the environment; and

                by the grant recipient for the proposed project; and
                    (D) the extent to which the project has a non-
