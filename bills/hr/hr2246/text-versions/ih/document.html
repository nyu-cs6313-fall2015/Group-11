                        where a State's allocation under clause (i) is 
                        reduced, the Secretary shall distribute to all 
                        other States (as that term is defined in 
                        section 611(g)(2)) that were not subject to a 
                        reduction in allocation under such clause, the 
                        amount by which any State's allocation under 
                        section 611(d) was reduced under such clause, 
                        in accordance with subclauses (II) and (III) of 
                        section 611(d)(3)(A)(i) and without regard to

                        611(d)(3).
                            ``(iii) Use of funds by states.--Each State 
                        that receives additional funds under clause 
                        (ii) shall allocate such funds to local 
                        educational agencies in accordance with section 
                        611(f).
                            ``(iv) No consideration for future years 
                        allocation.--Notwithstanding section 611(d), in 
                        calculating the amounts for allocations under 
                        such section for fiscal year 2013 and all 
                        subsequent years, the Secretary, when 
                        determining the amount a State received under 
                        such section for a preceding fiscal year, shall 
                        not consider--

                                State's allocation increased, pursuant 
                                to clause (ii), as a result of a
