TITLE II--REPORTS ON DESIGNATION OF HEZBOLLAH AS A SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN 
     NARCOTICS TRAFFICKER AND A SIGNIFICANT TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL 
                              ORGANIZATION

SEC. 201. REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF HEZBOLLAH AS A SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN 
              NARCOTICS TRAFFICKER.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 2008, after the two year Operation Titan run by the 
        U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Colombian authorities 
        dismantled an international narcotics ring that smuggled 
        cocaine into the United States, Europe, and the Middle East, 
        and was run by Chekry Harb, also known as ``Taliban''. 
        According to lead prosecutor for the special prosecutor's 
        office in Bogota, Gladys Sanchez, ``The profits from the sales 
        of drugs went to finance Hezbollah.''.
            (2) In 2011, the Department of the Treasury blacklisted the 
        Lebanese Canadian Bank as a primary money laundering concern, 
        alleging that it is part of a drug trafficking network that 
        profited Hezbollah by moving approximately $200,000,000 per 
        month.
            (3) In April 2013, when the Department of the Treasury 
        blacklisted two Lebanese exchange houses, Kassem Rmeiti & Co. 
        and Halawi Exchange Co., for laundering drug profits for 
        Hezbollah, it stated that Hezbollah was operating like ``an 
        international drug cartel,'' adding that the ``Halawi Exchange, 
        through its network of established international exchange 
        houses, initiated wire transfers from its bank accounts to the 
        United States without using the Lebanese banking system in 
        order to avoid scrutiny associated with Treasury's designations 
        of Hassan Ayash Exchange, Elissa Exchange, and its Lebanese 
        Canadian Bank Section 311 Action. . .Money was then wire 
        transferred via Halawi's banking relationships indirectly to 
        the United States through countries that included China, 
        Singapore, and the UAE, which were perceived to receive less 
        scrutiny by the U.S. Government.''.
            (4) The Department of Justice reported that 29 of the 63 
        organizations on its FY 2010 Consolidated Priority Organization 
        Targets list, which includes the most significant international 
        drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) threatening the United 
        States, were associated with terrorist groups, and noted with 
        concern Hezbollah's international drug and criminal activities.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Hezbollah meets the criteria for designation as a 
        significant foreign narcotics trafficker as set forth in the 
        Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (21 U.S.C. 1901 et 
        seq.); and
            (2) the President should so designate Hezbollah as a 
        significant foreign narcotics trafficker.
    (c) Report.--
            (1) Report required.--Not later than 120 days after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit 
        to the appropriate congressional committees--
                    (A) a detailed report on whether the Hezbollah 
                meets the criteria for designation under the Foreign 
                Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (21 U.S.C. 1901 et 
                seq.) as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker; 
                and
                    (B) if the President determines that Hezbollah does 
                not meet the criteria for designation under the Foreign 
                Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act as a significant 
                foreign narcotics trafficker, a detailed justification 
                as to which criteria have not been met.
            (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified 
        annex.

SEC. 202. REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF HEZBOLLAH AS A SIGNIFICANT 
              TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Hezbollah is engaged array of illicit activities, from 
        counterfeiting currencies, passport documents, to stolen 
        automobile rings and other illicit activities.
            (2) In 2002, authorities in Charlotte, North Carolina 
        arrested members of a cell run by Mohammed and Chawki Hamoud 
        and convicted them on various charges, including funding the 
        activities of Hezbollah from proceeds of interstate cigarette 
        smuggling and money laundering.
            (3) In 2006 the Department of the Treasury designated 
        operations of Assad Barakat, treasurer for Hezbollah, as 
        providing material support for a foreign terrorist organization 
        and noted that Barakat had engaged in mafia-style shakedowns 
        and ``threatened TBA (triborder area) shopkeepers who are 
        sympathetic to Hezbollah's cause with having family members in 
        Lebanon placed on a `Hezbollah blacklist' if they did not pay 
        their quota to Hezbollah'' and also was ``involved in a 
        counterfeiting ring that distributes fake U.S. dollars and 
        generates cash to fund Hezbollah operations''.
            (4) In 2009, Paraguayan authorities arrested Moussa Hamdan 
        and three other individuals for selling fraudulent passports 
        and trafficking in counterfeit money and sporting goods, 
        illegally obtained consumer electronics and automobiles and 
        then using the proceeds to buy arms for Hezbollah.
            (5) In October 2011, a group of businessmen pled guilty to 
        attempting to ship electronics to a shopping center in South 
        America that the Department of the Treasury had designated as a 
        Hezbollah front.
            (6) A June 2014 ``threat assessment'' report by Canada's 
        Integrated Terrorism Assessment Centre indicated that Hezbollah 
        members in Canada are involved in organized crime.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Hezbollah meets the criteria for designation as a 
        significant transnational criminal organization under Executive 
        Order 13581 (76 Fed. Reg. 44757); and
            (2) the President should so designate Hezbollah as a 
        significant transnational criminal organization.

            (1) Report required.--Not later than 120 days after the
