Allows a tax deduction for charitable contributions for conservation purposes\u00a0of property conveyed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act by an Alaska Native Corporation.\n\nModifies the tax deduction for charitiable contributions of food inventory to: (1) increase the amount of deductible food inventory contributions that taxpayers other than C corporations may make in any taxable year from 10% to 15% of their aggregate net income and to limit such amount for a C corporation to 15% of its taxable income; (2) permit a taxpayer who is not required to account for inventories or capitalize indirect costs to elect, solely for purposes of computing the amount of such deduction, to treat the basis of any apparently wholesome food (as defined in the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act) as equal to 25% of the fair market value of such food and to set forth a formula for determining the fair market value of such food; and (3) make such deduction, as modified, permanent."
