                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to waive coinsurance 
  under Medicare for colorectal cancer screening tests, regardless of 
   whether therapeutic intervention is required during the screening.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Removing Barriers to Colorectal 
Cancer Screening Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer 
        death among men and women in the United States, killing more 
        non-smokers than any other cancer.
            (2) Every year, more than 140,000 Americans are diagnosed 
        with colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 Americans will die 
        from it.
            (3) Colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy allows for the 
        detection and removal of polyps, or abnormal growths, that 
        could become cancerous, as well as for the early detection of 
        colorectal cancer when treatment can be most effective.
            (4) If all precancerous polyps were identified and removed 
        before becoming cancerous, estimates show the number of new 
        colorectal cancer cases could be reduced by 76 to 90 percent 
        and deaths could be reduced by 70 to 90 percent.
            (5) Although colorectal cancer is largely preventable, one 
        in three adults between the ages of 50 and 75 are not up to 
        date with recommended colorectal cancer screening.
            (6) Two-thirds of colorectal cancer cases are diagnosed in 
        patients over the age of 65.
            (7) Colorectal cancer screening colonoscopy is a highly 
        effective preventive service, and removing financial barriers 
        can help to increase rates of screening.

SEC. 3. WAIVING MEDICARE COINSURANCE FOR COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING 
              TESTS.

    (a) In General.--Section 1833(a)(1)(Y) of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 1395l(a)(1)(Y)) is amended by inserting ``, including a 
colorectal cancer screening test (regardless of the code that is billed 
for the establishment of a diagnosis as a result of the test, or for 
the removal of tissue or other procedure that is furnished in 
connection with, as a result of, and in the same clinical encounter as 
the screening test),'' after ``section 1861(ddd)(3)''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to items and services furnished after the date of the enactment 
of this Act.
                                 <all>
