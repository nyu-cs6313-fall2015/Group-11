Sets the funding level for those grants at the amount of funding provided to states for federal elementary and secondary education programs and the amount provided for federal postsecondary education programs, respectively, for FY2012, minus the funding they were provided for education programs that this Act transfers to other federal agencies.\n\nRequires states to contract for an annual audit of their expenditures or transfers of grant funds.\n\nRequires the transfer of:\n\n each of the Department's job training programs to the Department of Labor; each special education grant program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); each of the Department's Indian Education programs to the Department of the Interior; each Impact Aid program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to the Department of Defense (DOD); and the Federal Pell Grant program and the Federal Family Education Loan and William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan programs, under the Higher Education Act of 1965, to the Department of HHS. Sets a fiscal year cap on Federal Pell Grant funding."
