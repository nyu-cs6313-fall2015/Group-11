  <summary>7/17/2014--Introduced.
Breast Density and Mammography Reporting Act of 2014 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require mammography facilities to include up-to-date information about breast density in both the written report of the results of a mammography examination provided to the patient's physician and the summary of that written report given to patients. Requires the summary to: (1) convey the effect of breast density in masking the presence of breast cancer on a mammogram, and (2) include language communicating that individuals with dense breasts should talk with their physicians about any questions or concerns regarding the summary and whether they would benefit from additional tests.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand and intensify research on breast density, the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of supplemental imaging relating to breast density, and best practices concerning mammograms and supplemental screening for those with dense breasts.</summary>
