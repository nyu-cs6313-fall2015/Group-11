  <summary>9/11/2014--Introduced.
Child Support Assistance Act of 2014 - Amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act, with respect to the permissible purposes of consumer reports, to authorize a consumer reporting agency to furnish a consumer report in response to a request by the head of a state or local child support enforcement agency (or an authorized state or local government official), if the requester certifies that the report is needed for enforcing a child support order, award, agreement, or judgment.

Repeals: (1) the requirement for 10 days' prior notice to a consumer whose report is requested, and (2) the authorization for any consumer reporting agency to furnish a report to an agency administering a state plan for child and spousal support in order to set an initial or modified child support award.</summary>
