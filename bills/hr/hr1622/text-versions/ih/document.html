To amend the Small Business Act to ensure fairness and transparency in 
               contracting with small business concerns.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness and Transparency in 
Contracting Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act--
            (1) the terms ``Administration'' and ``Administrator'' mean 
        the Small Business Administration and the Administrator 
        thereof, respectively;
            (2) the term ``parent company'', relating to a business 
        concern, means a person other than an individual that owns not 
        less than 51 percent of that business concern;
            (3) the terms ``small business concern'', ``small business 
        concern owned and controlled by veterans'', ``small business 
        concern owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans'', 
        and ``small business concern owned and controlled by women'' 
        have the meanings given those terms in section 3 of the Small 
        Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632), as amended by this Act; and
            (4) the term ``small business concern owned and controlled 
        by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals'' has 
        the meaning given that term in section 8(d)(3)(C) of the Small 
        Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)(3)(C)).

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to modify the definitions relating to 
whether a business concern qualifies as a small business concern to 
establish additional requirements that ensure that no publically traded 
business concern, subsidiary of a publically traded business concern, 
foreign-owned business concern, or subsidiary of a foreign-owned 
business concern is considered a small business concern for the purpose 
of Federal Government contracting and subcontracting, including for 
procurement goals.

                are not United States citizens.
            ``(B) Entities.--In determining ownership of a business 
        concern, any interest in the business concern that is owned by 
        a person that is not an individual (including a corporation,
