 To amend chapter 83 of title 41, United States Code, to increase the 
    requirement for American-made content, to strengthen the waiver 
                  provisions, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Buy American Improvement Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. STRENGTHENING AND SIMPLIFYING FEDERAL PROCUREMENT POLICIES.

    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator for Federal Procurement 
Policy, in consultation with the Federal Acquisition Regulatory 
Council, shall promulgate regulations to standardize and simplify how 
Federal agencies comply with, report on, and enforce chapter 83 of 
title 41, United States Code (commonly known as the Buy American Act). 
The regulations shall include, at a minimum, the following:
            (1) Guidelines for determining, for the purposes of 
        applying sections 8302(a) and 8303(b)(3) of such title, the 
        circumstances under which the acquisition of articles, 
        materials, or supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in the 
        United States is inconsistent with the public interest.
            (2) Uniform procedures for collecting, reporting, and 
        making publicly available information about waivers under 
        chapter 83 of such title, including--
                    (A) procedures for making a request for a waiver 
                publicly available before granting the waiver; and
                    (B) procedures for providing the rationale for why 
                a waiver is granted.
            (3) Rules to ensure that projects are not disaggregated for 
        purposes of avoiding the applicability of the requirements 
        under chapter 83 of such title to such larger project.
            (4) Procedures for investigating waiver requests.
            (5) Rules for evaluating the percentage of domestic content 
        in a manufactured end product.
    (b) Guidelines Relating to Inconsistency With Public Interest.--In 
the guidelines developed under subsection (a)(1), the Administrator 
shall consider any significant decrease in employment in the United 
States resulting from the granting of waivers to be inconsistent with 
the public interest and seek to minimize--
            (1) the granting of waivers that would result in a decrease 
        in employment in the United States in both the short- and long-
        term; and
            (2) the granting of waivers for procurement of articles, 
        materials, or supplies mined, produced, or manufactured in a 
        foreign country with which the United States does not have a 
        relevant trade agreement and which has a government that 
        maintains, in regard to government procurement, a significant 
        and persistent pattern or practice of discrimination against 
        products produced in the United States.
    (c) Procedures Relating to the Publication of Requests for 
Waivers.--In the procedures developed under subsection (a)(2)(A), the 
Administrator shall require the head of a Federal agency, after 
receiving a request for a waiver, to complete each of the following:
            (1) Publish the request for a waiver on a publicly 
        available website of the agency in an easily identifiable 
        location within 15 days after receiving such request.
            (2) A waiver may not be issued before the expiration of the 
        15-day period beginning on the date on which the request for 
        waiver is published pursuant to paragraph (1) to provide the 
        public an opportunity for notice and comment.
    (d) Procedures Relating to the Publication of Waivers Granted.--In 
the procedures developed under subsection (a)(2)(B), the Administrator 
shall require the head of a Federal agency to publish the determination 
for why a waiver was granted and the rationale for such determination 
in the Federal Register and on a publicly available website of the 
agency in an easily identifiable location not later than 30 days after 
the head of the agency determines to issue such waiver.
    (e) Rules Relating to Domestic Content.--In the rules developed 
under subsection (a)(5), the Administrator shall not consider as 
domestic content components of foreign origin of the same class or kind 
as those that are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United 
States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of 
a satisfactory quality.
    (f) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' means any 
        executive agency (as defined in section 133 of title 41, United 
        States Code) or any establishment in the legislative or 
        judicial branch of the Federal Government.
            (2) Relevant trade agreement.--The term ``relevant trade 
        agreement'' means--
                    (A) a reciprocal defense procurement memorandum of 
                understanding, as described in section 8304 of title 
                41, United States Code;
                    (B) any trade agreement for which the President, or 
                his delegate, has issued a blanket waiver under section 
                301 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 
                2511); and
                    (C) any trade agreement described in subpart 25.4 
                of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
            (3) Waiver.--The term ``waiver'' means, with respect to the 
        acquisition of an article, material, or supply for public use, 
        the inapplicability of chapter 83 of title 41, United States 
        Code, to the acquisition by reason of any of the following 
        determinations:
                    (A) A determination by the head of the Federal 
                agency concerned that the acquisition is inconsistent 
                with the public interest.
                    (B) A determination by the head of the Federal 
                agency concerned that the cost of the acquisition is 
                unreasonable.
                    (C) A determination by the head of the Federal 
                agency concerned that the article, material, or supply 
                is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United 
                States in sufficient and reasonably available 
                commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality.

SEC. 3. INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN FEDERAL 
              PROCUREMENT.

    Subsection (b) of section 8302 of title 41, United States Code, is
