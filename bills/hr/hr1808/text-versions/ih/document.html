        the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
            (2) Force and effect.--A map and legal description filed

    (a) Management.--Subject to valid existing rights, lands designated 
as wilderness by this Act shall be managed by the Secretary in 
accordance with the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.) and this 
Act, except that, with respect to any wilderness areas designated by 
this Act, any reference in the Wilderness Act to the effective date of 
the Wilderness Act is deemed to be a reference to the date of enactment 
of this Act.
    (b) Incorporation of Acquired Land and Interest.--Any land within 
the boundary of the land designated as wilderness by section 3 that is 
acquired by the United States shall--
            (1) become part of the wilderness area; and
            (2) be managed in accordance with this section.
    (c) Fish and Wildlife.--As provided in section 4(d)(7) of the 
Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1133(d)(7)), nothing in this Act shall be 
construed as affecting the jurisdiction or responsibilities of the 
State of Maine with respect to wildlife and fish.
    (d) Buffer Zones.--Congress does not intend for the designation of 
wilderness areas in the State under this section to lead to the 
creation of protective perimeters or buffer zones around any wilderness 
area.
    (e) Activities or Uses up to Boundaries.--The fact that 
nonwilderness activities or uses can be seen or heard from within a 
wilderness designated by this Act shall not, of itself, preclude the 
activities or uses up to the boundary of the wilderness area.
    (f) Navigational Devices.--Consistent with the purpose of the 
Wilderness Act, the Secretary may authorize the installation of 
navigational devices in any wilderness area designated by this Act for 
the purpose of improving public health and safety.
    (g) Landing of Watercraft.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed 
as prohibiting the landing of a watercraft on an island on which is 
located any area designated as a wilderness area by this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
