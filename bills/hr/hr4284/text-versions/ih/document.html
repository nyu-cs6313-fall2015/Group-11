                in accordance with this paragraph.
                    ``(B) Publication of notice.--Not later than 90 
                days before proposing to add a species to a list under 
                this subsection, the Secretary shall notify each State

                opportunity to submit to the Secretary a proposed State 
                Protective Action for the species in that State, 
                including specification of the criteria for approval of 
                such an action under this paragraph.

                Action for the species in such State or States within 
                the period specified by the Secretary for the 
                submission of public comment regarding the inclusion of 
                the species in the list.

                proposed State Protective Action under subparagraph 
                (A), the Secretary shall provide guidance to the State

                                end of the 45-day period beginning on 
                                the date the Secretary provides such 
                                comments; and
                                    ``(III) by not later than 30 days 
                                after the end of such period, issue a 
                                final decision regarding the proposed

                    ``(F) Limitation on final listing.--The Secretary 
                may not add a population of a species to a list before 
                the date the Secretary has made a final determination 
                regarding approval of each State Protective Action for 
                such population that has been submitted in accordance 
                with this paragraph.
                    ``(G) Qualification for grants.--For purposes of 
                subsection (d), a State Protective Action approved by 
                the Secretary under this paragraph shall be treated as 
                a cooperative agreement entered into pursuant to this 
                subsection.
                    ``(H) Review of plans.--Every 5 years after 
                approving a State Protective Action, the Secretary 
                shall review the implementation and effectiveness of 
                the action, and if necessary provide guidance on 
                improvements or revisions that are required to maintain 
                the Secretary's approval of the action.
                    ``(I) Revocation of approval.--The Secretary may 
                revoke approval of a State Protective Action for a 
                population and propose adding such species to a list 
                under this subsection if at any time after completion 
                of the first review under subparagraph (H) the 
                Secretary determines that--
                            ``(i) the State has failed to implement the 
                        action; or
                            ``(ii) the action has failed to make 
                        measurable progress toward achieving the 
                        recovery criteria for the population.
                    ``(J) Termination.--The Secretary may terminate the 
                effectiveness of a State Protective Action approved 
                under this paragraph, including review regarding the 
                action under subparagraph (H), if the Secretary 
                determines that recovery criteria for the population 
                have been achieved.''.
