        supplemental claims for educational assistance under chapter 33 
        of title 38, United States Code, are adjudicated 
        electronically; and

        respect to such claims with little human intervention.

enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit 
to Congress a report on the changes made pursuant to the requirements
