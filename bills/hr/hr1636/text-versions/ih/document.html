                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit certain 
State election administration officials from actively participating in 
                          electoral campaigns.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Election Integrity Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) chief State election administration officials have 
        served on political campaigns for Federal candidates whose 
        elections those officials will supervise;
            (2) such partisan activity by the chief State election 
        administration official, an individual charged with certifying 
        the validity of an election, represents a fundamental conflict 
        of interest that may prevent the official from ensuring a fair 
        and accurate election;
            (3) this conflict impedes the legal duty of chief State 
        election administration officials to supervise Federal 
        elections, undermines the integrity of Federal elections, and 
        diminishes the people's confidence in our electoral system by 
        casting doubt on the results of Federal elections;
            (4) the Supreme Court has long recognized that Congress's 
        power to regulate Congressional elections under Article I, 
        Section 4, Clause 1 of the Constitution is both plenary and 
        powerful; and
            (5) the Supreme Court and numerous appellate courts have 
        recognized that the broad power given to Congress over 
        Congressional elections extends to Presidential elections.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES BY CHIEF STATE ELECTION 
              ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS.
