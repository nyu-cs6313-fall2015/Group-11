 To provide for incentives for agencies and the judiciary to increase 
                         operating efficiency.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``To Help Reduce Inefficient Federal 
Tendencies Act of 2014'' or as the ``THRIFT Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. AGENCY INCENTIVE AND SAVINGS PROGRAM.

    (a) Purpose.--In order to provide an incentive for agencies and the 
judicial branch to re-engineer business processes and otherwise 
increase operating efficiency, it is the intent of the Congress to 
allow agencies and the judicial branch to retain a portion of the 
savings produced by internally generated agency or judicial branch 
program efficiencies and cost reductions.
    (b) Retention of Funds.--To be eligible to retain funds, an agency 
or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court must submit a plan and an 
associated request to amend its approved operating budget to the 
committees of Congress having jurisdiction over appropriations 
specifying--
            (1) the modifications to approved programs resulting in 
        efficiencies and cost savings;
            (2) the amount and source of the funds and positions saved;
            (3) the specific positions, rate, amounts, and sources of 
        funds the agency or the judicial branch wishes to include in 
        its incentive expenditures;
            (4) how the agency or the judicial branch will meet the 
        goals and objectives established in its strategic plans;
            (5) how the agency or the judicial branch will meet 
        performance standards, including those in its performance 
        plans; and
            (6) any other incentive expenditures which the agency or 
        the judicial branch believes will enhance its performance.
    (c) Submission to Congress.--All plans and budget amendments 
submitted to the committees of Congress having jurisdiction over 
appropriations pursuant to this section shall be delivered at least 30 
days prior to the date of the committee meetings at which the request 
will be considered.
    (d) Determination.--In determining the amount the agency or the 
judicial branch will be allowed to retain, the committees shall 
consider the actual savings projected for the current budget year and 
the annualized savings.
    (e) Amount of Funding Retained.--The amount to be retained by the 
agency or the judicial branch shall be no less than 5 percent and no 
more than 25 percent of the annual savings and may be used by the 
agency or the judicial branch for salary increases, including awards 
authorized in section 4512 of title 5, United States Code, or other 
expenditures specified in the agency's or the judicial branch's plan if 
the salary increases or other expenditures do not create a recurring 
cost to the Treasury in excess of the recurring savings achieved by the 
agency or the judicial branch in the plan.
    (f) Submission of Budget Request.--Each agency or judicial branch 
allowed to retain funds pursuant to this section shall submit in its 
next budget request a schedule showing how it used such funds.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
