SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, 
        sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New 
        Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from her 
        home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, he had been 
        convicted previously of a sex offense against a child.
            (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104-
        145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by 
        identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing the 
        means to monitor their activities.
            (3) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex 
        offenders are traveling internationally, and that the criminal 
        background of such individuals may not be known to local law 
        enforcement prior to their arrival.
            (4) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child 
        sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The 
        International Labour Organization has estimated that 1.8 
        million children worldwide are victims of child sex trafficking 
        and pornography each year.
            (5) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a 
        foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child in 
        that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where 
        commercial, child sex trafficking.
            (6) According to research conducted by The Protection 
        Project of The Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of 
        Advanced International Studies, sex tourists from the United 
        States who target children form a significant percentage of 
        child sex tourists in some of the most significant destination 
        countries for child sex tourism.
            (7) In order to protect children, it is essential that 
        United States law enforcement be able to identify child-sex 
        offenders in the United States who are traveling abroad and 
        child-sex offenders from other countries entering the United 
        States. Such identification requires cooperative efforts 
        between the United States and foreign governments. In exchange 
        for providing notice of child-sex offenders traveling to the 
        United States, foreign authorities will expect United States 
        authorities to provide reciprocal notice of child-sex offenders 
        traveling to their countries.
