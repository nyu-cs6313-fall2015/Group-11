share for a water resources study or project, including credit for in-
kind contributions provided to accelerate completion of a water 
resources study or project, toward the required non-Federal cost-share 
for a different water resources study or project.
    (b) Restrictions.--
            (1) In general.--Except for subsection (a)(4)(D)(i) of that 
        section, the requirements of section 221 of the Flood Control

            (2) Conditions.--Credit in excess of the non-Federal cost-
        share for a study or project may be approved under this section

                    (A) the non-Federal interest submits a 
                comprehensive plan to the Secretary that identifies--
                            (i) the studies and projects for which the

    (c) Additional Criteria.--In evaluating a request to apply credit 
in excess of the non-Federal cost-share for a study or project toward a

            (2) reduce costs to the Federal Government; and
