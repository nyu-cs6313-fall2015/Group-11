SEC. 2. ELECTRONIC LIFE SAFETY AND SECURITY SYSTEMS FEDERAL BACKGROUND 
              CHECKS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The electronic life safety and security systems 
        industry performs critical security installation and protection 
        for much of the infrastructure in the United States and 
        provides commercial buildings, public agencies and residences 
        with alarm and security systems that are an important part of 
        homeland security and anti-crime and terrorist prevention.
            (2) The electronic life safety and security systems 
        industry includes central monitoring stations and individual 
        employer-owned companies and other private sector businesses 
        that install alarm and security systems in infrastructure of 
        the United States.
            (3) Some States do not provide for any licensing or 
        regulation requirement that includes a State or Federal 
        background check on employees of the companies involved in the 
        electronic life safety and security systems industry.
            (4) Many employees in the electronic life safety and 
        security systems industry travel across State lines to install 
        systems and may or may not be required to undergo Federal 
        background checks as a condition of employment and in some 
        cases there may be background check requirements at the State 
        level or duplicated background checks at the county or city 
        levels.

    (d) Establishment of Background Check.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of

        Federal fingerprint-based criminal history background checks, 
        in accordance with the information contained in records 
        acquired under section 534 of title 28, United States Code.

                        covered entities to the State authorized 
                        agency; and

                prospective employee's fitness for employment in the 
                electronic life safety and security systems industry, 
                based on whether the employee or prospective employee 
                has, during the 10-year period before the background 
                check is conducted, been convicted of or imprisoned for 
                a felony or an offense involving dishonesty or false 
                statement or the use of force against the person of

                that employee's or prospective employee's fitness for 
                employment, the Attorney General shall provide the 
                employee or prospective employee with the criminal 
                history records of the employee or prospective employee 
                and a detailed notification of the rights of the
