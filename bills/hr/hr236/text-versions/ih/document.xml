				General may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend or revoke any
				license issued under this section, or may subject the licensee to a civil
				penalty of not more than $10,000 per violation, if the holder of the license
				has willfully violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or regulation
				prescribed by the Attorney General under this chapter or fails to have secure
				gun storage or safety devices available at any place in which firearms are sold
				under the license to persons who are not licensees (except that in any case in
				which a secure gun storage or safety device is temporarily unavailable because
				of theft, casualty loss, consumer sales, backorders from a manufacturer, or any
				other similar reason beyond the control of the licensee, the dealer shall not
				be considered to be in violation of the requirement to make available such a
				device). The Attorney General may, after notice and opportunity for hearing,
				suspend or revoke the license of, or assess a civil penalty of not more than
				$10,000 on, a dealer who willfully transfers armor piercing ammunition. The
				Attorney General may at any time compromise, mitigate, or remit the liability
				with respect to any willful violation of this chapter or any rule or regulation
				prescribed by the Attorney General under this chapter. The Attorney General’s
				actions under this subsection may be reviewed only as provided in subsection
