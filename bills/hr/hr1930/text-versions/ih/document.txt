to use such product to defraud a drug test.
    (b) Definition.--As used in this Act, the term ``defraud a drug 
test'' means--
            (1) submit a substance that purports to be from an 
        individual other than its actual source, or purports to have 
        been excreted or collected other than when it was actually
