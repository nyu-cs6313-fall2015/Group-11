        local, and tribal governments to participate in the review 
        process, expand coordination with such agencies and 
        governments, and require the identification as early as 
        practicable in the process of any--
                    (A) Federal agency or State, local, or tribal 
                government with jurisdiction over the project or 
                required by law to conduct or issue a review or make a

                agencies;
                    (B) conducting concurrent and integrated reviews, 
                analyses, opinions, and permits, licenses, or approvals 
                to the maximum extent practicable;
                    (C) establishing timelines, in coordination with 
                affected Federal agencies, for completion of those 
                reviews, analyses, opinions, and permits, licenses, or 
                approvals;
                    (D) developing a coordination plan and schedule, in

                reviews in a timely manner;

        authorities and other nonappropriated funding sources to 
        support early coordination and project review;
            (8) expand the use of information technology tools and 
        identify priority areas for information technology investment 
        to replace paperwork processes, enhance effective project 
        siting decisions, enhance interagency collaboration, and 
        improve the monitoring of project impacts and mitigation 
        commitments;
            (9) ensure that documents developed under the procedures 
        are adopted and used by other Federal agencies, and State, 
        local, and tribal governments, to the maximum extent 
        practicable, to eliminate redundancy and duplicative reviews;
            (10) include improvements to mitigation policies to provide

        assessments, facilitate interagency mitigation plans where 
        appropriate, ensure accountability and long-term effectiveness 
        of mitigation activities, and utilize innovative mechanisms 
        where appropriate; and

        expansion of categorical exclusions for infrastructure projects 
        described under subsection (a) that conform to those of other 
        modal administrations.

                components;
                    (E) integration of reviews under section 106 of the 
                National Historic Preservation Act, reviews under 
                section 303 of title 49, United States Code, and 
                environmental reviews; and
                    (F) consistency in treatment of railroads 
                nationwide for historic preservation purposes.
