  <summary>10/23/2013--Introduced.
Equal Healthcare Access Act - Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to administer a health insurance program for non-federal employees under the existing Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program. Extends eligibility for such program to any qualified individual (i.e., any individual other than an individual who is enrolled or eligible to be enrolled in FEHB, including as a family member).

Authorizes employers, under arrangements satisfactory to OPM, to: (1) offer their employees coverage under such program, and (2) make a contribution toward the cost of such coverage.

Deems a health care plan under such program to be a plan offered through an Exchange established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act for purposes of complying with the individual mandate to purchase health insurance.</summary>
