United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. HOLOCAUST EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM.

    Part D of title V of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 7241 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subpart:

          ``Subpart 22--Holocaust Education Assistance Program

``SEC. 5631. SHORT TITLE.

    ``This subpart may be cited as the `Simon Wiesenthal Holocaust 
Education Assistance Act'.

``SEC. 5632. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) The Holocaust was a historical event that resulted in 
        the systemic, state-sponsored, mass murders by Nazi Germany of 
        6,000,000 Jews, along with millions of others, in the name of 
        racial purity.
            ``(2) Six States (California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, 
        New Jersey, and New York) now mandate that the Holocaust be 
        taught in the educational curriculum, and 11 States (Alabama, 
        Connecticut, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, North 
        Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington, and West 
        Virginia) recommend teaching the Holocaust but the funds 
        necessary to carry out those recommendations may not be 
        available.
            ``(3) The Holocaust is a sensitive and difficult subject to 
        teach effectively, and educators need appropriate teaching 
        tools and training to increase their knowledge of the Holocaust 
        and enhance the educational experience.
    ``(b) Statement of Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subpart--
            ``(1) to educate students in the United States so that 
        they--
                    ``(A) may explore the lessons that the Holocaust 
                provides for all people; and
                    ``(B) may be less susceptible to the falsehood of 
                Holocaust denial and to the destructive messages of 
                hate that arise from Holocaust denial; and
            ``(2) to provide resources and support for educational 
        programs that--
                    ``(A) portray accurate historical information about 
                the Holocaust;
                    ``(B) sensitize communities to the circumstances 
                that gave rise to the Holocaust;
                    ``(C) convey the lessons that the Holocaust 
                provides for all people; and
                    ``(D) develop curriculum guides and provide 
                training to help teachers incorporate the study of the 
                Holocaust and its lessons into mainstream disciplines.
