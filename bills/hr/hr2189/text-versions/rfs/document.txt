logs of each ship under the authority of the Secretary of the Navy that 
is known to have operated in the waters near Vietnam during the period 
beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, to determine--
            (1) whether each such ship operated in the territorial 
        waters of the Republic of Vietnam during such period; and
            (2) for each such ship that so operated--
                    (A) the date or dates when the ship so operated;

Affairs shall make publicly available all unclassified information 
provided to the Secretary under subsection (b).

SEC. 302. METHODS FOR VALIDATING CERTAIN SERVICE CONSIDERED TO BE 
              ACTIVE SERVICE BY THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Merchant Marine Act, 1936 established the United 
        States Maritime Commission, and stated as a matter of policy 
        that the United States should have a merchant marine that is 
        ``capable of serving as a naval and military auxiliary in time 
        of war or national emergency''.
            (2) The Social Security Act Amendments of 1939 (Public Law 
        76-379) expanded the definition of employment to include 
        service ``on or in connection with an American vessel under 
        contract of service which is entered into within the United 
        States or during the performance of which the vessel touches at 
        a port in the United States, if the employee is employed on and 
        in connection with such vessel''.
            (3) The Joint Resolution to repeal sections 2, 3, and 6 of 
        the Neutrality Act of 1939, and for other purposes (Public Law 
        77-294; 55 Stat. 764) repealed section 6 of the Neutrality Act 
        of 1939 (related to the arming of United States vessels) and 
        authorized the President during the national emergency to arm 
        or permit to arm any United States vessel.
            (4) On February 7, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 
        through Executive Order Number 9054, established the War 
        Shipping Administration that was charged with building or 
        purchasing, and operating the civilian shipping vessels needed 
        for the war effort.
            (5) During World War II, United States merchant mariners 
        transported goods and materials through ``contested waters'' to 
        the various combat theaters.
            (6) At the conclusion of World War II, United States 
        merchant mariners were responsible for transporting several 
        million members of the United States Armed Forces back to the 
        United States.
            (7) The GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202) 
        provided that the Secretary of Defense could determine that 
        service for the Armed Forces by organized groups of civilians, 
        or contractors, be considered ``active service'' for benefits 
        administered by the Veterans Administration.
            (8) Department of Defense Directive 1000.20 directed that 
        the determination be made by the Secretary of the Air Force, 
        and established the Civilian/Military Service Review Board and 
        Advisory Panel.
            (9) In 1987, three merchant mariners along with the AFL-CIO 
        sued Edward C. Aldridge, Secretary of the Air Force, 
        challenging the denial of their application for veterans 
        status. In Schumacher v. Aldridge (665 F. Supp. 41 (D.D.C. 
        1987)), the Court determined that Secretary Aldridge had failed 
        to ``articulate clear and intelligible criteria for the 
        administration'' of the application approval process.
            (10) During World War II, women were repeatedly denied 
        issuance of official documentation affirming their merchant 
        marine seaman status by the War Shipping Administration.
            (11) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) 
        identifies the following acceptable forms of documentation for 
        eligibility meeting the requirements set forth in the GI Bill 
        Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202) and Veterans 
        Programs Enhancement Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-368):
                    (A) Certificate of shipping and discharge forms.
                    (B) Continuous discharge books (ship's deck or 
                engine logbooks).
                    (C) Company letters showing vessel names and dates 
                of voyages.
            (12) Coast Guard Commandant Order of March 20, 1944, 
        relieved masters of tugs, towboats, and seagoing barges of the 
        responsibility of submitting reports of seamen shipped or 
        discharged on forms, meaning certificates of shipping and 
        discharge forms are not available to all eligible individuals 
        seeking to document their eligibility.
            (13) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April 1992) states 
        that ``deck logs were traditionally considered to be the 
        property of the owners of the ships. After World War II, 
        however, the deck and engine logbooks of vessels operated by 
        the War Shipping Administration were turned over to that agency 
        by the ship owners, and were destroyed during the 1970s'', 
        meaning that continuous discharge books are not available to 
        all eligible individuals seeking to document their eligibility.
            (14) Coast Guard Information Sheet #77 (April, 1992) states 
        ``some World War II period log books do not name ports visited 
        during the voyage due to wartime security restrictions'', 
        meaning that company letters showing vessel names and dates of 
        voyages are not available to all eligible individuals seeking 
        to document their eligibility.

Service by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.--

        Improvement Act of 1977 (Public Law 95-202; 38 U.S.C. 106 note)

                records submitted for or by the individual, together 
                with validated testimony given by the individual or the 
                primary next of kin of the individual that the 
                individual performed such service during the period

                    (B) In the case of an individual who served on a 
                coastwise merchant vessel seeking such recognition for

                form, ship logbook, merchant mariner's document or Z-
                card, or other official employment record has been 
                destroyed or otherwise become unavailable by reason of 
                any action committed by a person responsible for the 
                control and maintenance of such form, logbook, or 
                record, the Secretary shall accept other official 
                documentation demonstrating that the individual 
                performed such service during period beginning on 
                December 7, 1941, and ending on December 31, 1946.
                    (C) For the purpose of determining whether to 
                recognize service allegedly performed during the period 
                beginning on December 7, 1941, and ending on December 
                31, 1946, the Secretary shall recognize masters of 
                seagoing vessels or other officers in command of 
                similarly organized groups as agents of the United 
                States who were authorized to document any individual 
                for purposes of hiring the individual to perform 
                service in the merchant marine or discharging an 
                individual from such service.
            (2) Treatment of other documentation.--Other documentation 
        accepted by the Secretary of Homeland Security pursuant to 
        paragraph (1)(B) shall satisfy all requirements for eligibility 
        of service during the period beginning on December 7, 1941, and 
        ending on December 31, 1946.
            (3) Benefits allowed.--
                    (A) Burial benefits eligibility.--Service of an 
                individual that is considered active duty pursuant to
