SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On September 11 and 12, 2012, terrorists attacked the 
        United States Special Mission compound and Annex in Benghazi, 
        Libya.
            (2) The attacks resulted in the deaths of Ambassador John 
        Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen 
        Doherty, in addition to severely wounding other United States 
        personnel and Libyan guards.
            (3) The United States personnel in Benghazi performed 
        bravely in protecting their colleagues despite the scale and 
        intensity of the attacks.
            (4) An Accountability Review Board chaired ably by 
        Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering and vice-chaired by Admiral 
        Michael Mullen, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
        was subsequently convened to examine security failures leading 
        to the attacks.
            (5) The Board found, in particular, the following:
                    (A) Systemic failures in leadership and management 
                at the Department of State led to inadequate security 
                and unclear lines of responsibility for security 
                considerations in Benghazi.
                    (B) Physical security at the site was inadequate 
                and local Libyan responders failed to adequately 
                respond to the sudden penetration of the mission.
                    (C) There were no immediate, specific tactical 
                warnings of an attack although officials were aware of 
                intelligence gaps on militia activity in Libya and the 
                threat such activity posed to United States interests.
            (6) The Board made 29 recommendations for the Department of 
        State, including--
                    (A) enhancing security in high risk, high threat 
                posts and reviewing the balance between the risk and 
                benefits of a particular post;
                    (B) reexamining organization and management with a 
                focus on security planning in the Bureau of Diplomatic 
                Security;
                    (C) establishing minimum security standards for 
                temporary facilities, such as Benghazi, in high risk, 
                high threat environments; and
                    (D) improving training for personnel serving in 
                high risk, high threat posts.
            (7) Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accepted all 
        of the Board's recommendations and directed that they be 
        implemented.
            (8) United States public servants work in dangerous places 
        around the world to advance United States interests and values, 
        and it is not possible to conduct robust diplomatic and 
        development efforts without inherent risk.
            (9) The dedicated men and women of the foreign and civil 
        service are worthy of a serious and sustained commitment to 
        enhancing security and better protecting them when they serve 
        in hostile environments.
