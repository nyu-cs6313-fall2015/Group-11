                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to encourage the 
    increased use of performance contracting in Federal facilities.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Savings Through Public-
Private Partnerships Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Private sector funding and expertise can help address 
        the energy efficiency challenges facing the United States.
            (2) The Federal Government spends more than $6 billion 
        annually in energy costs.
            (3) Reducing Federal energy costs can help save money, 
        create jobs, and reduce waste.
            (4) Energy savings performance contracts and utility energy 
        service contracts are tools for utilizing private sector 
        investment to upgrade Federal facilities without any up-front 
        cost to the taxpayer.
            (5) Performance contracting is a way to retrofit Federal 
        buildings using private sector investment in the absence of 
        appropriated dollars.
            (6) Retrofits that reduce energy use also improve 
        infrastructure, protect national security, and cut facility 
        operations and maintenance costs.

SEC. 3. USE OF ENERGY AND WATER EFFICIENCY MEASURES IN FEDERAL 
              BUILDINGS.
