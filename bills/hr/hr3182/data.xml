  <summary>9/25/2013--Introduced.
Safe and Secure Border Infrastructure Act - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to establish a safe and secure border infrastructure grant program, administered jointly by the Secretary and the Administrator of General Services (GSA), to construct transportation infrastructure improvements at existing and new international border crossings for the safe, secure, and efficient cross-border movement of motor vehicles, non-motor vehicles, cargo, and individuals, including pedestrians.

Requires the Secretary to award grants to metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) located along the international border with Canada and Mexico, giving priority to projects that accomplish one or more of the following: (1) improve the safety and security at U.S. facilities, including ports of entry; (2) facilitate safe, secure, and legal trade crossings of motor vehicles, non-motor vehicles, cargo, and individuals, including pedestrians, to alleviate border congestion and reduce the economic effect of border wait times and delays; (3) implement innovative technologies that enhance safety, security, or efficiency at the border; (4) coordinate projects that improve security and systems efficiencies at ports of entry; (5) facilitate economic development strategies with respect to safety and security; and (6) implement congestion relief and air quality management strategies to improve the environment.

Specifies allocations of any funds appropriated to carry out this Act.</summary>
