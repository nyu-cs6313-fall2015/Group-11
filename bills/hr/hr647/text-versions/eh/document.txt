SEC. 102. QUALIFIED ABLE PROGRAMS.

    (a) In General.--Subchapter F of chapter 1 is amended by inserting 
after section 529 the following new section:

``SEC. 529A. QUALIFIED ABLE PROGRAMS.

    ``(a) General Rule.--A qualified ABLE program shall be exempt from 
taxation under this subtitle. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, 
such program shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 
(relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of 
charitable organizations).
    ``(b) Qualified ABLE Program.--For purposes of this section--
            ``(1) In general.--The term `qualified ABLE program' means 
        a program established and maintained by a State, or agency or 
        instrumentality thereof--
                    ``(A) under which a person may make contributions 
                for a taxable year, for the benefit of an individual 
                who is an eligible individual for such taxable year, to 
                an ABLE account which is established for the purpose of 
                meeting the qualified disability expenses of the 
                designated beneficiary of the account,
                    ``(B) which limits a designated beneficiary to 1 
                ABLE account for purposes of this section,
                    ``(C) which allows for the establishment of an ABLE 
                account only for a designated beneficiary who is a 
                resident of such State or a resident of a contracting 
                State, and
                    ``(D) which meets the other requirements of this 
                section.
            ``(2) Cash contributions.--A program shall not be treated 
        as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides that no 
        contribution will be accepted--
                    ``(A) unless it is in cash, or
                    ``(B) except in the case of contributions under 
                subsection (c)(1)(C), if such contribution to an ABLE 
                account would result in aggregate contributions from 
                all contributors to the ABLE account for the taxable 
                year exceeding the amount in effect under section 
                2503(b) for the calendar year in which the taxable year 
                begins.
        For purposes of this paragraph, rules similar to the rules of 
        section 408(d)(4) (determined without regard to subparagraph 
        (B) thereof) shall apply.
            ``(3) Separate accounting.--A program shall not be treated 
        as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides separate 
        accounting for each designated beneficiary.
            ``(4) Limited investment direction.--A program shall not be 
        treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides that any 
        designated beneficiary under such program may, directly or 
        indirectly, direct the investment of any contributions to the 
        program (or any earnings thereon) no more than 2 times in any 
        calendar year.
            ``(5) No pledging of interest as security.--A program shall 
        not be treated as a qualified ABLE program if it allows any 
        interest in the program or any portion thereof to be used as 
        security for a loan.
            ``(6) Prohibition on excess contributions.--A program shall 
        not be treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides 
        adequate safeguards to prevent aggregate contributions on 
        behalf of a designated beneficiary in excess of the limit 
        established by the State under section 529(b)(6). For purposes 
        of the preceding sentence, aggregate contributions include 
        contributions under any prior qualified ABLE program of any 
        State or agency or instrumentality thereof.
    ``(c) Tax Treatment.--
            ``(1) Distributions.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Any distribution under a 
                qualified ABLE program shall be includible in the gross 
                income of the distributee in the manner as provided 
                under section 72 to the extent not excluded from gross 
                income under any other provision of this chapter.

                expenses.--For purposes of this paragraph, if 
                distributions from a qualified ABLE program--

                        disability expenses of the designated 
                        beneficiary, no amount shall be includible in 
                        gross income, and

                        otherwise includible in gross income shall be 
                        reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio 
                        to such amount as such expenses bear to such 
                        distributions.

                        paid or distributed from an ABLE account to the 
                        extent that the amount received is paid, not 
                        later than the 60th day after the date of such 
                        payment or distribution, into another ABLE 
                        account for the benefit of the same designated 
                        beneficiary or an eligible individual who is a 
                        family member of the designated beneficiary.
