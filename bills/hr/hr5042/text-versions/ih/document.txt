    with non-Federal entities for the construction of major medical

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The buildings of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        have an average age of 60 years.
            (2) Since 2004, use of Department facilities has grown from 
        80 percent to 120 percent, while the condition of these 
        facilities has eroded from 81 percent to 71 percent over that 
        same period of time.
            (3) The Department currently manages and maintains more 
        than 5,600 buildings and almost 34,000 acres of land.
            (4) More than 3,900 infrastructure gaps remain that will 
        cost between $54,000,000,000 and $66,000,000,000 to close, 
        including $10,000,000,000 in activation costs.
            (5) The Veterans Health Administration has 21 major 
        construction projects dating to 2007 that have been only 
        partially funded.
            (6) The total unobligated amount for all currently budgeted 
        major construction projects exceeds $2,900,000,000.
            (7) To finish existing projects and to close current and 
        future gaps, the Department will need to invest at least 
        $23,200,000,000 over the next 10 years.
            (8) At current requested funding levels, it will take more 
        than 67 years to complete the 10-year capital investment plan 
        of the Department.

        equal to the estimated Federal share of the cost of such work. 
        Any costs that exceed the amount originally agreed upon between 
        the Secretary and the non-Federal entity shall be paid by the 
        non-Federal entity. The Secretary may commence making payments

        requested has been performed in accordance with applicable 
        permits and approved plans.
            (3) Budget requests.--The Secretary shall budget for 
        reimbursement under this section on a schedule that is

United States shall submit to Congress a biennial report on the 
partnership agreements entered into under the pilot program.
