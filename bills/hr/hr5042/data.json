Directs the Secretary to select 10 major medical facility projects authorized for the construction of a new facility for which: (1) Congress has appropriated funds, (2) the design and development phase is complete, and (3) construction has not begun as of the date of enactment of this Act. Requires four of such projects to be seismic-related projects and four to be community based outpatient clinic-related projects.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) appoint a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) entity as the project manager of each project; (2) ensure that the project manager implements a project management plan to ensure concise and consistent communication of all parties involved; (3) work in cooperation with each participating non-federal entity to minimize multiple change orders; (4) develop metrics to monitor change order process times, with the intent of expediting any change order; and (5) monitor construction to ensure that it is in compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and VA acquisition regulations and that the costs are reasonable."
