Security and Opportunity for Vulnerable Migrant Children Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretary of State to submit to Congress a strategy to address the economic, social, and security factors driving large numbers of unaccompanied alien children from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to the United States.

 Directs the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to: (1) coordinate with the heads of federal agencies and the governments of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to promote public policies which prioritize growth, poverty reduction, and sustainable alternatives to emigration; and (2) incorporate such programming with assistance to communities and economic sectors in such countries.

Amends the the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 to remove pilot program status from (and so make permanent) the program to repatriate unaccompanied alien children.

Directs the Secretary to designate an Ambassador-at-Large for unaccompanied alien children.</summary>
