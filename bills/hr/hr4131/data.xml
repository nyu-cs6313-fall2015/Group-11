  <summary>2/28/2014--Introduced.
State and Local Predatory Towing Enforcement Act - Waives federal preemption to allow states to regulate tow truck operations performed without the prior consent or authorization of the owner or operator of the towed motor vehicle.

(Currently, states are allowed to regulate only the price of for-hire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck, if such transportation is performed without the prior consent or authorization of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle.)</summary>
