  <summary>6/24/2014--Passed House amended.
Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act of 2014 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to report to Congress on recommendations (made pursuant to an earlier report) concerning improvements in the collection and dissemination of compatible epidemiological studies on the incidence and prevalence of traumatic brain injury in individuals who were formerly in the military, identifying recommendations that have been adopted and describing activities planned to address those that were not adopted.

 Authorizes appropriations through FY2019 for: (1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projects to reduce the incidence of traumatic brain injury, and (2) traumatic brain injury surveillance systems or registries.

 Authorizes appropriations through FY2019 for the programs of grants to: (1) states and American Indian consortia for projects to improve access to rehabilitation and other services regarding traumatic brain injury, and (2) protection and advocacy systems for the purpose of enabling such systems to provide services to individuals with traumatic brain injury. Removes the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration as agent for the Secretary in administering these programs. Vests responsibility for administering the programs solely in the Secretary.

Requires the Secretary to report to Congress not later than one year after enactment of this Act on the services and activities of the protection and advocacy systems.</summary>
