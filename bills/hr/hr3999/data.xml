  <summary>2/5/2014--Introduced.
Family and Medical Leave Enhancement Act of 2014 - Amends the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) to cover employees at worksites that employ fewer than 50 employees, but not fewer than 25 employees. Continues to exempt from FMLA coverage employees at worksites that employ fewer than 25 employees (currently 50), if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is fewer than 25 (currently 50).

Allows an employee covered by FMLA to take up to 4 hours during any 30-day period, and up to 24 hours during any 12-month period, of parental involvement leave to: (1) participate in or attend activities that are sponsored by a school or community organization, and (2) relate to a program of the school or organization that is attended by the employee's child or grandchild.

Permits the use of such parental involvement leave to meet routine family medical care needs, including: (1) such employee's medical and dental appointments, or their spouse, child, or grandchild; and (2) the care needs of their related elderly individuals, including visits to nursing homes and group homes.

Allows an employee to elect, or an employer to require, substitution of any of the paid or family leave or paid medical or sick leave of the employee for any leave provided under this Act.

Declares that nothing in this Act shall require an employer to provide paid sick leave or paid medical leave in situations where such employer would not normally provide any such paid leave.

Imposes on the employee requesting leave certain notification requirements. Allows an employer to require certification supporting such requests.

Applies the parental involvement and family wellness leave allowance to federal employees.</summary>
