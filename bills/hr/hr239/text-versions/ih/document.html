SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Zero-based Budgeting Ensures 
Responsible Oversight (ZERO) Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. ZERO-BASED BUDGETING.

    Section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(i)(1) The President shall submit with materials related to each 
budget transmitted under subsection (a) on or after January 1, 2015, a 
budget for each department and agency which contains the following 
information:
            ``(A) A description of each activity for which the 
        department or agency receives an appropriation in the current 
        fiscal year or for which the department or agency requests an 
        appropriation for the budget year.
            ``(B) The legal basis for each activity.
            ``(C) For each activity, three alternative funding levels 
        for the budget year, and a summary of the priorities that would 
        be accomplished within each level, and the additional 
        increments of value that would be added by the higher funding 
        levels. At least two of these funding levels shall be below the 
        funding level for the current fiscal year.
            ``(D) For each activity, one or more measures of its cost 
        efficiency and effectiveness.
    ``(2) As soon as practicable, the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget shall publish guidelines to carry out this 
subsection. The guidelines shall require that the baseline budget of 
each department or agency is assumed to be zero and each proposed 
expenditure shall be justified as if it were a new expenditure.''.
