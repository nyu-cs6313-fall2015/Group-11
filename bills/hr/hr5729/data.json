(A voucher entitles the holder to have a future human drug application acted upon by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) within six months.)\n\nChanges the process by which infectious diseases that do not significantly impact developed nations and disproportionately affect poor and marginalized populations can be designated as tropical diseases from rulemaking to order of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nAllows priority review vouchers to be transferred between sponsors of human drug applications any number of times.\n\nReduces from 365 days to 90 days the advance notice required before submitting a human drug application subject to a priority review voucher."
