To direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
  to designate New Jersey Task Force 1 as part of the National Urban 
                       Search and Rescue System.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ADDITION OF TEAM TO NATIONAL URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE SYSTEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 
        demonstrated the importance of enhancing national domestic 
        terrorism preparedness.
            (2) Twenty-six of the 28 urban search and rescue teams 
        included in the National Urban Search and Rescue System of the 
        Federal Emergency Management Agency were called into action in 
        the wake of the events of September 11th.
            (3) Highly qualified, urban search and rescue teams not 
        included in the National Urban Search and Rescue System were 
        the first teams in New York City on September 11th.
            (4) The continuing threat of a possible domestic terrorist 
        attack remains an important mission for which the Nation must 
        prepare to respond.
            (5) Part of that response should be to increase the number 
        of urban search and rescue teams included in the National Urban 
        Search and Rescue System.
    (b) Addition of New Jersey Task Force 1.--The Administrator of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency shall designate New Jersey Task 
Force 1 as part of the National Urban Search and Rescue System.
                                 <all>
