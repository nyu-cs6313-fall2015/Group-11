            (1) In general.--Paragraph (10) of section 1847(b) of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(b)) is amended--
                    (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking the second 
                sentence and inserting the following new sentence: 
                ``The volume for such types of products shall be 
                determined through the use of multiple sources of data 
                that measure consumption and utilization of diabetic 
                testing strips among individuals in the United 
                States.''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following new 
                subparagraphs:
                    ``(C) Demonstration of ability to furnish types of 
                diabetic testing strips.--With respect to the program 
                described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall 
                reject a bid submitted by an entity if the entity does 
                not, as part of the demonstration to the Secretary 
                described in such subparagraph submitted by the entity, 
                demonstrate that the entity has an ability to furnish 
                the types of diabetic testing strips included in its 
                bid, including an ability to obtain and maintain an 
                inventory of such strips by volume in a manner 
                consistent with its bid.
                    ``(D) Use of unlisted types in calculation of 
                percentage.--In determining under subparagraph (A) 
                whether a bid submitted by an entity under such 
                subparagraph covers 50 percent (or such higher 
                percentage as the Secretary may specify) of all types 
                of diabetic testing strip products, the Secretary may 
                not attribute a percentage to types of diabetic testing 
                strips that the Secretary does not provide the entity 
                with the option to identify by type and market share 
                volume.
                    ``(E) Contract requirement.--Any contract entered 
                into with an entity for diabetic testing strips under 
                the competition conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) 
                shall include a requirement that the entity offers, 
                makes available to, and maintains in inventory of (or 
                otherwise has ready access to, such as through 
                purchasing contracts) each of the types of diabetic 
                testing strip products that is included in the bid 
                submitted by the entity. In the case that an entity 
                enters into such a contract with the Secretary and 
                fails to fulfill the requirement described in the 
                preceding sentence, the Secretary shall terminate such 
                contract.
                    ``(F) Monitoring adherence to demonstration.--The 
                Secretary shall establish a process to monitor, on an 
                ongoing basis, the extent to which an entity that 
                enters into a contract with the Secretary for diabetic 
                testing strips under the competition conducted pursuant 
                to paragraph (1) adheres to the demonstration that the 
                entity provided to the Secretary under subparagraph 
                (A).''.
            (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 1847(b)(3)(A) of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(b)(3)(A)) is amended by 
        adding at the end the following new sentence: ``In the case 
        that such a contract is for diabetic testing strips, such 
        contract shall include the information required under paragraph 
        (10)(E).''
    (b) Codifying and Expanding Anti-Switching Rule.--Section 1847(b) 
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3(b)), as amended by 
subsection (a)(1), is further amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraph (11) as paragraph (12); and
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (10) the following new 
        paragraph:
            ``(11) Additional special rule in case of competition for 
        diabetic testing strips.--
                    ``(A) In general.--With respect to diabetic testing

                may not attempt to influence or incentivize the 
                individual described in such subparagraph to switch the 
                brand of glucose monitor or testing strips selected by 
                the individual, including by--
                            ``(i) persuading, pressuring, or advising

                        alternative brands to the individual in the 
                        case that the individual has not requested such 
                        information.

                directly to an individual described in such 
                subparagraph until the entity has verbally provided the 
                individual with standardized information, to be 
                supplied to the entity by the Secretary, that describes 
                the rights of the individual with respect to the
