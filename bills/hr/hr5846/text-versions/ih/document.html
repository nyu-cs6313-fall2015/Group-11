SEC. 2. FINDINGS; POLICY.

    Section 2 of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 
U.S.C. 6401) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) in paragraph (4), in the fourth sentence, by 
                inserting ``prohibitions on ritual animal slaughter, 
                male infant circumcision, censorship of religious 
                content, or worship on the Internet,'' after 
                ``confiscations of property,'';
                    (B) in paragraph (5), by amending the second 
                sentence to read as follows: ``In many countries, 
                religious believers are forced to meet secretly, and 
                religious leaders and believers are targeted by 
                national security forces, violent nonstate actors, and 
                hostile mobs.'';
                    (C) by redesignating paragraph (7) as paragraph 
                (9); and
                    (D) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following 
                new paragraphs:
            ``(7) There is growing evidence that demonstrates a 
        connection between the absence of religious freedom and 
        increased levels of persecution of religious minorities, 
        religiously motivated conflict, violent extremism, and 
        terrorism, including the kind of terrorism that has reached the 
        United States.
            ``(8) It is increasingly clear that understanding religion 
        and the political and security implications of religious 
        motivation and conviction is critical to the success of United 
        States diplomacy and foreign policy initiatives as there are 
        studies that show--
                    ``(A) 75 percent of the world's population lives in 
                countries where the right to the freedom of religion 
                and belief is severely restricted, either by the 
                government or violent nonstate actors; and
                    ``(B) 84 percent of the world's population 
                identifies strongly with a specific religious group.''; 
                and
            (2) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following 
        new paragraph:
            ``(6) Because the promotion of international religious 
        freedom is a foreign policy strategy that protects other, 
        related human rights, advances democracy abroad, and is linked 
        directly to United States interests in stability, security, and 
        development globally, the promotion of international religious 
        freedom requires new and evolving policies, religion engagement 
        strategies, and diplomatic responses that are drawn from the 
        expertise of the national security agencies, the diplomatic 
        services, Congress, and other governmental agencies and 
        nongovernmental organizations, and are coordinated across and 
        carried out by the entire range of Federal agencies that are 
        engaged with or conduct negotiations or United States 
        Government funded programs with governments or violent nonstate 
        actors that engage in or tolerate violations of religious 
        freedom.''.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

        actor' means a nonsovereign entity or group that exercises 
        significant political power or influence at a national or

        of violence, destabilizes existing government structures or 
        gains defacto or actual control over large territories within 
        existing countries and which engages in or tolerates violations 
        of religious freedom.
            ``(16) Institution of higher education.--The term 
        `institution of higher education' has the meaning given that

potential for shaping positive leadership and new educational models in 
host countries and for their emphasis on teaching universally 
recognized rights of free inquiry and academic freedom.
    ``(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that United 
States institutions of higher education operating campuses outside the 
United States or establishing any educational entities with foreign 
governments, particularly with or in countries the governments of which 
engage in or tolerate severe violations of religious freedom as 
identified in the Annual Report and the annual report of the

conduct--

        religion peacefully as protected in international law;

        memoranda of understanding engaged in or constructed with a 
        foreign government to establish any educational entity, shall

        President required by section 108 of the National Security Act 
        of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3043) should promote international religious 
        freedom as a foreign policy and national security priority and 
        should articulate that promotion of the right to freedom of 
        religion or belief is a strategy that protects other, related 
        human rights, and advances democracy outside the United States, 
        and make clear its importance to United States foreign policy 
        goals of stability, security, development, and diplomacy;
            ``(2) the national security strategy report should be a 
        guide for the strategies and activities of relevant Federal

        Code, and the Department of State Quadrennial Diplomacy and 
        Development Review; and

        security strategy that emphasizes the challenges of integrating 
        religious freedom into United States foreign policy at all 
        levels, the President should consider--
                    ``(A) adopting a whole-of-government approach to 
                promote international religious freedom by creating 
                senior policy positions and committees at the National 
                Security Council, chaired by the Senior Directors of
