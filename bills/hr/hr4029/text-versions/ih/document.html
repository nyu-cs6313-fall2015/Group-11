SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Ozark National Scenic Riverways was created under 
        the auspices of protecting public access to the area 
        indefinitely.
            (2) The National Park Service has begun to prevent members 
        of the public from accessing the lands that compose the park.
            (3) The State of Missouri is able to maintain the park and 
        ensure that it continues in substantially the same fashion as 
        it has while maintaining public access.

    The Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the establishment of the 
Ozark National Scenic Riverways in the State of Missouri, and for other 
purposes'', approved August 27, 1964 (16 U.S.C. 460m, et seq.), is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``Sec. 9.  Not later than one year after the date of the enactment 
of this section, the Secretary shall convey to the State of Missouri, 
for no consideration, all right, title, and interest of the United 
States in and to all Federal land, facilities, and any other assets 
associated with the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, subject to the 
following conditions:
            ``(1) The Federal Government shall pay all of the costs of 
        the conveyance under this section.
            ``(2) A covenant or restriction shall be in the deed to the 
        land and facilities conveyed under this section requiring--
                    ``(A) that the State of Missouri shall maintain and 
                operate the land, facilities, and assets conveyed under 
                this section, at the cost to the State, in 
                substantially the same fashion as such land, 
                facilities, and assets were being maintained by the 
                Department of the Interior on the day before the date 
                of the enactment of this section;
                    ``(B) that if the State of Missouri attempts to 
                sell, in whole or in part, the land, facilities, or 
                assets conveyed under this section, such the land, 
                facilities, and assets shall revert to the United 
                States, at the discretion of the Secretary, at no cost 
                to the United States;
                    ``(C) that if the land and facilities conveyed 
                under this section are no longer used as described in 
                subparagraph (A), the land and facilities shall revert 
                to the United States, at the discretion of the 
                Secretary, at no cost to the United States; and
                    ``(D) any other terms and conditions that the 
                Secretary determines to be appropriate.
    ``Sec. 10.  The first section and sections 2 through 8 of this Act 
shall not apply during any period during which title to the land 
associated with the Ozark National Scenic Riverways is not held by the 
United States.''.
