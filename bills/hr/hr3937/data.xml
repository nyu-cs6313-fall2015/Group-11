  <summary>1/28/2014--Introduced.
Declares that it is the policy of Congress that our fuel supply needs to be diverse and one method of diversification is the use of natural gas as a fuel source in long haul trucks.

Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to appoint representatives from DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Commerce, Members of Congress, state governments, and private sector individuals to evaluate: (1) barriers to transition from diesel fuel to natural gas in long haul trucks (commercial vehicles with a 26,000 pound or greater gross vehicle weight rating); (2) environmental benefits, as well as other benefits and drawbacks, of using natural gas in such trucks; (3) the expected price differential between traditional diesel oems and natural gas oems; (4) concerns of the participating representatives appointed by the Secretary of using natural gas in long haul trucks; and (5) the effect of using natural gas in such trucks on the Highway Trust Fund.</summary>
