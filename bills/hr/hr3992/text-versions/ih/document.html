                year is enacted that specifies an amount for wildfire 
                suppression operations in the Wildland Fire Management 
                accounts at the Department of Agriculture or the 
                Department of the Interior, then the adjustments for 
                that fiscal year shall be the amount of additional new 
                budget authority provided in that Act for wildfire 
                suppression operations for that fiscal year, but shall 
                not exceed $2,689,000,000 in additional new budget

                    ``(ii) As used in this subparagraph--
                            ``(I) the term `additional new budget 
                        authority' means the amount provided for a

                        operations over the previous 10 years, in an 
                        appropriation Act and specified to pay for the 
                        costs of wildfire suppression operations; and
                            ``(II) the term `wildfire suppression 
                        operations' means the emergency and 
                        unpredictable aspects of wildland firefighting 
                        including support, response, and emergency 
                        stabilization activities; other emergency 
                        management activities; and funds necessary to 
                        repay any transfers needed for these costs.
                    ``(iii) The average costs for wildfire suppression 
                operations over the previous 10 years shall be 
                calculated annually and reported in the President's 
                Budget submission under section 1105(a) of title 31,

                inserting ``; less''; and
                    (C) by adding the following:
                                    ``(III) the additional new budget 
                                authority provided in an appropriation 
                                Act for wildfire suppression operations 
                                pursuant to subparagraph (E) for the 
                                preceding fiscal year.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
                            ``(v) Beginning in fiscal year 2016 and in
