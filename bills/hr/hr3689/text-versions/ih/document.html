                                 A BILL


 
    To restore Second Amendment rights in the District of Columbia.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Second Amendment Enforcement 
Act''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The law-abiding citizens of the District of Columbia 
        are deprived by local laws of handguns, rifles, and shotguns 
        that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons throughout the 
        United States for sporting use and for lawful defense of their 
        persons, homes, businesses, and families.
            (2) The District of Columbia has among the highest per 
        capita murder rates in the Nation, which may be attributed in 
        part to local laws prohibiting possession of firearms by law-
        abiding persons who would otherwise be able to defend 
        themselves and their loved ones in their own homes and 
        businesses.
            (3) Officials of the District of Columbia have indicated 
        their intention to continue to unduly restrict lawful firearm 
        possession and use by citizens of the District.
            (4) Legislation is required to correct the District of 
        Columbia's law in order to restore the fundamental rights of 
        its citizens under the Second Amendment to the United States 
        Constitution and thereby enhance public safety.

SEC. 3. REFORM D.C. COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT FIREARMS.

    Section 4 of the Act entitled ``An Act to prohibit the killing of 
wild birds and wild animals in the District of Columbia'', approved 
June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 809; sec. 1-303.43, D.C. Official Code), is 
amended by adding at the end the following: ``Nothing in this section 
or any other provision of law shall authorize, or shall be construed to 
permit, the Council, the Mayor, or any governmental or regulatory 
authority of the District of Columbia to prohibit, constructively 
prohibit, or unduly burden the ability of persons not prohibited from 
possessing firearms under Federal law from acquiring, possessing in 
their homes or businesses, transporting for legitimate purposes, or 
using for sporting, self-protection or other lawful purposes, any 
firearm neither prohibited by Federal law nor subject to the National 
Firearms Act. The District of Columbia shall not have authority to 
enact laws or regulations that discourage or eliminate the private 
ownership or use of firearms. Nothing in the previous two sentences 
shall be construed to prohibit the District of Columbia from regulating 
the carrying of firearms by a person, either concealed or openly, other 
than at the person's dwelling place, place of business, or on other 
land possessed by the person.''.
