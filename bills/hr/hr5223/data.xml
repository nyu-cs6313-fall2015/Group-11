  <summary>7/28/2014--Introduced.
Restoring the Doctors of Our Country through Scholarships Act of 2014 or RDOCS Act of 2014 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration to make matching grants under which states provide RDOCS scholarships, paying all costs of a student's undergraduate medical education, to provide for the increased availability of primary health care services in health professional shortage areas.

Requires the scholarship recipient to agree to residency training in a primary care specialty and a five-year post-graduate period of service in a health professional shortage area.

Requires that preference be given in awarding scholarships to applicants enrolled in: (1) an accelerated track family-medicine program (an integrated course of study allowing completion of undergraduate medical education and graduate medical education in six years), or (2) a program that includes clinical training in rural or underserved urban communities.</summary>
