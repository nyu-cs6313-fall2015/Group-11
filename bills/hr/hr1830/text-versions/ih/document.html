Cancer Act of 2013''.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the United States, the chance of a woman developing 
        breast cancer during her lifetime has increased from 1 in 11 in 
        1975 to 1 in 8 today.
            (2) Worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently 
        diagnosed cancer in women with 1.3 million cases each year and 
        the leading cause of cancer death with more than 500,000 women 
        dying from the disease in 2010.
            (3) More than 90 percent of deaths from breast cancer are 
        caused by metastasis, when breast cancer has spread to other 
        organs or bone.
            (4) The National Cancer Institute estimated that breast 
        cancer care in the United States cost $16.5 billion in 2009 and 
        cost the Nation $12.1 billion in lost productivity.
            (5) Very little has improved in terms of breast cancer 
        incidence, morbidity, and mortality rates over the past 40 
        years.

SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT.

    The President shall establish a commission to be known as the 
Commission to Accelerate the End of Breast Cancer (in this Act referred 
to as the ``the Commission'').

SEC. 5. MISSION; DUTIES.

    (a) Mission.--The mission of the Commission shall be to help end 
breast cancer by January 1, 2020.
    (b) Duties.--The Commission shall--
            (1) identify opportunities and ideas within government and 
        the private sector that are key components in achieving the end 
        of breast cancer and which have been overlooked, yet are ripe 
        for collaboration and investment, and
            (2) recommend projects to leverage such opportunities and 
        ideas in the areas of--
                    (A) the primary prevention of breast cancer; and
                    (B) the causes and prevention of breast cancer 
                metastasis.
    (c) Means.--In carrying out the duties described in subsection (b), 
the Commission shall--
            (1) identify revolutionary opportunities and ideas in

        on ending breast cancer;
            (2) identify timely opportunities and scientific 
        discoveries which can be turned into real world strategies to 
        prevent breast cancer and prevent breast cancer metastasis and

                    (B) unlikely to be achieved by the private sector 
                due to technical and financial uncertainty;
            (5) identify promising, underdeveloped areas of research 
        that would benefit from a cluster of government, industry, and 
        academia forming innovation communities to rapidly advance 
        knowledge into practice, while creating new opportunities for 
        job creation and advancement;
            (6) identify opportunities for transdisciplinary cross-
        cutting collaborations; and
