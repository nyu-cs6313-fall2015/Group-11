To require the Forest Service to accommodate, to the extent consistent 
   with the management objectives and limitations applicable to the 
   National Forest System lands at issue, individuals with mobility 
    disabilities who need to use a power-driven mobility device for 
                    reasonable access to such lands.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ACCOMMODATION OF ACCESS NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MOBILITY 
              DISABILITIES UNDER FOREST SERVICE TRAVEL MANAGEMENT RULE.

    (a) Consideration of Access Needs of Individuals With Mobility 
Disabilities.--The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief 
of the Forest Service, shall require Forest Service personnel, in 
implementing off-road vehicle management under the Forest Service 
Travel Management Rule, to endeavor to accommodate, to the extent 
consistent with the management objectives and limitations applicable to 
the National Forest System lands at issue, individuals with mobility 
disabilities who would need to use a power-driven mobility device for 
reasonable access to such lands.
    (b) Response to Requests for Access.--If, after receiving a request 
by or on behalf of an individual with mobility disabilities for 
permission to use a power-driven mobility device to access specific 
National Forest System lands, Forest Service personnel determine that 
use of such a power-driven mobility device is not appropriate given the 
management objectives and limitations applicable to the National Forest 
System lands at issue, the Forest Service personnel shall provide the 
individual with a written response containing an explanation of the 
reasons for the determination.
                                 <all>
