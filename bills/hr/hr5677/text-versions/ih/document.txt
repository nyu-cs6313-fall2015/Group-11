SEC. 3. CLASSIFICATION OF WILDLAND FIREFIGHTERS.

    (a) Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--Within 30 days after the date of the

        Code, and in cooperation with the Federal land management 
        agencies, shall commence development of a separate and distinct 
        Wildland Firefighter occupational series that will more 
        accurately reflect the variety of duties performed by wildland 
        firefighters.
            (2) Designation.--The Office of Personnel Management shall 
        ensure that the official title assigned to any occupational

        hand crew, hotshot, smokejumper, battalion chief, helitack, 
        fuels, and engine module.
            (3) Positions described.--Paragraph (1) applies with 
        respect to any class or other category of positions that 
        consists primarily or exclusively of forestry technician

                covering positions for which the primary duties are 
                wildland firefighting, as determined by the Office; and
                    ``(B) in such other circumstances as the Office may 
                by regulation prescribe; and''.
    (c) Employees Currently in the 401 Fire Management Specialist

Act, holds a position of wildland firefighter shall have the option of
