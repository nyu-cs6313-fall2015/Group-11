Consolidate Heavy-handed and Outdated Programs Act of 2014 - Consolidates the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Department of Energy and the Environment (DEE), with the primary mission of ensuring U.S. security and prosperity by: (1) protecting human health; (2) safeguarding the natural environment; and (3) addressing U.S. energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions. Transfers to the DEE Secretary all of the functions of the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of Energy.

Establishes within the Department: (1) an Energy and Environmental Information Administration, (2) an Office of Science, (3) an Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, (4) an Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, and (5) the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as an independent regulatory commission. Transfers to the Commission specified functions of the Federal Power Commission (FPC). Preserves the Southeastern Power Administration, the Southwestern Power Administration, and the Bonneville Power Administration as distinct organizational entities within DEE, each headed by an Administrator.

Requires the DEE Secretary to establish policy for the National Nuclear Security Administration and assess annually the vulnerability of Department facilities to a terrorist attack.

Requires the President to submit a proposed National Energy Policy Plan to Congress by April 1, 2015, and biennially thereafter.</summary>
