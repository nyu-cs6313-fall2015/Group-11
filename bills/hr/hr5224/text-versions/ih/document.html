                                 A BILL


 
   To amend title 38, United States Code, to establish a scholarship 
program to increase the availability of physicians who provide primary 
    health care services at medical facilities of the Department of 
                           Veterans Affairs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Restoring the Doctors of Our Country 
through Scholarships Veterans Affairs Act of 2014'' or the ``RDOCS-VA 
Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Medical facilities of the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs are in dire need of more physicians, with a particular 
        need for doctors trained in primary care specialties.
            (2) The Health Professionals Educational Assistance Program 
        established by chapter 76 of title 38, United States Code, 
        provides educational assistance through scholarships and loan 
        forgiveness for a range of health professionals, however, it 
        does not specifically encourage a commitment to primary care by 
        physicians employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
            (3) The Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) model of 
        education and training is a respected and effective way of 
        meeting the need of the United States for educated and trained 
        officers in the Armed Forces, and it can be applied to train 
        and educate physicians to provide primary care services.
            (4) Congress can build off of the Health Professionals 
        Educational Assistance Program and the ROTC model to solve the 
        primary care shortage by providing full-tuition scholarships to 
        students committed to serving the United States as primary care 
        doctors at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
