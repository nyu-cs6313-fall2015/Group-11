  <summary>6/13/2014--Introduced.
Department of Energy Research and Development Act of 2014 - Enabling Innovation for Science, Technology, and Energy in America Act of 2014 or the EINSTEIN Act - Authorizes and modified Department of Energy (DOE) programs related to science, basic research, and applied energy research and development. Authorizes appropriations for FY2014-FY2015 for these purposes.

Directs the DOE Office of Science to carry out research programs related to:

 basic energy sciences, including materials sciences and engineering, chemical sciences, physical biosciences, and geosciences; advanced scientific computing; high energy physics; biological and environmental research; fusion energy; and nuclear physics. Requires the Office of Science to carry out a program to improve the safety, efficiency, and mission readiness of infrastructure at its laboratories.

Directs the Secretary of Energy to make public specified details related to cost-share waivers, technology transfer agreements, and financial awards.

Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to set forth policies related to technology transfer activities.

Requires the Secretary to review all DOE science and technology activities and develop a plan to improve collaboration and coordination in research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities.

Directs DOE to carry out nuclear energy research and development, including research related to reactor concepts, small modular reactors, conventional improvements to nuclear power plants, and fuel cycles.</summary>
