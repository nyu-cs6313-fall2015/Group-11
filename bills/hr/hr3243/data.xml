  <summary>10/4/2013--Introduced.
Supporting Teachers and Enhancing Manufacturing (STEM) Jobs Act of 2013 - Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 to require the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish, as part of the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, a program awarding grants to partnerships between high-need local educational agencies (LEAs), their public schools, and institutions of higher education (IHEs) to provide fellowships to:

 science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) professionals (NSF Teaching Fellows) who are enrolled, in the fellowship's first year, in a master's degree program leading to teacher certification or licensing; and mathematics and science elementary and secondary school teachers (NSF Master Teaching Fellows) who have a master's degree in their field or possess the potential to become highly effective mathematics and science teachers and leaders in their respective schools. Requires the fellowship program to offer fellows: (1) the academic courses they need to earn a master's degree if they lack one, (2) the academic courses and leadership training they need to become master teachers in elementary and secondary schools if they already have a master's degree in education or their respective field, and (3) additional training programs that enable them to fulfill their service requirements.

Amends parts A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund) and B (Mathematics and Science Partnerships) of title II (Preparing, Training, and Recruiting High Quality Teachers and Principals) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to reauthorize appropriations under those parts for FY2014-FY2019.

Prohibits any single participant in a part A partnership (between IHEs and high-need LEAs) under part A from using more than 75% (currently 50%) of the partnership grant.</summary>
