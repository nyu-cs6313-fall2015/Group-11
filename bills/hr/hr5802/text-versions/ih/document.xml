			 in critical status within the meaning of section 305(b)(2) and whose plan
			 sponsor determines that the plan can not be reasonably expected to emerge
			 from critical status by the end of the rehabilitation period, such plan
			 may adopt rules providing for other terms and conditions for the
			 computation of an employer's withdrawal liability. Any such rule shall
			 become effective at the end of a 90-day period that begins on the date of
			 adoption of the rule unless the corporation disapproves the rule before
			 the end of the 90-day period (except that such 90-day period shall be
			 tolled during any period in which a request by the corporation for
			 additional information is pending). The corporation may disapprove a rule
			 under this subsection only if it reasonably determines that the rule
			 creates an unreasonable risk of loss to plan participants and
			 beneficiaries or to the corporation.</text>
