  <summary>12/5/2013--Introduced.
Public Access to Public Land Guarantee Act - Directs the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), with respect to land under their respective jurisdictions, pursuant to a state or local government offer, to enter into an agreement under which the United States may accept funds from the state or local government to reopen any unit of the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, or the National Forest System within the state or local government during any period in which there is a lapse in available funds for that unit as a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution.

Makes such authority effective only during a period in which the Secretary is unable to operate and manage covered units at normal levels.

Requires the appropriate Secretary to refund to the state or local government all amounts it provided to the United States under such an agreement: (1) upon enactment of an Act retroactively appropriating amounts sufficient to maintain normal operating levels at the reopened covered unit, or (2) on the date on which the state or local government establishes that the Secretary collected entrance or user fees for the covered units during the period in which the agreement was in effect.

Allows the appropriate Secretary, if such refund requirements are not met, to reimburse the state or local government voluntarily for any amounts it provided to the United States under such an agreement.</summary>
