Sets forth measures to expand the USAID program, including by establishment of a research and development program.\n\nAdds to the duties of the of the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally the coordination with HIV/AIDS activities of those relating to combatting NTDs, particularly in countries and regions that are highly endemic for female genital schistosomiasis.\n\nUrges the Secretary of State to: (1) engage the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in discussions of whether to expand the authority of the Fund for the control and elimination of NTDs; and (2) engage G-20 countries to significantly increase their role in the that effort, particularly Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa.\n\nRequires the President to direct the U.S. representatives to the United Nations and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to urge actions on NTDs, including deworming programs.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to:\n\n continue to promote the need for NTD programs and activities through interagency groups and international forums, report to Congress on NTDs in the United States, enter into cooperative agreements to support one or more centers of excellence for NTD research. Requires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to establish a panel to evaluate issues relating to worm infections, including potential solutions such as deworming medicines."
