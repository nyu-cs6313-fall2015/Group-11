  <summary>9/18/2014--Introduced.
You Own Devices Act - Amends federal copyright law to allow the owner of a machine or other product operated in any part by a computer program to transfer an authorized copy of the computer program, or the right to obtain such copy, when the owner sells, leases, or otherwise transfers the machine or product to another person. Prohibits such right to transfer the computer program from being waived by any agreement.

Requires any right to receive modifications to such a computer program relating to security or error correction that applied to the owner of the machine or product to apply to the person to whom the machine or product and the copy of the computer program are transferred.

Prohibits this Act from being construed to permit the owner to retain an unauthorized copy of the computer program after such a transfer.</summary>
