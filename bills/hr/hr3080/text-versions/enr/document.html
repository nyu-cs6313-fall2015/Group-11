    later than 3 years after the date of initiation;
        (2) have a maximum Federal cost of $3,000,000; and
        (3) ensure that personnel from the district, division, and 
    headquarters levels of the Corps of Engineers concurrently conduct 
    the review required under that section.
    (b) Extension.--If the Secretary determines that a feasibility 
study described in subsection (a) will not be conducted in accordance 
with subsection (a), the Secretary, not later than 30 days after the 
date of making the determination, shall--
        (1) prepare an updated feasibility study schedule and cost 
    estimate;
        (2) notify the non-Federal feasibility cost-sharing partner 
    that the feasibility study has been delayed; and
        (3) provide written notice to the Committee on Environment and

of Donald G. Waldon, whose selfless determination and tireless work, 
while serving as administrator of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway for 
21 years, contributed greatly to the realization and success of the 
Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Compact, that the lock and dam 
located at mile 357.5 on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway should be

SEC. 1051. INTERSTATE WATER AGREEMENTS AND COMPACTS.
    (a) Water Supply.--Section 301 of the Water Supply Act of 1958 (43 
U.S.C. 390b) (as amended by section 1046(d)) is amended by adding at 
the end the following:
    ``(f) The Committees of jurisdiction are very concerned about the 
operation of projects in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River 
System and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River System, and further, the 
Committees of jurisdiction recognize that this ongoing water resources 
dispute raises serious concerns related to the authority of the 
Secretary of the Army to allocate substantial storage at projects to 
provide local water supply pursuant to the Water Supply Act of 1958 
absent congressional approval. Interstate water disputes of this nature 
are more properly addressed through interstate water agreements that 
take into consideration the concerns of all affected States including 
impacts to other authorized uses of the projects, water supply for 
communities and major cities in the region, water quality, freshwater 
flows to communities, rivers, lakes, estuaries, and bays located 
downstream of projects, agricultural uses, economic development, and 
other appropriate concerns. To that end, the Committees of jurisdiction 
strongly urge the Governors of the affected States to reach agreement 
on an interstate water compact as soon as possible, and we pledge our 
commitment to work with the affected States to ensure prompt 
consideration and approval of any such agreement. Absent such action, 
the Committees of jurisdiction should consider appropriate legislation 
to address these matters including any necessary clarifications to the 
Water Supply Act of 1958 or other law. This subsection does not alter 
existing rights or obligations under law.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Interstate Water Agreements and 
Compacts.--
        (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (A) States and local interests have primary responsibility 
        for developing water supplies for domestic, municipal, 
        industrial, and other purposes.
            (B) The Federal Government cooperates with States and local 
        interests in developing water supplies through the 
        construction, maintenance, and operation of Federal water 
        resources development projects.
            (C) Interstate water disputes are most properly addressed 
        through interstate water agreements or compacts that take into 
        consideration the concerns of all affected States.
        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (A) Congress and the Secretary should urge States to reach 
        agreement on interstate water agreements and compacts;
            (B) at the request of the Governor of a State, the 
        Secretary should facilitate and assist in the development of an 
        interstate water agreement or compact;
            (C) Congress should provide prompt consideration of 
        interstate water agreements and compacts; and
            (D) the Secretary should adopt policies and implement 
        procedures for the operation of reservoirs of the Corps of 
        Engineers that are consistent with interstate water agreements 
        and compacts.
SEC. 1052. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
BILLS.
    It is the sense of Congress that, because the missions of the Corps 
of Engineers are unique and benefit all individuals in the United 
States and because water resources development projects are critical to 
maintaining economic prosperity, national security, and environmental 
protection, Congress should consider a water resources development bill 
not less than once every Congress.
