                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to provide assistance 
 for nutrient removal technologies to States in the Great Lakes System.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Nutrient Removal 
Assistance Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) ineffective wastewater treatment is one of the most 
        common sources of water pollution;
            (2) nutrient pollution, particularly phosphorus loading, 
        continues to be one of the most significant water quality 
        issues facing the Great Lakes System;
            (3) limiting phosphorus loads is key to controlling 
        excessive algal growth, and a coordinated Great Lakes System-
        wide strategy to change how nutrients are discharged is urgent; 
        and
            (4) nutrient removal technology is one of the most 
        reliable, cost effective, and direct methods for reducing the 
        flow of phosphorus and other harmful nutrients from point 
        sources in the Great Lakes System.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency to provide financial assistance to Great 
        Lakes States and municipalities for use in upgrading publically 
        owned wastewater treatment plants in the Great Lakes System 
        with nutrient removal technologies; and
            (2) to further the goal of restoring the water of the Great 
        Lakes System to conditions that are protective of human health 
        and aquatic life.

SEC. 3. SEWAGE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY GRANT PROGRAM.

    The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
