Requires each advisory group to: (1) collect and analyze data on the race and ethnicity of defendants at each stage of a criminal proceeding, (2) seek to determine causes of racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal justice process, and (3) submit to the U.S. attorney a report and proposed plan for addressing such disparities. Requires each U.S. attorney to annually evaluate the efficacy of a plan submitted by an advisory group.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to: (1) prepare a comprehensive report on all advisory group plans and submit such report and plans to Congress, and (2) exercise continuing oversight of the criminal justice system to reduce unwarranted racial and ethnic disparities and improve such system."
