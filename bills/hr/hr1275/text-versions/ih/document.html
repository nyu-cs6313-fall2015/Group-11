                                 A BILL


 
   To guarantee the right of individuals to receive Social Security 
  benefits under title II of the Social Security Act in full with an 
               accurate annual cost-of-living adjustment.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security Guarantee Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. GUARANTEE OF FULL SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WITH ACCURATE ANNUAL 
              COST-OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT.

    (a) In General.--On a date not later than 90 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall issue a 
benefit guarantee certificate to each individual who is determined by 
the Commissioner of Social Security as of such date to be entitled to 
benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et 
seq.). The Secretary shall also issue such a certificate to any 
individual on the date such individual is determined thereafter to be 
entitled to benefits under such title.
    (b) Benefit Guarantee Certificate.--The benefit guarantee 
certificate issued pursuant to subsection (a) shall represent a legally 
enforceable guarantee--
            (1) of the monthly amount of benefits to which the 
        individual is entitled under title II of the Social Security 
        Act (as in effect on the date of the issuance of the 
        certificate); and
            (2) that the benefits will be adjusted--
                    (A) not less frequently than annually on the basis 
                of an accurate determination of the increase in the 
                cost-of-living of the individual; and
                    (B) in accordance with such title (as so in 
                effect), to reflect any future changes in the 
                eligibility status of the individual under such title.
    (c) Entitlement.--Any certificate issued under the authority of 
this section constitutes budget authority in advance of appropriations 
Acts and represents the obligation of the Federal Government to provide 
for the payment to the individual to whom the certificate is issued 
benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et 
seq.) in the amounts set forth in the certificate and adjusted 
thereafter as described in subsection (b)(2).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
