 To adjust the boundary of the Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield 
  Park to include the Wallis House and Harriston Hill, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Kennesaw Mountain National 
Battlefield Park Boundary Adjustment Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park was 
        authorized as a unit of the National Park System on June 26, 
        1935. Prior to 1935, parts of the park had been acquired and 
        protected by Civil War veterans and the War Department.
            (2) Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park protects 
        Kennesaw Mountain and Kolb's Farm, which are battle sites along 
        the route of General Sherman's 1864 campaign to take Atlanta.
            (3) Most of the park protects Confederate positions and 
        strategy. The Wallis House is one of the few original 
        structures remaining from the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain 
        associated with Union positions and strategy.
            (4) The Wallis House is strategically located next to a 
        Union signal station at Harriston Hill.

National Battlefield Park is modified to include the approximately 8

    (b) Map.--The map referred to in subsection (a) shall be on file
