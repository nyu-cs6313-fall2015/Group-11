Commission--
            ``(1) shall consider whether the regulation is necessary or

        furtherance of the purposes of this section; and
            ``(5) shall include in the statement of basis and purpose

        burden on competition imposed by the regulation is necessary or 
        appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section.''.
