                Federal funds, in the amounts specified in Attachment 
                1, section 5, of the grant agreement;
                    (B) those State or other non-Federal funds are free 
                and clear of any legal challenge or other hindrance to 
                the expenditure of the funds by the Authority; and
                    (C) the funds are or will be available at the time 
                necessary to meet the Authority's financial obligations 
                as described in the grant agreement; or
            (2) September 30, 2017.
    (c) Changes to Agreement Prohibited.--Until the conditions 
described in subsection (b) have been met, the Federal Railroad 
Administration shall not amend, supplement, or otherwise change the 
terms of the grant agreement.
