        date of enactment of this Act; and

        Agriculture shall be considered to be a reference to the 
        Secretary.
    (b) Livestock.--The grazing of livestock in the Wilderness, if 
established before the date of enactment of this Act, is compatible 
with the Wilderness designation and shall continue, subject to such 
reasonable regulations, policies, and practices as the Secretary

            (1) section 4(d)(4) of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 
        1133(d)(4)); and
            (2) the guidelines set forth in Appendix A of the report of

        (House Report 101-405).
    (c) Adjacent Management.--

        designation of the Wilderness to create a protective perimeter 
        or buffer zone around the Wilderness.
            (2) Nonwilderness activities.--The fact that nonwilderness 
        activities or uses can be seen, heard, or detected from areas 
        within the Wilderness shall not preclude, limit, control, 
        regulate or determine the conduct or management of the

the control of fire, insects, and diseases (including, as the Secretary 
determines to be appropriate, the coordination of the activities with a 
State or local agency).
    (f) Wildfire Management Operations.--Nothing in this Act shall be 
construed to preclude a Federal, State, or local agency from conducting 
wildfire management or prevention operations (including operations 
using aircraft or mechanized equipment) or to interfere with the 
authority of the Secretary to authorize mechanical thinning of trees or 
underbrush to prevent or control the spread of wildfires or the use of 
mechanized equipment for wildfire pre-suppression and suppression.
    (g) Water Rights.--
            (1) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to protect the

        reserved water right.
            (2) Statutory construction.--Nothing in this title--
                    (A) constitutes an express or implied reservation

                in existence on the date of enactment of this Act;
                    (C) establishes a precedent with regard to any 
                future wilderness designations;
                    (D) affects the interpretation of, or any

                    (E) limits, alters, modifies, or amends any 
                interstate compact or equitable apportionment decree 
                that apportions water among and between the State and 
                other States.
            (3) Nevada water law.--The Secretary shall follow the 
        procedural and substantive requirements of State law in order

                occasional and temporary use of motorized vehicles if 
                the use, as determined by the Secretary, would promote 
                healthy, viable, and more naturally distributed 
                wildlife populations that would enhance wilderness 
                recreation with the minimal impact necessary to 
                reasonably accomplish those tasks, including but not 
                limited to, the hunting or culling of wildlife and 
                access for persons with disabilities.

    (d) Emergency Closures.--Nothing in this title prohibits a Federal 
land management agency from establishing or implementing emergency 
closures or restrictions of the smallest practicable area to provide 
for public safety, resource conservation, national security, or other

terminate after a reasonable period of time, but no longer than one

        and principles of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), 
        the Secretary may conduct any management activities in the

                        promote healthy, viable, and more naturally 
                        distributed wildlife populations that would 
                        enhance wilderness values with the minimal 
                        impact necessary to reasonably accomplish those

            (4) Emergency closures.--Nothing in this title prohibits a 
        Federal land management agency from establishing or 
        implementing emergency closures or restrictions of the smallest 
        practicable area to provide for public safety, resource 
        conservation, national security, or other purposes as 
        authorized by law. Such an emergency closure shall terminate

                regulations).
    (e) Wildlife Water Development Projects.--Subject to subsection 
(c), the Secretary shall authorize structures and facilities, including 
existing structures and facilities, for wildlife water development 
projects (including guzzlers) in the Wilderness if--
            (1) the structures and facilities will, as determined by 
        the Secretary, enhance wilderness values by promoting healthy, 
        viable, and more naturally distributed wildlife populations; 
        and
            (2) the visual impacts of the structures and facilities on
