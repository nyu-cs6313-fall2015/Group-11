			<paragraph id="H1822CA9124324532880C033CECB89442"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Consistent with Federal law and regulations, for law enforcement officers to qualify for premium
			 pay as criminal investigators, the officers must, in general, spend on
			 average at least 50 percent of their time investigating, apprehending, or
			 detaining individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the
			 criminal laws of the United States.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HB4AADF7B472E41118C24A3DF0B158764"><enum>(2)</enum><text>According to the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS IG), the
			 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) does not ensure that its
			 cadre of criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection are meeting
			 this requirement, even though they are considered law enforcement officers
			 under TSA policy and receive premium pay.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H13B452EFAF424FFCBDFE7196249D06C9"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Instead, TSA criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection primarily monitor the results of
			 criminal investigations conducted by other agencies, investigate
			 administrative cases of TSA employee misconduct, and carry out
			 inspections, covert tests, and internal reviews, which the DHS IG asserts
			 could be performed by employees other than criminal investigators at a
			 lower cost.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H22A89BC7BB3A47F2A2DBA0B7519FA573"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The premium pay and other benefits afforded to TSA criminal investigators in the Office of
			 Inspection who are incorrectly classified as such will cost the taxpayer
			 as much as $17,000,000 over 5 years if TSA fails to make any changes to
			 the number of criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection,
			 according to the DHS IG.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HB9F77F2237E74ED2A35DB4D8EBF5759A"><enum>(5)</enum><text>This may be a conservative estimate, as it accounts for the cost of Law Enforcement Availability
			 Pay, but not the costs of law enforcement training, statutory early
			 retirement benefits, police vehicles, and weapons.</text>
