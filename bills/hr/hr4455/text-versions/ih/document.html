                                 A BILL


 
To require Federal agencies to collaborate in the development of freely 
 available open source educational materials in college-level physics, 
              chemistry, and math, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Learning Opportunities With Creation 
of Open Source Textbooks (LOW COST) Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the College Board, that the average 
        student at a 4-year university spent an estimated $1,222 per 
        year on college books and supplies.
            (2) According to the National Association of College 
        Stores, the gross margin on new college textbooks was 25.6 
        percent in 2012.
            (3) The Government Accountability Office has found that 
        college textbook prices have risen at twice the rate of annual 
        inflation over the last two decades and that new textbook 
        prices increased 82 percent over the last decade.
            (4) An open source material project that would make high 
        quality educational materials freely available to the general 
        public would reduce college textbook costs and increase 
        accessibility to such education materials.
            (5) College-level open source course work materials in 
        math, physics, and chemistry represent a high-priority first 
        step in this area.
            (6) The scientific and technical workforce at Federal 
        agencies, national laboratories, and federally funded research 
        and development centers could make a valuable contribution to 
        this effort.
            (7) A Federal oversight role in the creation and 
        maintenance of standard, publicly vetted textbooks is desirable 
        to ensure that intellectual property is respected and that 
        public standards for quality, educational effectiveness, and 
        scientific accuracy are maintained.

SEC. 3. OPEN SOURCE MATERIAL PILOT PROGRAM.
