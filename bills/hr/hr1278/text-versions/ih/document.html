                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Trademark Act of 1946 regarding the disparagement of 
  Native American persons or peoples through marks that use the term 
                  ``redskin'', and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Non-Disparagement of Native American 
Persons or Peoples in Trademark Registration Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The use of the terms ``redskin'' and ``redskins'' in 
        trademarks is widely understood to refer to or imply a negative 
        reference to Native American persons or peoples, or both.
            (2) The term ``redskin'' has been demonstrated by 
        overwhelming linguistic and historical evidence to constitute a 
        disparaging epithet insulting to Native American persons or 
        peoples, or both.
            (3) Major Native American organizations, including the 
        National Congress of American Indians, the National Indian 
        Education Association, the Native American Journalists 
        Association, the Native American Rights Fund, the Morning Star 
        Institute, the International Indian Treaty Council, and the 
        National Indian Youth Council, have opposed the continued use 
        of the term ``redskin'' in trademarks or as the name of sports 
        teams.
            (4) Recent psychological evidence has demonstrated the 
        general negative effects associated with references in sports 
        to Native American people.
            (5) Trademarks containing the term ``redskin'', or any 
        derivation of the term, should not continue to enjoy the 
        benefits of Federal registration.

SEC. 3. REFERENCES TO TRADEMARK ACT OF 1946.

    In this Act, the term ``Trademark Act of 1946'' means the Act 
entitled ``An Act to provide for the registration and protection of 
trademarks used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain 
international conventions, and for other purposes'', approved July 5, 
1946 (commonly referred to as the ``Lanham Act''; 15 U.S.C. 1051 et

shall be conclusively presumed to consist of matter which may disparage 
persons if (1) the mark has been, is, or is intended to be used in 
commerce in connection with references to or images of one or more 
Native American persons or peoples, or to Native American persons or 
peoples in general; or (2) the Director determines that the term as 
included in the mark is commonly understood to refer to one or more 
Native Americans persons or peoples, or to Native American persons or
