  <summary>7/16/2014--Introduced.
Department of Energy Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act of 2014 - Amends the Department of Energy Organization Act to rename the Under Secretary for Science as the Under Secretary for Science and Energy.

Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to report on DOE's ability to improve the technology transfer and commercialization of energy technologies.

Directs the Secretary to carry out the Agreements for Commercializing Technology pilot program in accordance with this Act, including by giving the contractors of the national laboratories increased authority to negotiate contract terms and making every National Laboratory eligible for the program. Extends the pilot program for two years.

Requires the Secretary to delegate to the directors of the national laboratories signature authority with respect to specified agreements of less than $1 million.

 Permits the directors of national laboratories to use funds authorized to support technology transfer within DOE to carry out early-stage and pre-commercial technology demonstration activities to: (1) remove technology barriers that limit private sector interest, and (2) demonstrate potential commercial applications of any research and technologies arising from national laboratory activities.

Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to exempt institutions of higher education and nonprofit institutions from the cost-sharing requirements for research or development for six years.

Authorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to enable the participation of DOE researchers in the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps program.

Requires a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</summary>
