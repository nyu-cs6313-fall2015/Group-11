American Manufacturing Jobs for Students Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education, when awarding grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for school counseling programs, to give special consideration to coordinated efforts to significantly engage students in manufacturing careers.

 Requires such programs to provide students in grades 7-12 with: (1) information on career and educational pathways leading to jobs and career opportunities in the LEA's geographic area, particularly in the manufacturing field; and (2) opportunities to interact with employers in the LEA's geographic area, with preference given to employers in the manufacturing field.</summary>
