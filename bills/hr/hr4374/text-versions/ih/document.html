    (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 73 of title 38, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 7330B. Identification and tracking of biological implants
    ``(a) Standard Identification System for Biological Implants.--The 
Secretary shall adopt the unique device identification system developed 
for medical devices by the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to 
section 519(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
360i(f)), or implement a comparable standard identification system, for

procedures conducted in medical facilities of the Department.
    ``(b) Biological Implant Tracking System.--(1) The Secretary shall 
implement a system for tracking the biological implants referred to in 
subsection (a) from donor to implantation. Such system shall be 
compatible with the identification system adopted or implemented under 
subsection (a).
    ``(2) The Secretary shall implement inventory controls compatible 
with the tracking system implemented under paragraph (1) so that all

evaluation of appropriate medical personnel of the Department of the 
risks and benefits, the Secretary determines such notification is 
appropriate.
    ``(c) Consistency With Food and Drug Administration Regulations.--
