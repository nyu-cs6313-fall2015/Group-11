    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Our Public Lands Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITING HYDRAULIC FRACTURING UNDER FEDERAL LEASES.

    The Mineral Leasing Act is amended by inserting after section 37 
(30 U.S.C. 193) the following:

``SEC. 38. NO HYDRAULIC FRACTURING ON LEASED LAND.

    ``(a) In General.--Any lease issued, renewed, or readjusted under 
this Act shall prohibit the lessee from conducting any activity under 
the lease for the purpose of hydraulic fracturing.
    ``(b) Definition of Hydraulic Fracturing.--In this section, the 
term `hydrauling fracturing' means an operation conducted in an 
individual wellbore designed to increase the flow of hydrocarbons from 
a rock formation to the wellbore through modifying the permeability of 
reservoir rock by fracturing it, except that such term does not include 
enhanced secondary recovery, including water flooding, tertiary 
recovery, and other types of well stimulation operations.''.

SEC. 3. APPLICATION.

    The amendment made by section 2 shall not apply to a lease in 
effect on the date of the enactment of this Act until the renewal or 
adjustment of the lease.
