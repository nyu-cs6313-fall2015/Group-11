                                 AN ACT


 
    To provide for the use of savings promotion raffle products by 
  financial institutions to encourage savings, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Savings Promotion Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the annual savings rate in the United States was 4.1 
        percent in 2012;
            (2) more than 40 percent of American households lack the 
        savings to cover basic expenses for 3 months, if an unexpected 
        event leads to a loss of stable income;
            (3) personal savings provide Americans with the financial 
        resources to meet future needs, including higher education and 
        homeownership, while also providing a safety net to weather 
        unexpected financial shocks;
            (4) prize-linked savings products are typical savings 
        products offered by financial institutions, like savings 
        accounts, certificates of deposit, and savings bonds, with the 
        added feature of offering chances to win prizes based on 
        deposit activity;
            (5) the State of Michigan was the first State to allow 
        credit unions to offer prize-linked savings products, and in 
        2009 launched the first large-scale prize-linked savings 
        product in the United States;
            (6) the States of Connecticut, Michigan, Maine, Maryland, 
        Nebraska, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Washington all have 
        laws that allow financial institutions to offer prize-linked 
        savings products;
            (7) in the States of Michigan and Nebraska, more than 
        42,000 individuals have opened prize-linked savings accounts 
        and saved more than $72,000,000;
            (8) prize-linked savings products have been shown to 
        successfully attract non-savers, the asset poor, and low-to-
        moderate income groups, providing individuals with a new tool 
        to build personal savings; and
            (9) encouraging personal savings is in the national 
        interest of the United States.
