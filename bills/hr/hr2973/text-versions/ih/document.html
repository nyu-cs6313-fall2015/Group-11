                                 A BILL


 
   To authorize the Secretary of Interior to carry out projects and 
 conduct research on water resources in the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin, 
  to establish a Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Commission, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Hudson-Mohawk River Basin Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin together with the Erie 
        Canal connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean and 
        includes the 13,400 square mile area encompassing five large 
        sub-basins: the Upper Hudson River sub-basin, the Mohawk River 
        sub-basin, the Lower Hudson River sub-basin, the Passaic River 
        sub-basin, and the Raritan River sub-basin.
            (2) The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin played an essential role 
        in the birth of our Nation and its westward expansion. The 
        water of the Hudson-Mohawk Basin is the ink used to write the 
        early United States history of European settlement and the 
        American Revolution. The Basin's rivers served as a major 
        transportation corridor connecting the communities along it 
        from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes.
            (3) The Hudson-Mohawk River Basin includes the largest 
        metropolitan area of the country: the New York-New Jersey 
        metropolitan area. This metropolitan area, together with the 
        many communities in the Upper Hudson, Mohawk, and Lower Hudson 
        sub-basins, makes the area one of the most densely and heavily 
        populated river basins in the country with over 15,000,000 
        people.
            (4) The water resources of the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin 
        are functionally interrelated and their uses are 
        interdependent. A single entity is essential to provide 
        effective communication, coordination, and cooperation among 
        Federal, State, and local governments, non-governmental 
        organizations, and the private sector for this area.
            (5) The New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary is a complex 
        natural harbor at the junction of three major water bodies, the 
        New York Bight, the Hudson River and the Long Island Sound. In 
        addition, it receives freshwater inputs from the Raritan and 
        Passaic Rivers. The health and productivity of the New York 
        Bight is affected directly by the quality of the freshwater 
        inputs to the estuary from the Hudson, Passaic, and Raritan 
        Rivers.
            (6) The headwaters of the Hudson originate within the 
        Adirondack Mountains, a treasured northeastern wilderness area, 
        protected under the New York State constitution since 1894. The 
        Hudson's path south through the Hudson River Highlands, and the 
        Mohawk's path south east to its junction with the Hudson, 
        provides the only natural break in the Appalachian Mountain 
        chain.
            (7) The Mohawk Valley's abundant natural resources, and 
        fertile floodplain soils provided a rich endowment that first 
        supported the Mohawk nation and the Iroquois Confederacy and 
        later supported European settlement and the development of 
        industry and commerce.
            (8) The Mohawk River and its watershed drain directly into 
        the Hudson River providing the largest freshwater input to the 
        brackish water mix that characterizes the Hudson River Estuary 
        and supports a biologically rich and productive ecosystem.
            (9) The Mohawk River is integrated with the Erie Canal 
        along much of its channel. Therefore, tying the operation of 
        the Canal system to the health of the Mohawk and the Hudson 
        Rivers.
            (10) Individuals in many communities throughout the Basin 
        have experienced devastating flooding that led to tremendous 
        costs for businesses, State, and local governments. A holistic 
        approach to river and stream monitoring, updated floodplain 
        maps, and development of floodplain management strategies based 
        upon improved understanding of the Basin's hydrology would make 
        communities safer and more resistant and resilient to flood 
        events.
            (11) Climate change is occurring and, as a result, sea 
        level rise along the United States eastern coastline will 
        increase the vulnerability of coastal communities to storm 
        surge and flooding in the New York-New Jersey harbors and along 
        the major rivers in the Basin.
            (12) Each of the subwatersheds of the Hudson-Mohawk River 
        Basin receives support of programs administered by Federal, 
        State, regional, and local organizations.
            (13) There has been little integration of planning and 
        program implementation to address the Hudson-Mohawk River Basin 
        in a holistic manner.
            (14) New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, and 
        Connecticut have a long history of achievements working 
        together on resource management issues through their 
        memberships in the Delaware River Basin Commission, the 
        Susquehanna River Basin Commission, the Appalachian Regional 
        Commission, the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control 
        Commission, and the Lake Champlain Basin Program.
            (15) The basin-wide impacts experienced as a result of 
        recent hurricanes and storms illustrate the need for 
        integrated, basin-wide planning to address water management 
        challenges and vulnerability to flooding.
            (16) Protection and restoration of wetlands, expanded use 
        of green infrastructure, strengthening of dams and levees, and 
        upgrading of wastewater and water treatment infrastructure will 
        be necessary to reduce the impacts of extreme weather events 
        and maintain water quality and public health.
            (17) Development and implementation of projects to control 
        flooding and improve water quality must be done with the full 
        participation of local communities and citizens, address the 
        needs they identify, and be conducted in a manner that respects 
        private property and is consistent with the authorities of 
        state and local jurisdictions.

period in each of the five sub-basins. The water resources program 
shall include a systematic presentation for each of the five sub-basins 
of--
            (1) the specific needs to be addressed by the water 
        resources program;
