			<paragraph id="H3F05995628474020A3CDA15408CF7E98"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The Federal Government holds a vast repository of public information. Throughout the Nation’s
			 history, the Government has attempted to make that information available
			 to the public, whether through the United States Postal Service, the
			 Federal Depository Library Program, the Presidential Library System,
			 Agency Reading Rooms, under the Freedom of Information Act, or by other
			 means. Providing this information to the general public is a public good:
			 informed citizens are informed voters. However, even with these efforts,
			 Government information is too often hard to find, difficult to understand,
			 expensive to obtain in useful formats, and available in only a few
			 locations.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H17CAA6905A4A45A88CE48E519CA429C3"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The advent of the Internet presents the opportunity for the Government to make information readily
			 available to many more Americans. The Internet is ubiquitous, turning
			 every computer into a portal to the world’s largest library. The
			 Government has made some efforts to take advantage of this new medium. As
			 the public moves online, the Government must do so as well.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HE922E988AE1A43218EF4D7A6BC5888D7"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In addition to the traditional means of disseminating public information, the Federal Government
			 should make all of its public information available on the Internet. It
			 should do so in ways that take advantage of modern technology, that
			 anticipate the public’s needs, and that provide access to the greatest
			 number of people. The Government should strive to make its information
			 available on the Internet in real-time and in machine processable formats.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0FFF82BA4B4D45FAA3A3112C341049E8"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The creation of this vast new information library will empower citizens to gain a better
			 understanding of how their Government functions and what it does in their
			 name. It will also give innovators new tools to build on this information
			 and provide better goods and services to the American people. Government
			 services will be provided more efficiently, saving the taxpayers money and
			 allowing them to be more involved in the lives of their communities.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HAFF58DA1785B413EB6C04EA9C7713A7D"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Accomplishing these goals requires significant coordination. It also requires the creation of new
			 authorities and responsibilities within the Government, and the
			 identification of appropriate technology standards.</text>
