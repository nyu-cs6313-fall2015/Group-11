                than 130 free-roaming wild horses in and around such 
                refuge, with a target population of between 120 and 130 
                free-roaming wild horses;
                    (B) provide for cost-effective management of the 
                horses while ensuring that natural resources within the 
                refuge are not adversely impacted;
                    (C) provide for introduction of a small number of 
                free-roaming wild horses from the herd at Cape Lookout 
                National Seashore as is necessary to maintain the 
                genetic viability of the herd in and around the 
                Currituck National Wildlife Refuge; and
                    (D) specify that the Corolla Wild Horse Fund shall 
                pay the costs associated with--
                            (i) coordinating a periodic census and 
                        inspecting the health of the horses;
                            (ii) maintaining records of the horses 
                        living in the wild and in confinement;
                            (iii) coordinating the removal and 
                        placement of horses and monitoring of any

                            (iv) administering a viable population 
                        control plan for the horses including auctions, 
                        adoptions, contraceptive fertility methods, and 
                        other viable options.
    (b) Requirements for Introduction of Horses From Cape Lookout 
National Seashore.--During the effective period of the memorandum of 
understanding between the National Park Service and the Foundation for 
Shackleford Horses, Inc. (a non-profit corporation organized under the

        successor agreement) and the Management Plan for the 
        Shackleford Banks Horse Herd signed in January 2006 (or any 
        successor management plan).
    (c) No Liability Created.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as creating liability for the United States for any damages 
caused by the free-roaming wild horses to any person or property 
located inside or outside the boundaries of the refuge.

            Passed the House of Representatives June 3, 2013.
