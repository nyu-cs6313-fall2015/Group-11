            United States located within the United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Life, Liberty, and Justice for All 
Americans Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON USE OF LETHAL MILITARY FORCE AGAINST CITIZENS OF 
              THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Prohibition.--The President may not use lethal military force 
against a citizen of the United States who is located in the United 
States.
    (b) Exception.--The prohibition under subsection (a) shall not 
apply to the President using lethal military force against an 
individual if the President determines that--
            (1) the individual poses an imminent threat of death or 
        serious bodily injury to another individual; and
            (2) using such force will prevent or minimize such deaths 
        or serious bodily injuries.
    (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
suggest that the Constitution would otherwise allow the killing of a 
citizen of the United States without due process of law.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``lethal military force'' means a targeted 
        killing or other lethal action by the Federal Government that 
        is typically used against an enemy of the United States, 
        including through the use of an unmanned aircraft or other 
        aircraft, regardless of the department or agency carrying out 
        the targeted killing or other action.
            (2) The term ``serious bodily injury'' has the meaning 
        given that term in section 1365(h)(3) of title 18, United 
        States Code.
            (3) The term ``United States'', as used in a territorial 
        sense, has the meaning given that term in section 5 of title 
        18, United States Code.
            (4) The term ``unmanned aircraft'' has the meaning given 
        that term in section 331(8) of the FAA Modernization and Reform 
        Act of 2012 (49 U.S.C. 40101 note).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
