carried out only with the full and informed consent of the patient or, 
in appropriate cases, a representative thereof.
    ``(2) The Secretary may waive the requirement for informed consent 
under paragraph (1) with respect to the visual recording of a patient 
if such recording is made--
            ``(A) pursuant to a determination by a physician or 
        psychologist that such recording is medically necessary or 
        necessary for the safety of the patient;
            ``(B) pursuant to a warrant or order of a court of 
        competent jurisdiction; or
            ``(C) in a public setting where a person would not have a 
        reasonable expectation to privacy, such as a waiting room or 
        hallway, and such recording is for general security purposes 
        not particularized to the patient.
    ``(3) In this subsection, the term `visual recording' means the 
recording or transmission of images or video, but does not include--
            ``(A) medical imaging, including such imaging produced by
