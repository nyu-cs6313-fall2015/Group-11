 To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to facilitate retransmission 
    consent negotiations between television broadcast stations and 
    multichannel video programming distributors, to provide greater 
   subscriber choice in cable service tiers, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Video Consumers Have Options in 
Choosing Entertainment Act of 2013'' or the ``Video CHOICE Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. CARRIAGE DURING RETRANSMISSION CONSENT NEGOTIATION IMPASSE.

    Section 325(b)(3) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(3)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(D) If a negotiation for a replacement or extended retransmission 
consent agreement between a television broadcast station and a 
multichannel video programming distributor reaches an impasse that 
results in the expiration of the carriage rights of the multichannel 
video programming distributor, the Commission may, notwithstanding 
paragraph (1)(A), authorize interim carriage of such station by such 
distributor pending the conclusion of a new agreement.''.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF AGREEMENTS CONDITIONED ON CARRIAGE OF AFFILIATED 
              PROGRAMMING.

    (a) In General.--Section 325(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 
(47 U.S.C. 325(b)) is amended by redesignating paragraph (7) as 
paragraph (8) and inserting after paragraph (6) the following:
    ``(7) A television broadcast station that elects to exercise its 
right to grant retransmission consent under this subsection may not 
enter into a retransmission consent agreement with a multichannel video 
programming distributor that is directly or indirectly conditioned on 
carriage of any other programming affiliated with such station (or with 
a person who owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under 
common ownership or control with such station).''.
    (b) No Effect on Prior Agreements.--The amendment made by 
subsection (a) shall apply with respect to retransmission consent 
agreements entered into after the date of the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 4. RULEMAKING ON BLOCKING OF ONLINE CONTENT DURING NEGOTIATIONS.

    Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Federal Communications Commission shall complete a rulemaking 
proceeding to determine whether, during retransmission consent 
negotiations or after the parties to such negotiations reach an impasse 
resulting in the expiration of an existing retransmission consent 
agreement, the blocking of online content owned by or affiliated with a 
television broadcast station (or a person who owns or controls, is 
owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with 
such station) constitutes a failure to negotiate in good faith under 
section 325(b)(3)(C)(ii) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 
325(b)(3)(C)(ii)).

SEC. 5. CABLE SERVICE TIERS.

                broadcast station electing retransmission consent under 
                section 325(b) that is carried on the cable system.

                under this Act to the same extent as the basic service 
                tier described in paragraph (7).''.
            (2) Prohibition on certain bundling.--Section 623(b)(8)(A) 
        of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 543(b)(8)(A)) is

                subscribers with regard to the rates charged for--
                            ``(i) video programming offered on a per 
                        channel or per program basis; or
                            ``(ii) the retransmission consent service 
                        tier described in paragraph (9).''.
            (3) Conforming amendment.--Section 623(a)(2)(A) of the

and national television sports networks in the top 20 regional sports 
markets, as determined by the Commission.
