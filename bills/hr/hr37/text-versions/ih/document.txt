                  TITLE II--SAVINGS AND SPENDING CUTS

SEC. 201. STREAMLINE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Partially as a result of unnecessary Federal spending, 
        the United States national debt is over $15 trillion.
            (2) Bureaucratic complexity and redundancy waste time and 
        money for consumers, businesses, and taxpayers.
            (3) In March 2011, the Government Accountability Office 
        released a report entitled ``Opportunities to Reduce Potential 
        Duplication in Government Programs, Save Tax Dollars, and 
        Enhance Revenue'' that identifies areas where greater 
        efficiencies could be found in Government operations. Some of 
        the findings include:
                    (A) Seven different Federal agencies have programs 
                dedicated to meeting the water needs in the United 
                States-Mexico border region.
                    (B) There are 82 Federal programs dedicated to 
                improving teacher quality.
                    (C) There are 56 programs in 20 different Federal 
                agencies designed to target financial literacy.
                    (D) There are 80 Federal programs to boost 
                transportation opportunities for disadvantaged 
                individuals.
                    (E) There are over 20 programs in seven different 
                Federal agencies working to combat homelessness.
            (4) The Department of Commerce's core business and trade 
        functions, the Small Business Administration, the Office of the 
        United States Trade Representative, the Export-Import Bank, the 
        Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the United States 
        Trade and Development Agency all serve important, but sometimes 
        overlapping functions for consumers and businesses in the 
        United States. Consolidating these agencies could save $3 
        billion and eliminate over 1,000 duplicative Federal jobs while 
        improving the service provided to taxpayers and consumers.
            (5) The Federal Government provides important services that 
        can be improved while saving money by consolidating and 
        reforming Federal agencies.
    (b) Consolidation Authority.--
            (1) Efficiency-enhancing plan defined.--Section 902 of 
        title 5, United States Code, is amended--
                    (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' after the 
                semicolon;
                    (B) in paragraph (3), by striking the period and 
                inserting ``; and''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(4) `efficiency-enhancing plan' means a reorganization 
        plan that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
        determines will result in, or is likely to result in--
                    ``(A) a decrease in the number of agencies; and
                    ``(B) cost savings in performing the functions that 
                are the subject of that plan.''.
            (2) Modernizing reorganization authority.--Section 
        905(a)(1) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by 
        striking the following: ``or renaming an existing executive 
        department, abolishing or transferring an executive department 
        or independent regulatory agency, or all the functions thereof, 
        or consolidating two or more executive departments or two or 
        more independent regulatory agencies, or all the functions 
        thereof''.
    (c) Duration and Scope of Authority.--
            (1) In general.--Section 905(b) of title 5, United States 
        Code, is amended by striking ``if the plan'' and all that 
        follows and inserting the following: ``if the plan is--
            ``(1) transmitted to Congress (in accordance with section 
        903(b)) on or before the date that is 2 years after the date of 
        the enactment of the Business and Government Operations 
        Improvement Act; and
            ``(2) an efficiency-enhancing plan.''.
            (2) Exercise of rulemaking power.--Section 908(1) of title 
        5, United States Code, is amended by striking ``December 31, 
        1984'' and inserting ``the date that is 2 years after the date 
        of the enactment of the Business and Government Operations 
        Improvement Act''.

SEC. 202. CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDING 
              $100,000,000.

    (a) Approval Requirement.--No Federal department or agency may 
enter into a contract with, award a grant to, or guarantee a loan for, 
a private entity in excess of $100,000,000 for a fiscal year, unless

of such contract, grant, or guarantee, and such approval is 
subsequently granted by enactment of a joint resolution.
    (b) Expedited Consideration.--A joint resolution of approval under 
subsection (a) shall be considered in the House of Representatives and 
the Senate not later then 30 days after the date of submission of a 
request under such subsection, under expedited procedures.
    (c) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on the date 
that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.

Activities.--The Administrator shall not award any grant, contract, 
cooperative agreement, or other financial assistance under this section 
for any program, project, or activity to occur outside the United 
States and its territories and possessions.''.

              AND LEASED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

    (a) Review of Nonessential Vehicle Purchase.--The Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the head of the 
relevant Executive agency, shall complete each of the following:
            (1) Determine the total dollar amount obligated by each 
        Executive agency to purchase civilian vehicles in fiscal year 
        2010.
