United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Electric Transportation Advancement 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are to enhance the energy security of the 
United States, reduce dependence on imported oil, improve the energy 
efficiency of the transportation sector, and reduce emissions through 
the expansion of grid supported transportation, through programs to--
            (1) develop, with industry, research institutions, National 
        Laboratories, and institutions of higher education, projects to 
        foster--
                    (A) the commercialization of plug-in electric drive 
                vehicle technology for various sizes and applications 
                of vehicles; and
