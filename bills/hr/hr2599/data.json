Defines an \"eligible individual\" as an inmate who was enrolled before being incarcerated or who is diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus. Provides for a one-year increase in federal matching payments to states that agree to provide for such enrollment.\n\nDirects the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct an annual survey of all federal and state correctional facilities and immigration detention facilities regarding: (1) STI prevention education and training offered to inmates and staff; (2) inmate access to sexual barrier protection devices; (3) the incidence of sexual violence committed by inmates and staff; (4) required inmate participation in counseling, treatment, and supportive services related to STIs; (5) facility testing of inmates for STIs; (6) pre-release referral to STI-related services; and (7) Medicaid reinstatement assistance upon release.\n\nRequires the Attorney General to develop and implement a five-year strategy that includes specified components to reduce the prevalence and spread of STIs in federal and state correctional facilities.\n\nAmends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to include as a homeless person for purposes of eligibility for housing assistance under such Act an individual who: (1) is being released from any prison or other correctional facility, and (2) has been diagnosed with any STI."
