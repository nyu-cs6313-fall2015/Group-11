                subsection (b) to that of an alien lawfully admitted

                        year after the date of the enactment of this

                        immigrant visa and admissible to the United 
                        States for permanent residence, except that, in 
                        determining such admissibility, the grounds for 
                        inadmissibility specified in paragraphs (4),

                    (B) Ineligible aliens.--An alien shall not be 
                eligible for adjustment of status under this section if 
                the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the 
                alien--
                            (i) has been convicted of any aggravated 
                        felony (as defined in section 101(a)(43) of the 
                        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
                        1101(a)(43)));
                            (ii) has been convicted of 2 or more crimes 
                        involving moral turpitude; or
                            (iii) has ordered, incited, assisted, or 
                        otherwise participated in the persecution of 
                        any person on account of race, religion, 
                        nationality, membership in a particular social 
                        group, or political opinion.
            (2) Relationship of application to certain orders.--
                    (A) In general.--An alien present in the United 
                States who has been subject to an order of exclusion, 
                deportation, or removal, or has been ordered to depart 
                voluntarily from the United States under any provision 
                of the Immigration and Nationality Act may, 
                notwithstanding such order, apply for adjustment of 
                status under paragraph (1) if otherwise qualified under 
                such paragraph.
                    (B) Separate motion not required.--An alien 
                described in subparagraph (A) may not be required, as a 
                condition of submitting or granting such application, 
                to file a separate motion to reopen, reconsider, or 
                vacate the order described in subparagraph (A).
                    (C) Effect of decision by secretary.--If the 
                Secretary of Homeland Security adjusts the status of an 
                alien pursuant to an application under paragraph (1), 
                the Secretary shall cancel the order described in 
                subparagraph (A). If the Secretary of Homeland Security 
                makes a final decision to deny such adjustment of 
                status, the order shall be effective and enforceable to 
                the same extent as if the application had not been 
                made.
    (b) Aliens Eligible for Adjustment of Status.--
            (1) In general.--The benefits provided under subsection (a) 
        shall apply to any alien--
                    (A) who is--
                            (i) a national of Liberia; and
                            (ii) has been continuously present in the 
                        United States between January 1, 2013, and the 
                        date on which the alien submits an application 
                        under subsection (a); or
                    (B) who is the spouse, child, or unmarried son or 
                daughter of an alien described in subparagraph (A).
            (2) Determination of continuous physical presence.--For 
        purposes of establishing the period of continuous physical 
        presence referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), an alien shall 
        not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous 
        physical presence by reasons of an absence, or absences, from 
        the United States for any period or periods amounting in the 
        aggregate to not more than 180 days.
    (c) Stay of Removal.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
        establish procedures, by regulation, through which an alien, 
        who is subject to a final order of deportation, removal, or 
        exclusion, may seek a stay of such order based upon the filing 
        of an application under subsection (a).
            (2) During certain proceedings.--Notwithstanding any 
        provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 
        et seq.), the Secretary of Homeland Security may not order an 
        alien to be removed from the United States if the alien is in 
        exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings under any 
        provision of such Act and has applied for adjustment of status 
        under subsection (a) unless the Secretary of Homeland Security 
        has made a final determination to deny the application.
            (3) Work authorization.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security 
                may--
                            (i) authorize an alien who has applied for 
                        adjustment of status under subsection (a) to 
                        engage in employment in the United States while 
                        a determination regarding such application is 
                        pending; and
                            (ii) provide the alien with an ``employment 
                        authorized'' endorsement or other appropriate 
                        document signifying authorization of 
                        employment.
                    (B) Pending applications.--If an application for 
                adjustment of status under subsection (a) is pending 
                for a period exceeding 180 days and has not been 
                denied, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
                authorize such employment.
    (d) Record of Permanent Residence.--Upon the approval of an alien's 
application for adjustment of status under subsection (a), the 
Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish a record of the alien's 
admission for permanent residence as of the date of the alien's arrival 
in the United States.
    (e) Availability of Administrative Review.--The Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall provide to applicants for adjustment of status 
under subsection (a) the same right to, and procedures for, 
administrative review as are provided to--
            (1) applicants for adjustment of status under section 245 
        of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255); and
            (2) aliens subject to removal proceedings under section 240 
        of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1229a).

Secretary of Homeland Security regarding the adjustment of status of 
any alien under this section is final and shall not be subject to 
review by any court.
    (g) No Offset in Number of Visas Available.--If an alien is granted 
the status of having been lawfully admitted for permanent residence 
pursuant to this section, the Secretary of State shall not be required 
to reduce the number of immigrant visas authorized to be issued under 
any provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et 
seq.).

            (2) Savings provision.--Nothing in this Act may be

        the powers, duties, function, or authority of the Secretary of 
        Homeland Security in the administration and enforcement of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act or any other law relating to 
        immigration, nationality, or naturalization.
            (3) Effect of eligibility for adjustment of status.--
        Eligibility to be granted the status of having been lawfully 
        admitted for permanent residence under this section shall not 
        preclude an alien from seeking any status under any other 
        provision of law for which the alien may otherwise be eligible.
