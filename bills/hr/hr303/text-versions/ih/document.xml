			 within cost constraints, Congress effectively has authorized full concurrent
			 receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100-percent disability ratings and all
			 qualifying retirees with combat-related disability ratings, while phasing out
			 the disability offset to retired pay over 10 years for retired members with
			 noncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 percent to 90
			 percent.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="HEACFE8AC5F2F47BFBF19478F42A16736"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In pursuing these
