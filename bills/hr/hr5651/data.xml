  <summary>9/18/2014--Introduced.
Small Business Hardship Relief Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt from the employer mandate to provide minimum essential health care coverage for its employees a small business (i.e., an employer of not more than 100&#160;full-time employees)&#160;experiencing a hardship. Defines "hardship" to include situations in which a small business has missed two or more consecutive&#160;loan payments, is a debtor in a Chapter 11 (reorganization) bankruptcy proceeding,&#160;has received a notice of termination of utility services or a notice of eviction, has experienced a fire, flood, or other disaster, or has&#160;experienced another hardships as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study to identify additional hardships appropriate for granting an hardship exemption.

Prohibits the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from&#160;taking into account&#160;the applicability of a hardship exemption to a small business&#160;as the sole factor in determining whether to audit such business.</summary>
