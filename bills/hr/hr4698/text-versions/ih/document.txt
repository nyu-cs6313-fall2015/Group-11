SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF RECOVERY IN CERTAIN WRONGFUL LIFE AND WRONGFUL 
              BIRTH CIVIL ACTIONS.

    (a) General Rule.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, a 
person may not recover damages in any designated civil action (as 
defined in subsection (d)) based on a claim that, but for the conduct 
of the defendant, a child, once conceived, would not or should not have 
been born.
    (b) Application to Certain Claims.--Subsection (a) applies, among 
others, to a claim based in whole or in part on disability, defect, 
abnormality, race, sex, or other inborn characteristic of the child.
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Subsection (a) shall not be construed--
            (1) to provide a defense against charges of intentional 
        misrepresentation in any proceeding under State law regulating 
        the professional practices of health care providers and 
        practitioners;
            (2) to provide a defense in any criminal action, including 
        cases of rape or incest; or
            (3) to limit the recovery of damages in cases where the 
        conduct of the defendant caused personal injury or death to the 
        child or gestational mother.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section--
            (1) the term ``State'' includes the District of Columbia, 
        the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any other territory or 
        possession of the United States; and
            (2) the term ``designated civil action'' means a civil 
        action, in Federal or State court--
                    (A) arising under Federal law; or
                    (B) based on a claim involving health care services 
                affecting interstate or foreign commerce.
                                 <all>
