                                 A BILL


 
    To require accountability in the Veterans Health Administration.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Health Accountability 
Act''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that in light of the Veterans Health 
Administration's continued delays in providing emergency and other 
serious health care to the Nation's veterans, there needs to be more 
accountability to prevent this situation from occurring in the future.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    ``Timely basis'' shall be one day for procedures and seven calendar 
days for tests.

SEC. 4. GENERAL AUTHORIZATION.

    The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall provide a voucher, the 
value of which shall be the market price for the needed service, for 
use at non-Veterans' Administration facilities for any veteran who has 
been denied healthcare on a timely basis at any Veterans' 
Administration facility.
    If more than ten percent of the Veterans Health Administration's 
budget goes towards the health vouchers, then all veterans shall be 
eligible for Veterans' Administration-paid care from non-Veterans' 
Administration facilities and the Secretary of the Veterans' 
Administration shall immediately prepare for the privatization of all 
Veterans' Administration facilities to be completed within one calendar 
year.
                                 <all>
