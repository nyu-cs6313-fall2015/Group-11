                and evaluation before providing a veterinary 
                prescription, but only if the prescriber requires 
                immediate payment in the case of an examination that 
                reveals no requirement for an animal drug.

SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT.

Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)). The Federal 
Trade Commission shall enforce this Act in the same manner, by the same
