  <summary>9/18/2014--Introduced.
Protecting Our Kids' Medicine Act of 2014 - Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the sale of liquid formulations of over-the-counter drugs that are not packaged with a dosage delivery device, such as a calibrated cup or spoon, and that do not have measurements on the label and on the dosage delivery device exclusively in metric units. Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to waive the requirement for metric units if that requirement would not benefit public health.

Prohibits the sale of over-the-counter liquid drugs labeled for pediatric use that do not have a flow restrictor or another mechanism to reduce accidental ingestion.</summary>
