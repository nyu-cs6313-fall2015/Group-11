                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to require an 
 applicant for voter registration for elections for Federal office to 
     affirmatively state that the applicant meets the eligibility 
requirements for voting in such elections as a condition of completing 
  the application, to require States to verify that an applicant for 
      registering to vote in such elections meets the eligibility 
  requirements for voting in such elections prior to registering the 
               applicant to vote, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Restoring Important Voter 
Eligibility Requirements to States Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Congress enacted the National Voter Registration Act of 
        1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.) to promote the rights of 
        citizens of the United States to exercise the fundamental right 
        to vote, as set forth in the findings of such Act (42 U.S.C. 
        1973gg(a)).
            (2) While the purposes of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1973gg(b)) 
        include increasing voter registration and voter participation 
        in elections for Federal office, the language does not refer to 
        individuals in general but refers exclusively to ``eligible 
        citizens of the United States''.
            (3) An additional purpose of such Act is to ``protect the 
        integrity of the electoral process'' (42 U.S.C. 1973gg(b)(3)).
            (4) Individuals who do not meet the eligibility 
        requirements for voting in elections for Federal office, 
        including individuals who are not citizens of the United 
        States, have been permitted to register to vote in such 
        elections and are presumably casting ballots in such elections.
            (5) The participation of ineligible voters in elections for 
        Federal office is in direct conflict with the intent of 
        Congress in enacting the National Voter Registration Act of 
        1993 and with the purpose of such Act.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that the 
procedures for registering individuals to vote in elections for Federal 
office are consistent with the purposes of the National Voter 
Registration Act of 1993.
