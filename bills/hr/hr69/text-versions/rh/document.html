regulations, in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States 
Code, and consistent with the provisions of this title, as may be 
necessary to carry out the purposes of this title to the extent that 
such regulations are not already promulgated.
    (b) Consultation; Utilization of Existing Reporting Mechanisms.--In 
promulgating regulations, procedures, and guidance pursuant to 
subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of State 
and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is

procedures shall utilize existing reporting mechanisms maintained and 
operated by the department in which the Coast Guard is operating.
    (c) Ports of Entry.--The Secretary, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Homeland Security and, when the Coast Guard is not 
operating in the Department of Homeland Security, the Secretary of the 
department in which the Coast Guard is operating, may designate and 
publicize the ports to which vessels may seek entry. No port may be 
designated under this section that has not also been designated as a 
port of entry for customs reporting purposes pursuant to section 1433 
of title 19, United States Code, or that is not specified under an 
existing international fisheries agreement.
    (d) Notification.--The Secretary shall provide notification of the 
denial of port entry or the use of port services for a vessel under 
section 305, the withdrawal of the denial of port services for a 
vessel, the taking of enforcement action pursuant to section 306 with 
respect to a vessel, or the results of any inspection of a vessel 
conducted pursuant to this title to the flag nation of the vessel and, 
as appropriate, to the nation of which the vessel's master is a 
national, relevant coastal nations, RFMOs, the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations, and other relevant international 
organizations.
    (e) Confirmation That Fish Were Taken in Accordance With 
Conservation and Management Measures.--The Secretary may request 
confirmation from the flag state of a vessel that the fish on board a 
vessel in a port subject to the jurisdiction of the United States were 
taken in accordance with applicable RFMO conservation and management 
measures.

    (a) Submission of Information Required Under Agreement.--All 
foreign vessels seeking entry to a port subject to the jurisdiction of 
the United States must submit to the Secretary of the department in 
which the Coast Guard is operating information as required under the 
Agreement in advance of its arrival in port.
    (b) Decision To Authorize or Deny Port Entry.--The Secretary shall 
decide, based on the information submitted under subsection (a), 
whether to authorize or deny port entry and shall communicate this

            (2) any foreign vessel the Secretary has reasonable grounds 
        to believe has engaged in IUU fishing or fishing-related 
        activities in support of such fishing or has violated the Act.
    (c) Denial of Use of Port.--If a foreign vessel is in a port 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, the Secretary shall 
deny such vessel the use of the port for landing, transshipment, 
packaging and processing of fish, refueling, resupplying, maintenance 
and drydocking, if--
            (1) the vessel entered without authorization under 
        subsection (b);
            (2) the vessel is a listed IUU vessel;
            (3) the flag nation of the vessel has failed to provide 
        confirmation requested by the Secretary that the fish on board 
        were taken in accordance with applicable RFMO conservation and 
        management measures; or
            (4) the Secretary has reasonable grounds to believe--
                    (A) the vessel lacks valid authorizations to engage 
                in fishing or fishing-related activities as required by 
                its flag nation or the relevant coastal nation;
                    (B) the fish on board were taken in violation of 
                foreign law or in contravention of any RFMO 
                conservation and management measure; or
                    (C) the vessel has engaged in IUU fishing or 
                fishing-related activities in support of such fishing, 
                including in support of a listed IUU vessel, unless it 
                can establish that--
                            (i) it was acting in a manner consistent 
                        with applicable RFMO conservation and 
                        management measures; or
                            (ii) in the case of the provision of 
                        personnel, fuel, gear, and other supplies at 
                        sea, the vessel provisioned was not, at the 
                        time of provisioning, a listed IUU vessel.
    (d) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c), the 
Secretary may allow port entry or the use of port services--
            (1) if they are essential to the safety or health of the 
        crew or safety of the vessel;
            (2) to allow, where appropriate, for the scrapping of the 
        vessel; or
            (3) pursuant to an inspection or other enforcement action.

SEC. 306. INSPECTIONS.

    The Secretary, and the Secretary of the department in which the 
Coast Guard is operating, shall conduct foreign vessel inspections in

achieve the purposes of the Agreement and this title. If, following an 
inspection, the Secretary has reasonable grounds to believe that a 
foreign vessel has engaged in IUU fishing or fishing-related activities 
in support of such fishing, the Secretary may take enforcement action 
under this title or other applicable law, and shall deny the vessel the 
use of port services, in accordance with section 305.

        seizures and forfeitures incurred, or alleged to have been 
        incurred, under the provisions of this title, insofar as 
        applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions hereof. For 
        seizures and forfeitures of property under this section by the 
        Secretary, such duties as are imposed upon the customs officer 
        or any other person with respect to the seizure and forfeiture 
        of property under the customs law may be performed by such 
        officers as are designated by the Secretary or, upon request of 
        the Secretary, by any other agency that has authority to manage 
        and dispose of seized property.
            (3) Presumption.--For the purposes of this section there is 
        a rebuttable presumption that all fish, or components thereof, 
        found on board a vessel that is used or seized in connection 
        with a violation of this title (including any regulation 
        promulgated under this Act) were taken, obtained, or retained 
        as a result of IUU fishing or fishing-related activities in 
        support of IUU fishing.
    (d) Criminal Enforcement.--Any person (other than a foreign 
government agency, or entity wholly owned by a foreign government) who 
knowingly commits an act prohibited by section 309 shall be subject to 
subsections (b) and (c) of section 309 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 
U.S.C. 1859).
    (e) Payment of Storage, Care, and Other Costs.--Any person assessed 
a civil penalty for, or convicted of, any violation of this title 
(including any regulation promulgated under this title) and any 
claimant in a forfeiture action brought for such a violation, shall be 
liable for the reasonable costs incurred by the Secretary in storage, 
care, and maintenance of any property seized in connection with the 
violation.

SEC. 309. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND ASSISTANCE.

    (a) Assistance to Developing Nations and International 
Organizations.--Consistent with existing authority and the availability 
of funds, the Secretary shall provide appropriate assistance to 
developing nations and international organizations of which such 
nations are members to assist those nations in meeting their 
obligations under the Agreement.
    (b) Personnel, Services, Equipment, and Facilities.--In carrying 
out subsection (a), the Secretary may, by agreement, on a reimbursable 
or nonreimbursable basis, utilize the personnel, services, equipment, 
and facilities of any Federal, State, local, or foreign government or 
any entity of any such government.

SEC. 310. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS.

    (a) In General.--Nothing in this title shall be construed to 
displace any requirements imposed by the customs laws of the United 
States or any other laws or regulations enforced or administered by the 
Secretary of Homeland Security. Where more stringent requirements 
regarding port entry or access to port services exist under other 
Federal law, those more stringent requirements shall apply. Nothing in 
this title shall affect a vessel's entry into port, in accordance with 
international law, for reasons of force majeure or distress.
    (b) United States Obligations Under International Law.--This title 
shall be interpreted and applied in accordance with United States 
obligations under international law.
