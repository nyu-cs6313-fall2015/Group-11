    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. LAND PORTS OF ENTRY AND INTERNATIONAL BRIDGES.

    Section 3307 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following:
    ``(i) Land Ports of Entry and International Bridges.--
            ``(1) Leases.--The Administrator is authorized to enter 
        into contracts for the lease of a covered facility and its site 
        for periods of not to exceed 30 years.
            ``(2) Calculation of transactions.--For purposes of the 
        Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the 
        Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Budget Enforcement Act of 
        1990, and scorekeeping guidelines, the Office of Management and 
        Budget and the Congressional Budget Office shall score any 
        contract entered into by the Administrator under this chapter 
        for the lease of a covered facility and its site in the same 
        manner as if the contract was entered into on September 30, 
        1990.
            ``(3) Analysis of transactions.--
                    ``(A) Analysis required before leases or direct 
                purchases or construction.--Before entering into a 
                contract for the lease of a covered facility or 
                directly purchasing or constructing a covered facility, 
                the Administrator shall transmit to Congress a report 
                containing an analysis of the cost effectiveness of 
                leasing the covered facility as compared to directly 
                purchasing or constructing the covered facility.
                    ``(B) Limitation on direct purchases and 
                construction.--The Administrator may not directly 
                purchase or construct a covered facility if the 
                Administrator determines under subparagraph (A) that 
                leasing the covered facility is more cost effective.
            ``(4) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following 
        definitions apply:
                    ``(A) Covered facility.--The term `covered 
                facility' means a land port of entry or international 
                bridge.
                    ``(B) Lease.--The term `lease' includes a lease 
                purchase.''.
                                 <all>
