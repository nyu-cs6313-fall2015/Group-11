Allows such entity to enter into a partnership with a state, local government, community health center, local health department, hospital, or other appropriate organization.\n\nRequires a grant or contract agreement: (1) in the case of a new or existing medical residency training program in the field of primary care, to require the recipient to provide one-third of the cost of the slots to be funded and to require the Administrator to provide the remaining two-thirds of such cost; and (2) in the case of such a training program in any other field, to require the recipient to provide one-half of the cost of the slots to be funded and the Administrator to provide the remaining half.\n\nDirects the Administrator to establish application processes for eligible entities to receive funding, including multiyear commitments to ensure the continued funding of GME slots for residents in training."
