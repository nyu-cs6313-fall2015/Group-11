                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat Indian tribal 
governments in the same manner as State governments for certain Federal 
                 tax purposes, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Tax and Investment Reform Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) There is a unique Federal legal and political 
        relationship between the United States and Indian tribes.
            (2) Indian tribes have the responsibility and authority to 
        provide governmental programs and services to tribal citizens, 
        develop tribal economies, and build community infrastructure to 
        ensure that Indian reservation lands serve as livable, 
        permanent homes.
            (3) The United States Constitution, U.S. Federal Court 
        decisions, Executive orders, and numerous other Federal laws 
        and regulations recognize that Indian tribes are governments, 
        retaining the inherent authority to tax and operate as other 
        governments, including (inter alia) financing projects with 
        government bonds and maintaining eligibility for general tax 
        exemptions via their government status.
            (4) Codifying tax parity with respect to tribal governments 
        is consistent with Federal treaties recognizing the sovereignty 
        of tribal governments.
            (5) That Indian tribes face historic disadvantages in 
        accessing the underlying capital to build the necessary 
        infrastructure for job creation, and that certain statutory 
        restrictions on tribal governance further inhibit tribes' 
        ability to develop strong governance and economies.
            (6) Indian tribes are sometimes excluded from the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986 in key provisions which results in unfair 
        tax treatment for tribal citizens or unequal enforcement 
        authority for tribal enforcement agencies.
            (7) Congress is vested with the authority to regulate 
        commerce with Indian tribes, and hereby exercises that 
        authority in a manner which furthers tribal self-governance, 
        and in doing so, further affirms the United States government-
        to-government relationship with Indian tribes.

SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF INDIAN TRIBES AS STATES WITH RESPECT TO BOND 
              ISSUANCE.

    (a) In General.--Subsection (c) of section 7871 of the Internal

                section 146(d)(1)(A) (using national tribal population 
                estimates supplied annually by the Department of the 
                Interior in consultation with the Census Bureau), and
                    ``(B) the minimum State ceiling amount in section 
                146(d)(1)(B) (as adjusted in accordance with the cost 
                of living provision in section 146(d)(2)), and
            ``(2) allocate such national bond volume cap among all
