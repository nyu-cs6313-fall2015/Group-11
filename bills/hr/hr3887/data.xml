Requires release to those Members of such payments after April 16 of the calendar year, only upon the earlier of: (1) the day on which that house agrees to a concurrent budget resolution for the fiscal year which begins on October 1 of that calendar year, or (2) the last day of Congress during which that calendar year occurs.

Requires release to the appropriate Members of salary payments after August 1 of the calendar year, only upon the earlier of: (1) the day on which that house has passed each of the regular appropriation bills for the fiscal year which begins on October 1 of that calendar year, or (2) the last day of Congress during which that calendar year occurs.

Requires the payroll administrator of a house of Congress, in order to ensure that this Act is carried out in a manner consistent with the Constitution, to release for payments to Members of that house any amounts remaining in any escrow account under this Act on the last day of Congress during which the amounts were deposited in such account.</summary>
