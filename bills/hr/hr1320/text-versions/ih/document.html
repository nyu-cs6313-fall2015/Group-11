To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve coverage for 
   colorectal screening tests under Medicare, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting 
Colorectal Examination and Education Now Act of 2013'' or the ``SCREEN 
Act of 2013''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings.
Sec. 3. Temporary increase in payment rate for certain cancer screening 
                            tests.
Sec. 4. Waiving Medicare cost-sharing for colorectal cancer screening 
                            with therapeutic effect.
Sec. 5. Medicare coverage for an office visit or consultation prior to 
                            a qualifying screening colonoscopy.
Sec. 6. Budget neutrality.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Colon cancer is the third most common cause of cancer-
        related deaths and the second most common cancer for both men 
        and women.
            (2) According to the American Cancer Society, over 50,000 
        people will die this year from colon cancer.
            (3) Colorectal cancer is highly treatable with appropriate 
        screening. According to the American Cancer Society (2010 Facts 
        & Figures), the 5-year survival rate is 90 percent for those 
        individuals who are diagnosed at an early stage of the cancer. 
        However, less than 40 percent of colon cancer cases are 
        diagnosed at an early stage.
            (4) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently 
        estimated that approximately 2,000 deaths could be avoided if 
        colonoscopy screening rates rose by just 10 percent.
            (5) Colonoscopies allow for simultaneous colorectal cancer 
        screenings and detection and the removal of precancerous 
        polyps, thus preventing cancer from developing.
            (6) The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force provides an 
        ``A'' rating for colorectal cancer screenings.
            (7) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
        colorectal cancer control program has set a target of screening 
        80 percent of eligible adults in certain States by 2014. The 
        American Cancer Society and other patient advocacy groups have 
        a target rate of 75 percent.
            (8) Only between 52 and 58 percent of Medicare 
        beneficiaries have had any colorectal cancer screening test, 
        despite Medicare coverage for such tests.
            (9) Only 49.3 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who are 50 
        to 80 years old receive colorectal cancer screenings within 
        recommended intervals.
            (10) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services notes 
        that there is ``clearly an opportunity to improve colorectal 
        cancer screening rates in the Medicare population''.
            (11) A January 2011 study by the Colon Cancer Alliance 
        concludes that most Americans over the age of 50--
                    (A) wish a health care provider was able to sit 
                down with them to discuss a colonoscopy before 
                undergoing the test; and
                    (B) forgo a colonoscopy due to fear of the 
                procedure.
            (12) In February 2010, the National Institutes of Health 
        hosted a conference on colorectal cancer screening and cited 
        patient awareness and fears as barriers to increasing 
        colorectal cancer screening rates.
            (13) According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, 
        colonoscopy is one of the most common procedures performed in 
        the ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) and ``the decline in 
        payment rate for the highest volume procedures is especially a 
        strong concern for ASCs that focus on gastroenterology''.
            (14) An Institute of Medicine study on colorectal cancer 
        screening cited the inadequate reimbursement for preventive 
        care services as one of the constraints limiting colorectal 
        cancer screening rates.
            (15) Colorectal cancer screening by colonoscopy has been 
        demonstrated to reduce Medicare costs over the long-term.

SEC. 3. TEMPORARY INCREASE IN PAYMENT RATE FOR CERTAIN CANCER SCREENING 
              TESTS.

    (a) In General.--With respect to a qualifying cancer screening test 
furnished during the 5-year period beginning on January 1, 2014, by a 
qualifying provider, the amount otherwise payable under section 1833 or 
section 1848 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l, 1395w-4) to 
such provider for such test shall be increased by 10 percent.
    (b) Qualifying Cancer Screening Test.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, subject to 
        paragraph (2), the term ``qualifying cancer screening test'' 
        means, with respect to a Medicare beneficiary, a cancer 
        screening test that has in effect with respect to such 
        beneficiary a rating of `A' in the current recommendations of 
        the United States Preventive Services Task Force.
            (2) Termination when high utilization rate reached.--If the 
        Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that a cancer 
        screening test described in paragraph (1) has a utilization 
        rate of at least 75 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries for 
        whom such screening has such a recommendation, effective as of 
        the first day of the year after the year in which such 
        determination is made, the cancer screening test shall not be a 
        qualifying cancer screening test.
    (c) Qualifying Provider Defined.--For purposes of this section, the 
term ``qualifying provider'' means, with respect to a qualifying cancer 
screening test, an individual or entity--
            (1) that is eligible for payment for such test under 
        section 1833 or section 1848 of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 1395l, 1395w-4); and
            (2) that--
                    (A) participates in a nationally recognized quality 
                improvement registry with respect to such test; and
                    (B) demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the 
                Secretary, based on the information in such registry, 
                that the tests were provided by such individual or 
                entity in accordance with accepted outcomes-based 
                quality measures.

SEC. 4. WAIVING MEDICARE COST-SHARING FOR COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING 
              WITH THERAPEUTIC EFFECT.

    (a) In General.--Section 1833(a)(1)(Y) of the Social Security Act

        on the individual, an outpatient office visit or consultation 
        for the purpose of beneficiary education, assuring selection of

subsection (d) of section 1848 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395w-4) for each year (beginning with 2014) to the extent necessary to
