SEC. 2. ENHANCING THE AUTHORITY OF THE NATIONAL CREDIT UNION 
              ADMINISTRATION.

    (a) Review of Bureau Regulations.--
            (1) In general.--Section 120 of the Federal Credit Union 
        Act (12 U.S.C. 1766) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following:
    ``(k) Review of Bureau Regulations.--If the Board determines that a 
regulation issued by the Bureau would create an undue hardship when 
applied to credit unions, the Board may--
            ``(1) delay the application of the regulation to credit 
        unions until such time as the Board determines such application 
        would not create an undue hardship; and
            ``(2) modify such regulation, as applied to credit unions, 
        so long as the Board determines that such modification still 
        meets the Bureau's objective in issuing the regulation.''.
            (2) Bureau defined.--Section 101 of the Federal Credit 
        Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1752) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following new paragraph:
            ``(10) The term `Bureau' means the Bureau of Consumer 
        Financial Protection.''.
    (b) Use of State Regulations by Federal Credit Unions.--Section 120 
of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1766), as amended by 
subsection (a), is further amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(l) Use of State Regulations.--
            ``(1) Application.--With respect to a State law applicable 
        to a State credit union, a Federal credit union may apply to 
        the Board for permission to comply with such regulation in lieu 
        of the applicable Federal regulation (if any), for purposes of 
        the credit union's branches located in such State. Such 
        permission shall only apply to the State for which the 
        permission is given, and the Federal credit union may not 
        comply with such regulation in any other State in lieu of the 
        applicable Federal regulation.
            ``(2) Determination.--The Board may approve an application 
        received under paragraph (1) if the Board determines that 
        having the Federal credit union's branches in such State comply 
        with the particular State law would--
                    ``(A) improve the credit unions's ability to serve 
                members and lend in that particular State; and
                    ``(B) not endanger the safety and soundness of the 
                credit union.
            ``(3) Exception.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a Federal 
        credit union may not apply to the Board for permission to 
        comply with any provision of a State law if such law would 
        conflict with the requirements of section 107A.''.

              UNIONS.

    (a) In General.--Section 216 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12

            (2) by inserting after subsection (n) the following:
    ``(o) Revised Capital Standards.--
            ``(1) Two-tier system.--The Board shall implement a two-
        tier system of net worth ratios for credit unions, consisting 
        of a risk-based net worth ratio and a net worth capital ratio. 
        Net worth categories in this section shall take into account 
        the simplicity or complexity of credit unions in terms of risk 
        profile.
            ``(2) Use of leverage ratios.--The Board shall establish 
        standards under this section with respect to leverage ratios of 
        a credit union to the same extent as are provided for net worth 
        ratios of a credit union. Such standards shall take into 
        account the unique nature of credit unions and, to the extent 
        practicable, be comparable to, but not necessarily identical 
        to, the leverage ratio standards under section 38 of the 
        Federal Deposit Insurance Act.''; and
            (3) in subsection (p), as so redesignated, by amending 
        paragraph (2) to read as follows:

                union, as determined under generally accepted 
                accounting principles, together with--

                        retained earnings of any other credit union 
                        with which the credit union has combined; and

                        accepted accounting principles not included in 
                        retained earnings, as determined by the Board;
                    ``(B) with respect to any insured credit union, 
                includes, at the Board's discretion and subject to 
                rules and regulations established by the Board, 
                assistance provided under section 208 of this title to 
                facilitate a least-cost resolution consistent with the 
                best interests of the credit union system; and
                    ``(C) with respect to a low income credit union, 
                includes secondary capital accounts, subject to 
                limitations set by the Board to address the safe and 
                sound use of secondary capital to carry out the purpose 
                of this section, that are--
                            ``(i) uninsured; and
                            ``(ii) subordinate to all other claims 
                        against the credit union, including the claims 
                        of creditors, shareholders, and the Fund.''.
