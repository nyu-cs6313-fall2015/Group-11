Prescribes analogous requirements for lease transfers.\n\nRequires rentals or royalties received by the United States to be deposited in the Treasury for federal budget deficit reduction or, if there is no federal budget deficit, for reducing the federal debt.\n\nDirects the Secretary to agree to a lessee's request to amend any lease issued for any Central and Western Gulf of Mexico tract in the period of January 1, 1996, through November 28, 2000, to incorporate price thresholds applicable to royalty suspension requirements that are equal to or less than the price thresholds specified under OCSLA.\n\nNo Free Inspections for Oil Companies Act - Amends the OCSLA to direct the Secretary to establish and collect nonrefundable facility inspection fees from operators of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) facilities.\n\nEstablishes in the Treasury the Ocean Energy Enforcement Fund as depository for such fees.\n\nRequires amounts collected by the Secretary to be credited as offsetting collections and to be made available for expenditure only for implementing inspections of OCS facilities (including mobile offshore drilling units) and for administration of the inspection program.\n\nEnd Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act of 2013 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures, to apply the special rule for major integrated oil companies to any covered large oil company with gross receipts exceeding $50 million for the taxable year.\n\nExcepts any taxpayer with gross receipts exceeding $50 million for the taxable year from: (1) the requirement to include all items of gross income in gross income for the year, (2) the enhanced oil recovery credit, (3) the deduction for intangible drilling and development costs in the case of oil and gas wells, (4) the percentage oil depletion allowance, (5) the deduction for tertiary injectants, (6) passive activity losses and credits, and (7) the deduction for income attributable to domestic production activities.\n\nDenies the use of last-in, first-out (LIFO) accounting for major integrated oil companies.\n\nPrescribes a special rule for the treatment of foreign taxes paid by a dual capacity taxpayer that is a major integrated oil company."
