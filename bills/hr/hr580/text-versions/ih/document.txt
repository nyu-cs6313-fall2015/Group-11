        free trade agreement requiring national treatment for trade in 
        natural gas'' and inserting ``foreign country described in 
        paragraph (2)''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(2) A foreign country described in this paragraph is--
            ``(A) a nation with which there is in effect a free trade 
        agreement requiring national treatment for trade in natural 
        gas;
            ``(B) a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization;
            ``(C) subject to paragraph (3), Japan; and

        exportation of natural gas to that foreign country would 
        promote the national security interests of the United States.
    ``(3) The exportation of natural gas to Japan shall be deemed to be 
consistent with the public interest pursuant to paragraph (1), and 
applications for such exportation shall be granted without modification 
or delay under that paragraph, during only such period as the Treaty of

and entered into force June 23, 1960 (11 UST 1632; TIAS 4509), between 
the United States and Japan, remains in effect.''.
