                                 A BILL


 
    To authorize the direct provision of defense articles, defense 
 services, and related training to the Kurdistan Regional Government, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since 2011, the terrorist group now known as the 
        Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), has rapidly 
        expanded, now possessing greater funding, more personnel, and 
        heavier weapons than any other terrorist force.
            (2) ISIL has threatened to continue attacking United States 
        persons and interests and has an apocalyptic vision for a 
        larger confrontation with the United States and its allies in 
        the Middle East.
            (3) According to the United States intelligence community, 
        approximately 20,000 to 30,000 ISIL fighters operate in Iraq 
        and Syria, an estimated 3,000 of which are believed to have 
        western passports.
            (4) ISIL finances itself through looting, smuggling, taxes, 
        oil sales, kidnapping, and human trafficking.
            (5) According to United States officials, ISIL captured 
        approximately 1,500 Humvees, a number of other modern armored 
        vehicles and transport trucks, over 50 long-range Global 
        Positioning System (GPS)-guided artillery pieces, a substantial 
        number of artillery shells, a large quantity of small arms, 
        approximately 4,000 heavy machine guns, and other weapons from 
        the Iraqi Security Forces in June 2014, and has also reportedly 
        captured a number of other weapons and vehicles from Bashar al-
        Assad's forces in Syria.
            (6) The rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in 
        Iraq caused by ISIL advances in Iraq and Syria has resulted in 
        approximately 1,500,000 refugees and internally displaced 
        people from Syria and Iraq taking refuge in the Iraqi Kurdistan 
        region. The Kurdistan Regional Government is facing a 
        humanitarian and budget crisis while defending itself from 
        ISIL.
            (7) The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is the 
        democratically elected government of the Kurdistan Region in 
        Iraq, and Iraqi Kurds have been a reliable and stable partner 
        of the United States.
            (8) The Iraqi constitution guarantees the right of Iraqi 
        regions, such as Iraqi Kurdistan, to maintain ``internal 
        security forces for the region such as police, security forces, 
        and guards of the region''.
            (9) The Kurdish Peshmerga forces are officially organized 
        under the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs and commanded by the 
        Minister of Peshmerga, who reports to the President of the 
        Kurdistan Regional Government.
            (10) ISIL has positioned its forces along a 650-mile border 
        with the Kurdistan Regional Government's Peshmerga forces.
            (11) ISIL has employed captured armored vehicles, long-
        range artillery, and heavy weapons in attacking thinly 
        stretched Kurdish forces along the border.
            (12) United States airstrikes against ISIL targets have 
        helped stall the terrorist organization's advance on territory 
        held by Kurdish forces, but have not proven to be militarily 
        decisive against ISIL.
            (13) The United States and its allies have provided the 
        resupply of various small arms and training to Peshmerga forces 
        since June 2014.
            (14) Such resupply efforts, to comply with United States 
        law, must be approved and coordinated through the Government of 
        Iraq. In the initial phase of the resupply effort, the 
        Government of Iraq constrained and delayed the emergency supply 
        of weapons to the Kurdistan Regional Government.
            (15) The Peshmerga forces lack battle-ready armored 
        vehicles and the ability to take significant offensive action 
        against ISIL forces, leading to requests for such assistance.
            (16) Armored vehicles, anti-armor weapons, long-range 
        artillery, and other weapons are consistent with the Kurdistan 
        Regional Government's constitutional right to defend itself 
        against the clear and present danger posed by ISIL.
            (17) A strong Peshmerga force is essential to countering 
        the ISIL threat to Iraq, the region, and United States 
        interests.
            (18) The longer ISIL's sanctuary remains largely 
        unchallenged, the more time it will have to reinforce its 
        positions, and plan attacks against United States interests.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) defeating the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant 
        (ISIL) is critical to maintaining a unified Iraq in which all 
        faiths and ethnicities are afforded equal protection and full 
        integration into the Iraqi government and society;
            (2) the people of Kurdistan face an urgent and deadly 
        threat from ISIL which the Iraqi Security Forces, of which the 
        Peshmerga are a component, are currently unable to match in 
        armaments;
            (3) any outstanding issues between the Government of Iraq 
        and the Kurdistan Regional Government should be resolved by the 
        two parties expeditiously to allow for a resumption of normal 
        relations; and
            (4) ISIL's recent advances and continued growth present an 
        imminent threat to Iraqi Kurdistan, the rest of Iraq and the 
        Middle East, and international security.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States to directly provide the 
Kurdistan Regional Government with advanced conventional weapons, 
training, and defense services, on an emergency and temporary basis, to 
more effectively partner with the United States and other international 
coalition members to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant 
(ISIL).

SEC. 4. TEMPORARY EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF DEFENSE ARTICLES, DEFENSE 
              SERVICES, AND RELATED TRAINING DIRECTLY TO THE KURDISTAN 
              REGIONAL GOVERNMENT.

        successor group.
            (2) Defense exports.--The President is authorized to issue
