temporary fiduciaries for a period not to exceed 120 days. If a final

        available to assist the beneficiary; or

        subsection (a)(1), the following new section:
``Sec. 5502A. Supervision of fiduciaries
    ``(a) Commission.--(1)(A) In a case in which the Secretary 
determines that a commission is necessary in order to obtain the 
services of a fiduciary in the best interests of a beneficiary, the 
Secretary may authorize a fiduciary appointed by the Secretary to 
obtain from the monthly benefits provided to the beneficiary a 
reasonable commission for fiduciary services rendered, but the 
commission for any month may not exceed the lesser of the following 
amounts:
            ``(i) The amount that equals three percent of the monthly 
        monetary benefits under laws administered by the Secretary paid 
        on behalf of the beneficiary to the fiduciary.
            ``(ii) $35.
    ``(B) A commission paid under this paragraph may not be derived 
from any award to a beneficiary regarding back pay or retroactive 
benefits payments.
    ``(C) A commission may not be authorized for a fiduciary who 
receives any other form of remuneration or payment in connection with 
rendering fiduciary services for benefits under this title on behalf of 
the beneficiary.
    ``(D) In accordance with section 6106 of this title, a commission 
may not be paid to a fiduciary if the Secretary determines that the 
fiduciary misused any benefit payments of a beneficiary.
    ``(E) If the Secretary determines that the fiduciary has misused 
any benefit or payments of a beneficiary, the Secretary may revoke the 
fiduciary status of the fiduciary.
    ``(2) Where, in the opinion of the Secretary, any fiduciary 
receiving funds on behalf of a Department beneficiary is acting in such 
a number of cases as to make it impracticable to conserve properly the 
estates or to supervise the persons of the beneficiaries, the Secretary 
may refuse to make future payments in such cases as the Secretary may 
deem proper.
    ``(b) Court.--Whenever it appears that any fiduciary, in the 
opinion of the Secretary, is not properly executing or has not properly 
executed the duties of the trust of such fiduciary or has collected or 
paid, or is attempting to collect or pay, fees, commissions, or 
allowances that are inequitable or in excess of those allowed by law 
for the duties performed or expenses incurred, or has failed to make 
such payments as may be necessary for the benefit of the ward or the 
dependents of the ward, then the Secretary may appear, by the 
Secretary's authorized attorney, in the court which has appointed such 
fiduciary, or in any court having original, concurrent, or appellate 
jurisdiction over said cause, and make proper presentation of such 
matters. The Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may suspend 
payments to any such fiduciary who shall neglect or refuse, after 
reasonable notice, to render an account to the Secretary from time to 
time showing the application of such payments for the benefit of such 
incompetent or minor beneficiary, or who shall neglect or refuse to 
administer the estate according to law. The Secretary may require the 
fiduciary, as part of such account, to disclose any additional 
financial information concerning the beneficiary (except for 
information that is not available to the fiduciary). The Secretary may 
appear or intervene by the Secretary's duly authorized attorney in any 
court as an interested party in any litigation instituted by the 
Secretary or otherwise, directly affecting money paid to such fiduciary 
under this section.
    ``(c) Payment of Certain Expenses.--Authority is hereby granted for 
the payment of any court or other expenses incident to any 
investigation or court proceeding for the appointment of any fiduciary 
or other person for the purpose of payment of benefits payable under 
laws administered by the Secretary or the removal of such fiduciary and 
appointment of another, and of expenses in connection with the 
administration of such benefits by such fiduciaries, or in connection 
with any other court proceeding hereby authorized, when such payment is 
authorized by the Secretary.
    ``(d) Temporary Payment of Benefits.--All or any part of any 
benefits the payment of which is suspended or withheld under this 
section may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be paid temporarily to 
the person having custody and control of the incompetent or minor 
beneficiary, to be used solely for the benefit of such beneficiary, or, 
in the case of an incompetent veteran, may be apportioned to the 
dependent or dependents, if any, of such veteran. Any part not so paid 
and any funds of a mentally incompetent or insane veteran not paid to 
the chief officer of the institution in which such veteran is a patient 
nor apportioned to the veteran's dependent or dependents may be ordered 
held in the Treasury to the credit of such beneficiary. All funds so 
held shall be disbursed under the order and in the discretion of the 
Secretary for the benefit of such beneficiary or the beneficiary's 
dependents. Any balance remaining in such fund to the credit of any 
beneficiary may be paid to the beneficiary if the beneficiary recovers 
and is found competent, or if a minor, attains majority, or otherwise 
to the beneficiary's fiduciary, or, in the event of the beneficiary's 
death, to the beneficiary's personal representative, except as 
otherwise provided by law; however, payment will not be made to the 
beneficiary's personal representative if, under the law of the 
beneficiary's last legal residence, the beneficiary's estate would 
escheat to the State. In the event of the death of a mentally 
incompetent or insane veteran, all gratuitous benefits under laws 
administered by the Secretary deposited before or after August 7, 1959, 
in the personal funds of patients trust fund on account of such veteran 
shall not be paid to the personal representative of such veteran, but 
shall be paid to the following persons living at the time of 
settlement, and in the order named: The surviving spouse, the children 
(without regard to age or marital status) in equal parts, and the 
dependent parents of such veteran, in equal parts. If any balance 
remains, such balance shall be deposited to the credit of the 
applicable current appropriation; except that there may be paid only so 
much of such balance as may be necessary to reimburse a person (other 
than a political subdivision of the United States) who bore the 
expenses of last sickness or burial of the veteran for such expenses. 
No payment shall be made under the two preceding sentences of this 
subsection unless claim therefor is filed with the Secretary within 
five years after the death of the veteran, except that, if any person 
so entitled under said two sentences is under legal disability at the 
time of death of the veteran, such five-year period of limitation shall 
run from the termination or removal of the legal disability.
    ``(e) Escheatment.--Any funds in the hands of a fiduciary appointed 
by a State court or the Secretary derived from benefits payable under 
laws administered by the Secretary, which under the law of the State 
wherein the beneficiary had last legal residence would escheat to the 
State, shall escheat to the United States and shall be returned by such 
fiduciary, or by the personal representative of the deceased 
beneficiary, less legal expenses of any administration necessary to 
determine that an escheat is in order, to the Department, and shall be 
deposited to the credit of the applicable revolving fund, trust fund, 
or appropriation.
    ``(f) Assistance.--The Secretary shall provide to a fiduciary 
appointed under section 5502 of this title materials and tools to 
assist the fiduciary in carrying out the responsibilities of the 
fiduciary under this chapter, including--
            ``(1) handbooks, brochures, or other written material that 
        explain the responsibilities of a fiduciary under this chapter;
            ``(2) tools located on an Internet website, including forms 
        to submit to the Secretary required information; and

        beginning of chapter 55 of title 38, United States Code, is 
        amended by inserting after the item relating to section 5502 
        the following new item:

    (c) Definition of Fiduciary.--Section 5506 of title 38, United 
States Code is amended--

        purposes''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a), the term `person' includes 
any--

        carry out income maintenance, social service, or health care-
        related activities;

                concurrently to five or more individuals; and
                    ``(ii) is not a creditor of any such individual.
    ``(2) The Secretary shall maintain a list of State or local 
agencies and nonprofit social service agencies under paragraph (1) that
