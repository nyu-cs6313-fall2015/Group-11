                                 A BILL


 
         To end unemployment payments to jobless millionaires.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ending Unemployment Payments to 
Jobless Millionaires Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. ENDING UNEMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS TO JOBLESS MILLIONAIRES.

    (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no 
Federal funds may be used to make payments of unemployment compensation 
(including such compensation under the Federal-State Extended 
Compensation Act of 1970 and the emergency unemployment compensation 
program under title IV of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008) in 
a year to an individual whose resources in the preceding year were 
equal to or greater than $1,000,000. For purposes of the preceding 
sentence, with respect to a year, an individual's resources shall be 
determined in the same manner as a subsidy eligible individual's 
resources are determined for the year under section 1860D-14(a)(3)(E) 
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-114(a)(3)(E)).
    (b) Effective Date.--The prohibition under subsection (a) shall 
apply to weeks of unemployment beginning on or after the date of the 
enactment of this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
