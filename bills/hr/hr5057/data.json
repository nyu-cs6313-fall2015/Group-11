Applies this exemption to EPS service parts or spare parts manufactured during the period from February 10, 2016, through February 10, 2020, for end-use products that were manufactured before February 10, 2016.\n\nRequires such EPS parts to meet: (1) efficiency standards under the Act that were in effect prior to the issuance of the standards established in 2014, and (2) labeling and certification requirements under the External Power Supply International Efficiency Marking Protocol. Establishes reporting requirements for exempted EPS products."
