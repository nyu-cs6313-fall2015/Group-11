Provides a similar extension process with respect to the exchange established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nProvides similar terms for initial or special enrollment periods applicable to other health insurance coverage in the individual market.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt individuals, for taxable year 2014, from the penalty for not maintaining minimum essential coverage for any month ending on or before the initial enrollment period closing date for the state of the individual's residence."
