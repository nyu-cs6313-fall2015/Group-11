                                 An Act


 
To designate a Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial at the March 
               Field Air Museum in Riverside, California.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Distinguished Flying Cross National 
Memorial Act''.
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS NATIONAL MEMORIAL IN 
RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) The most reliable statistics regarding the number of 
    members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Distinguished 
    Flying Cross indicate that 126,318 members of the Armed Forces 
    received the medal during World War II, approximately 21,000 
    members received the medal during the Korean conflict, and 21,647 
    members received the medal during the Vietnam War. Since the end of 
    the Vietnam War, more than 203 Armed Forces members have received 
    the medal in times of conflict.
        (2) The National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, 
    Missouri, burned down in 1973, and thus many more recipients of the 
    Distinguished Flying Cross may be undocumented. Currently, the 
    Department of Defense continues to locate and identify members of 
    the Armed Forces who have received the medal and are undocumented.
        (3) The United States currently lacks a national memorial 
    dedicated to the bravery and sacrifice of those members of the 
    Armed Forces who have distinguished themselves by heroic deeds 
    performed in aerial flight.
        (4) An appropriate memorial to current and former members of 
    the Armed Forces is under construction at March Field Air Museum in 
    Riverside, California.
        (5) This memorial will honor all those members of the Armed 
    Forces who have distinguished themselves in aerial flight, whether 
    documentation of such members who earned the Distinguished Flying 
    Cross exists or not.
    (b) Designation.--The memorial to members of the Armed Forces who 
have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, located at March 
Field Air Museum in Riverside, California, is hereby designated as the 
Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial.
    (c) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial designated by 
this section is not a unit of the National Park System, and the 
designation of the national memorial shall not be construed to require 
or permit Federal funds to be expended for any purpose related to the 
national memorial.

                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
