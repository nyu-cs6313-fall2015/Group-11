            ``(10) Exception for certain research arrangements.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
                an issue if the proceeds of such issue are to be used 
                under an arrangement relating to basic research at a 
                facility--
                            ``(i) owned by a governmental unit or a 
                        501(c)(3) organization, and
                            ``(ii) the governmental unit or a 501(c)(3)

                        length contractual arrangement with a person 
                        other than a governmental unit or a 501(c)(3) 
                        organization regarding the terms for sharing 
                        the economic benefits of any products resulting 
                        from basic research, including arrangements in 
                        which those economic terms (such as exclusive 
                        or non-exclusive licenses of intellectual 
                        property and licensing fees or royalty rates) 
                        are determined in advance at the time the 
                        parties enter into the contractual arrangement.
                    ``(B) Basic research.--For purposes of subparagraph

                investigation for the advancement of scientific

                objective.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to research agreements entered into after the date of the 
enactment of this Act.
