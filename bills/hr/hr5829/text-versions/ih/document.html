            ``(10) Exception for certain research arrangements.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
                an issue if the proceeds of such issue are to be used 
                under an arrangement relating to basic research at a

                            ``(i) owned by a governmental unit or a 
                        501(c)(3) organization, and
                            ``(ii) the governmental unit or a 501(c)(3)

                        length contractual arrangement with a person 
                        other than a governmental unit or a 501(c)(3) 
                        organization regarding the terms for sharing 
                        the economic benefits of any products resulting 
                        from basic research, including arrangements in 
                        which those economic terms (such as exclusive 
                        or non-exclusive licenses of intellectual 
                        property and licensing fees or royalty rates) 
                        are determined in advance at the time the 
                        parties enter into the contractual arrangement.

                investigation for the advancement of scientific 
                knowledge not having a specific commercial 
                objective.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to research agreements entered into after the date of the 
enactment of this Act.
