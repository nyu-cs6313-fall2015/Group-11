        requirements.--Each contract entered into with a PDP sponsor

        offered by such sponsor shall provide that the PDP may not 
        enter into a contract with any pharmacy benefits manager 
        (referred to in this paragraph as a `PBM') to manage the 
        prescription drug coverage provided under such plan, or to 
        control the costs of the prescription drug coverage under such 
        plan, unless the PBM adheres to the following criteria when 
        handling personally identifiable utilization and claims data or 
        other sensitive patient data:
                    ``(A) The PBM may not transmit any personally 
                identifiable utilization or claims data, with respect 
                to a plan enrollee, to a pharmacy owned by a PBM if the 
                plan enrollee has not voluntarily elected in writing or 
                via secure electronic means to fill that particular 
                prescription at the PBM-owned pharmacy.
                    ``(B) The PBM may not require that a plan enrollee 
                use a retail pharmacy, mail order pharmacy, specialty 
                pharmacy, or other pharmacy entity providing pharmacy 
                services in which the PBM has an ownership interest or 
                that has an ownership interest in the PBM or provide an 
                incentive to a plan enrollee to encourage the enrollee 
                to use a retail pharmacy, mail order pharmacy, 
                specialty pharmacy, or other pharmacy entity providing 
                pharmacy services in which the PBM has an ownership 
                interest or that has an ownership interest in the PBM, 
                if the incentive is applicable only to such 
                pharmacies.''.

                reimbursement (as described in subparagraph (B)) of 
                pharmacies based on the cost of a drug, each contract 
                entered into with such sponsor under this part with 
                respect to the plan shall provide that the sponsor 
                shall--

                        frequently than once every 7 days, beginning 
                        with an initial update on January 1 of each 
                        year, to accurately reflect the market price of 
                        acquiring the drug;
