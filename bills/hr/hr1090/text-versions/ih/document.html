                                 A BILL


 
 To establish an Elementary Educator Science, Technology, Engineering, 
             and Mathematics (STEM) Content Coach program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Elementary Educator STEM Content 
Coach Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Numerous recent reports by national advisory groups, 
        including the President's Council of Advisors on Science and 
        Technology (PCAST) and committees of the National Academies, 
        have highlighted the need to raise student achievement in 
        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields 
        to enable the United States to maintain its competitive edge in 
        the global economy.
            (2) The PCAST report entitled ``Prepare and Inspire: K-12 
        Education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) 
        for America's Future'' states, ``The most important factor in 
        ensuring excellence is great STEM teachers, with both deep 
        content knowledge in STEM subjects and mastery of the 
        pedagogical skills required to teach these subjects well.''.
            (3) The PCAST report also recommends that the Federal 
        Government should support the professional development of all 
        teachers to help them achieve deep STEM content knowledge and 
        mastery of STEM pedagogy.
            (4) The National Academy of Sciences finds that school 
        districts need to enhance the capacity of kindergarten through 
        grade 12 teachers with content knowledge and expertise in 
        teaching in order to successfully promote effective STEM 
        education in those grades.
            (5) The Center for American Progress finds that improving 
        the elementary school teacher's knowledge of STEM-related 
        facts, concepts, and procedures is vital to our Nation's global 
        competitiveness in the 21st century.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to create a cohort of elementary 
educators with a deep content knowledge in STEM disciplines by 
providing professional development to elementary educators.

SEC. 4. ELEMENTARY EDUCATOR STEM CONTENT COACH GRANT PROGRAM.
