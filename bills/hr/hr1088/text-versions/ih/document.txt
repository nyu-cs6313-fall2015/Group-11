To require the Secretary of Transportation to develop a rule that does 
  not allow Federal funds under the disadvantaged business enterprise 
program to be used for any enterprise that is no longer eligible under 
                 such program, and for other purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Cheating Doesn't Pay Act''.

SEC. 2. RULE REGARDING DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), not later 
than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Transportation shall issue a rule that--
            (1) does not allow Federal funds under the disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program, described in section 1101(b) of 
        MAP-21 (23 U.S.C. 101 note), to be used for any enterprise that 
        is no longer eligible under such program;
            (2) 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, each 
        grant award, contract, or subcontract under the disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program prohibits any Federal funds under 
        the program to be provided to an enterprise as soon as the 
        enterprise is no longer eligible under such program;
            (3) recuperates any unobligated funds made available under 
        the disadvantaged business enterprise program to any enterprise 
        no longer eligible under the program; and
            (4) ensures that if a disadvantaged business enterprise is 
        no longer eligible to receive funds under the program, the 
        Secretary shall take such measures as are practicable to 
        expedite bidding with other eligible enterprises to complete 
        any project started by the no longer eligible enterprise.
    (b) Graduation Exception.--If a disadvantaged business enterprise 
is no longer eligible to receive funds under the program solely on the 
basis of its size, the Secretary shall allow such entity to complete 
any existing projects but shall not allow such enterprise to be 
eligible for additional funds for any new projects unless the State in 
which the enterprise is located recertifies it in accordance with 
section 1101(b) of MAP-21 (23 U.S.C. 101 note).
                                 <all>
