To enable State and local promotion of natural gas, flexible fuel, and 
                 high-efficiency motor vehicle fleets.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``State and Local Fleet Efficiency 
Act''.

SEC. 2. STATE AND LOCAL PROMOTION OF NATURAL GAS, FLEXIBLE FUEL, AND 
              HIGH-EFFICIENCY MOTOR VEHICLE FLEETS.

    (a) Definitions.--In this Act:
            (1) Fleet.--
                    (A) In general.--The term ``fleet'' means a group 
                of 20 or more light duty motor vehicles, medium duty 
                motor vehicles, or heavy duty motor vehicles capable of 
                carrying 14 or more passengers, operating primarily in 
                a metropolitan statistical area or consolidated 
                metropolitan statistical area, as established by the 
                Bureau of the Census, with a 2000 population of more 
                than 250,000, that are--
                            (i) centrally dispatched; or
                            (ii)(I) centrally fueled or capable of 
                        being centrally fueled; and
                            (II) owned, operated, leased, or otherwise 
                        controlled by a governmental entity or other 
                        person who owns, operates, leases, or otherwise 
                        controls 50 or more such vehicles, by any 
                        person who controls such person, by any person 
                        controlled by such person, or by any person 
                        under common control with such person.
                    (B) Excluded vehicles.--The term ``fleet'' does not 
                include--
                            (i) motor vehicles held for lease or rental 
                        to the general public;
                            (ii) motor vehicles held for sale by motor 
                        vehicle dealers, including demonstration motor 
                        vehicles;
                            (iii) motor vehicles used for motor vehicle 
                        manufacturer product evaluations or tests;
                            (iv) law enforcement motor vehicles;
                            (v) emergency motor vehicles; or
                            (vi) motor vehicles acquired and used for 
                        military purposes that the Secretary of Defense 
                        has certified to the Secretary of Energy must 
                        be exempt for national security reasons.
            (2) Purchase requirement.--The term ``purchase 
        requirement'' means a State or local legal requirement applying 
        to the acquisition of fleet vehicles. Such a requirement may 
        specify that when a fleet owner or operator acquires a new 
        fleet vehicle, such owner or operator may acquire only new 
        fleet vehicles that--
                    (A) utilize natural gas as a fuel;
                    (B) are flexible fuel vehicles, meaning vehicles 
                that have been warranted by their manufacturer to 
                operate on gasoline and E85, or gasoline and M85; or
                    (C) meet a technology or performance-based 
                characteristic that is commercially available.
    (b) State and Local Fleet Requirements.--Nothing in this Act or in 
any other provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of 
any State or local government to establish purchase requirements 
applicable to fleets operating primarily within the jurisdiction of the 
State or local government if such requirements are intended to further 
any policy regarding climate change, the control of air pollution, 
energy independence, or local economic benefits. No such State or local 
requirement shall be considered to be an undue burden on interstate 
commerce. A fleet operating in more than one jurisdiction in any 
calendar year shall be treated as operating primarily in the 
jurisdiction in which the largest number of vehicle miles were traveled 
by vehicles in the fleet in the 5-calendar-year period immediately 
preceding such calendar year.
    (c) Savings.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed as granting 
additional authority to State or local governments to establish 
requirements upon the manufacturers of automobiles.
                                 <all>
