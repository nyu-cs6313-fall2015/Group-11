SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2008, the violence between Mexican drug gangs 
        fighting for trafficking routes to the United States killed 
        approximately 6,000 people in Mexico, including more than 500 
        police officers and soldiers.
            (2) In the first eight weeks of 2009, more than 1,000 
        people were killed as a result of the drug war.
            (3) In March 2009, Mexico sent an additional 3,200 soldiers 
        to the border, increasing the total number of Mexican solders 
        combating drug cartels to more than 45,000.
            (4) Over 200 United States citizens have been killed in the 
        drug war, either because they were involved in the cartels or 
        were innocent bystanders.
            (5) The drug trade in Mexico include marijuana, heroin, 
        cocaine, and methamphetamine (meth).
            (6) Mexico is the conduit for most of the cocaine--
        approximately 90 percent--in the United States, the source for 
        much of the heroin consumed in this country, and the largest 
        foreign supplier of marijuana and meth to other markets.
            (7) Estimates indicate a vast majority of the cocaine 
        available in the United States market is smuggled by Mexican 
        cartels across the United States-Mexico border.
            (8) Cartels are becoming increasingly involved in the 
        trafficking of meth because of the large profit margins they 
        obtain from controlling the drug from manufacture to 
        distribution.
            (9) The drug cartels have criminal earnings in excess of 
        $25 billion per year and physically send more than $10 billion 
        a year in bulk cash back into Mexico from the United States.
            (10) According to the 2009 National Drug Threat Assessment, 
        Mexican drug trafficking organizations are the greatest drug 
        trafficking threat to the United States.
            (11) Mexico's cartels have existed for some time, but have 
        become increasingly powerful in recent years with the demise of 
        once powerful cartels in Colombia and the closure of 
        trafficking routes through Florida.
            (12) The Colombian cartels still play a role in the United 
        States drug trade.
            (13) The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) maintains 
        that the Mexican cartels now command and control the drug trade 
        and show the hallmarks of organized crime, such as organizing 
        into distinct cells with subordinate cells, including gangs, 
        which operate throughout the United States.
            (14) Mexican cartels control drug distribution in most 
        United States cities, and they are gaining strength in markets 
        that they do not yet control. The 2009 National Drug Threat 
        Assessment indicates that Mexican cartels maintain drug 
        distribution networks or supply drugs to distributors in at 
        least 230 United States cities, including in Alaska and Hawaii.
            (15) The Federal Government provides States and local 
        governments with assistance in covering the costs related to 
        the fight against the drug cartels and the prosecution of such 
        drug cases, local law enforcement along the border is in need 
        of assistance in covering expenses. Local law enforcement uses 
        its limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human 
        smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, 
        and other border security related crimes. The United States 
        shares 1,989 miles along its border with Mexico. Federal 
        assistance is required to help local law enforcement.
