United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Multimodal 
Opportunities Via Enhanced Freight Act of 2013'' or the ``MOVE Freight 
Act of 2013''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings.
        TITLE I--NATIONAL AND STATE FREIGHT POLICY AND PLANNING

Sec. 101. National freight policy.
Sec. 102. State freight plans.
          TITLE II--NATIONAL FREIGHT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT

Sec. 201. National freight infrastructure investment grants.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The rapid and cost efficient movement of goods 
        throughout the United States supply chain, and particularly 
        through United States trade gateways and corridors, is vital to 
        securing the Nation's economic future and maintaining the 
        Nation's competitiveness in world markets.
            (2) More than $16 trillion worth of freight was moved in 
        the United States in 2010, accounting for $13 trillion in 
        domestic shipments and $3 trillion in international exports and 
        imports.
            (3) Freight is forecasted to grow, with indicators showing 
        that United States shipments will more than double between 2010 
        and 2040 to roughly $39.5 trillion annually, with an estimated 
        $10.3 trillion worth of goods using multiple modes of 
        transportation each year.
            (4) By 2020, the Nation's projected surface transportation 
        infrastructure deficiencies are expected to cost the national 
        economy cumulatively almost $900 billion in gross domestic 
        product, rising to $2.7 billion through 2040.
            (5) It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to 
        support business by helping to ensure multimodal freight 
        networks that will provide reliable, efficient, and safe 
        transportation, allowing cost-effective transport of goods to 
        markets near and far.
            (6) A national campaign of strategic investment to expand 
        capacity and increase efficiency can circumvent the projected 
        loss in United States productivity and decline in global 
        competitiveness.
            (7) In establishing national policies and programs to 
        strengthen freight-related infrastructure, the President, 
        Federal officials, and other relevant stakeholders should 
        consider the critical importance of freight to United States 
        businesses and global economic competitiveness.
            (8) Under the Constitution, it is the role of the Federal 
        Government to protect and promote commerce with foreign nations 
        and among the States through all reasonable means, including 
        through investment in goods movement infrastructure.
