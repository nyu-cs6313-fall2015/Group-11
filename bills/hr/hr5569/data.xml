 allow states and local educational agencies (LEAs) to measure students' attainment of 21st Century skills (such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and collaboration) in assessing students' progress toward state academic performance standards, require LEAs to describe the data-sharing agreements they have entered into with other agencies and organizations, and prioritize the provision of school improvement funds to LEAs with the lowest-achieving schools that demonstrate a commitment to involving community partners and intermediary organizations in school improvement efforts. Amends the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 to:

 allow states to measure students' attainment of 21st century skills in assessing the career and technical education programs funded under such Act, require states to include community partners and intermediary organizations in the development of their plans for career and technical education programs, require career and technical education providers to describe how they will involve such entities in their programs, and require those providers to develop and implement data-sharing agreements with other agencies and organizations.

 require local workforce development boards to include representatives of community partners and intermediary organizations; require local workforce development plans to describe the data-sharing agreements that the local board has entered into with other agencies and organizations; allow state workforce development program performance indicators to include assessments of students' acquisition of 21st Century skills; include the development of 21st Century skills as an element of the youth workforce investment activities and adult and dislocated worker training services funded by local workforce development programs; and require states providing funding to adult education and literacy providers under the Act to consider the extent to which those providers coordinate their activities with other education, training, and social service resources in the community, including through data-sharing arrangements. Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to:

 require TRIO program providers to work, to the extent feasible, with community partners and intermediary organizations; require the Secretary of Education to encourage TRIO program providers to enter into data-sharing agreements with other agencies and organizations; require the Secretary to consider students' acquisition of 21st Century skills in assessing TRIO program effectiveness; include community partners and intermediary organizations in the partnerships for grants under the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate programs (GEAR UP); require GEAR UP providers, to the extent feasible, to enter into data-sharing agreements with other organizations or agencies; and include among GEAR UP activities those that improve the number of participating students who acquire 21st Century skills.
