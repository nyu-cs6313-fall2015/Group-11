                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from using Federal funds 
    for the position of Public Advocate, or the position of Deputy 
 Assistant Director of Custody Programs and Community Outreach, within 
   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Immigration Compliance Enforcement 
(ICE) Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) On March 26, 2013, President Obama signed into law the 
        Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 
        (Public Law 113-6).
            (2) Such Act prohibited funds made available by the Act 
        from being used to provide funding for the position of Public 
        Advocate within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
        (``ICE'') .
            (3) Following the enactment of the Consolidated and Further 
        Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, the former ICE Public 
        Advocate continued to work at ICE as Deputy Assistant Director 
        of Custody Programs and Community Outreach, a newly created 
        position.
            (4) ICE activities now defined as ``Community Outreach'' 
        are the very activities as those previously undertaken by the 
        now-defunct Office of the Public Advocate. Such activities 
        include the operation of a national hotline, the ICE Community 
        and Detainee Helpline, which uses the same telephone number as 
        a hotline used in the Office of the Public Advocate prior to 
        the enactment of the Consolidated and Further Continuing 
        Appropriations Act, 2013.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITED USES OF FUNDS.

    None of the funds made available by any Federal law may be used to 
provide funding for--
            (1) the position of Public Advocate within U.S. Immigration 
        and Customs Enforcement;
            (2) the position of Deputy Assistant Director of Custody 
        Programs and Community Outreach within U.S. Immigration and 
        Customs Enforcement; or
            (3) any other position within U.S. Customs and Immigration 
        Enforcement the functions of which are substantially the same 
        as those which--
                    (A) as of March 26, 2013, were assigned to the 
                position of Public Advocate within U.S. Immigration and 
                Customs Enforcement; or
                    (B) as of the date of the enactment of this Act, 
                were assigned to the position of Deputy Assistant 
                Director of Custody Programs and Community Outreach 
                within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
