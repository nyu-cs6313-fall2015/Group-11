_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To establish an Office of Specialized Instructional Support in the 
  Department of Education and to provide grants to State educational 
                agencies to reduce barriers to learning.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Barriers to Learning Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Interventions to increase students' bonding to school 
        promote academic success by reducing barriers to learning.
            (2) Interventions that foster students' engagement in 
        school have been shown to reduce high school dropout rates.
            (3) Interventions that strengthen students' social, 
        emotional, and decisionmaking skills also positively impact 
        their academic achievement, both in terms of higher 
        standardized test scores and better grades.
            (4) Prevention and early intervention programs that target 
        elementary school-aged students who are academically and 
        socially at risk have been shown to produce declines in special 
        education referrals and placement, suspension, grade retention, 
        and disciplinary referrals.
            (5) Students with barriers to learning, such as low levels 
        of resilience assets (such as high expectations and caring 
        relationships at school), have lower levels of academic 
        achievement both in low- and high-performing schools.
            (6) Increasing students' engagement and sense of community 
        in the school produces reductions in problem behaviors, 
        increased associations with prosocial peers, and better 
        academic performance.
            (7) School mental health programs improve educational 
        outcomes by decreasing absences and discipline referrals and 
        improving test scores.
            (8) Students who receive social-emotional support and 
        prevention services achieve better academically in school.
            (9) While it is well recognized that mental health directly 
        affects children's learning and development, in a recent study 
        one-third of school districts reported decreased funding for 
        school mental health services at the same time that two-thirds 
        reported increased need for such services.
            (10) Nearly 15 to 18 percent of children and adolescents 
        have a chronic health condition, nearly half of whom could be 
        considered disabled. School nursing provides access to high 
        quality, cost-effective care to our Nation's school children, 
        including the most vulnerable. Improving access and overall 
        health outcomes supports positive learning outcomes in our 
        schools.
            (11) School counseling programs are essential for students 
        to achieve optimal personal growth, acquire positive social 
        skills and values, set appropriate career goals, and realize 
        full academic potential to become productive, contributing 
        members of the world community.
            (12) Seventy percent of children receiving services from 
        speech-language pathologists make progress in emergent literacy 
        skills, and 75 percent make progress in word recognition, an 
        important component of literacy skills; over two-thirds of 
        classroom teachers report that students receiving these 
        services show improved reading skills in the classroom.
            (13) Use of creative arts therapies (including art therapy, 
        dance/movement therapy, and music therapy) promote learning and 
        skill acquisition (including enhanced literacy skills), 
        increased attention, improved behavior, increased 
        socialization, improved receptive/expressive language, self-
        expression, and a more positive attitude for learning.
            (14) Ninety-seven percent of children in the United States 
        spend their days at school. Therefore, the school can be an 
        important site where health and education risks (such as 
        depression, absenteeism, and substance use) may be identified 
        and timely interventions initiated.
            (15) Whole-school interventions using positive behavior 
        support have been shown to decrease behavior problems while 
        improving academic performance, as measured by standardized 
        tests in reading and mathematics.
            (16) Branches of Federal agencies need to re-evaluate 
        policies aimed at enhancing school-based mental health and 
        become more proactive in providing leadership to achieve 
        integrated, collaborative, and effective programs aimed at 
        improving the mental health of America's children.
            (17) Twenty percent of the 53 million children attending 
        school in the United States will, at some point, meet the 
        criteria for a diagnosable mental illness at a level of 
        impairment that requires some type of intervention. Thus, there 
        is the potential that over 10 million children will need some 
        type of help to meet the goals relating to emotional well-being 
        in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 
        U.S.C. 6301 et seq.).
            (18) More than three-quarters of schools have a coordinator 
        of mental health and social services in the school; nearly two-
        thirds of school districts have a coordinator who serves this 
        role; and one-half of the States have a coordinator of school 
        mental health and social services. However, there is currently 
        no person responsible for overseeing or promoting these 
        services and supports in the Department of Education.
