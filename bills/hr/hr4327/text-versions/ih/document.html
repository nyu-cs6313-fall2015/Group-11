in subsection (b), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall 
publish a cost-benefit analysis of such decision, including the likely 
financial impact of such decision on ratepayers.
    (b) Decisions.--This section applies to any decision by the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission that will--
            (1) authorize the creation of a new capacity zone; or
            (2) affect the supply and demand curves or models used to 
        determine prices at points in a capacity zone.
    (c) Prohibition.--If the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
determines, through a cost-benefit analysis published under subsection 
(a), that a decision described in subsection (b) will raise costs for 
ratepayers, then the Commission may not issue such decision.
