Sandia Pueblo Settlement Technical Amendment Act - Amends the T'uf Shur Bien Preservation Trust Area Act to require the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary), at the request of the Sandia Pueblo of New Mexico and the Secretary of the Interior, to transfer certain National Forest land to the Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust for the Pueblo, if a land exchange with the Pueblo required by that Act is not completed within 30 days of this Act's enactment.

Identifies that land as National Forest land generally depicted as "Land to be Held in Trust" on the map entitled "Sandia Pueblo Settlement Technical Amendment Act" and dated October 18, 2013.

Requires such National Forest land to remain undeveloped in its natural state.

Directs the Secretary of the Interior, with the consent of the Pueblo and after the transfer of the National Forest land is complete, to: (1) transfer to the Secretary the Pueblo's La Luz tract and a conservation easement on its Piedra Lisa tract, and (2) grant to the Secretary a right-of-way for the Piedra Lisa Trail within the Piedra Lisa tract.</summary>
