                order, not later than the sixth day after introduction

                motion are waived. Such a motion shall not be in order 
                after the House of Representatives has disposed of a 
                motion to proceed on a joint resolution. The previous 
                question shall be considered as ordered on the motion 
                to its adoption without intervening motion. The motion 
                shall not be debatable. A motion to reconsider the vote 
                by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in 
                order.
                    (C) Consideration.--The joint resolution shall be

                joint resolution and against its consideration are

                ordered on the joint resolution to its passage without 
                intervening motion except 2 hours of debate equally 
                divided and controlled by the proponent and an 
                opponent. A motion to reconsider the vote on passage of 
                the joint resolution shall not be in order.
            (3) Expedited procedure in senate.--
                    (A) Reconvening.--Upon receipt of a certification 
                under subsection (b), if the Senate would otherwise be 
                adjourned, the majority leader of the Senate, after 
                consultation with the minority leader of the Senate, 
                shall notify the Members of the Senate that, pursuant 
                to this subsection, the Senate shall convene not later 
                than the thirteenth calendar day after receipt of such

                    (B) Placement on calendar.--Upon introduction in 
                the Senate, the joint resolution shall be immediately

                            (i) In general.--Notwithstanding rule XXII 
                        of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in 
                        order at any time during the period beginning 
                        on the day after the date on which Congress 
                        receives a certification under subsection (b) 
                        and ending on the 6th day after the date of 
                        introduction of a joint resolution under 
                        paragraph (1) (even if a previous motion to the 
                        same effect has been disagreed to) to move to 
                        proceed to the consideration of the joint 
                        resolution, and all points of order against the 
                        joint resolution (and against consideration of 
                        the joint resolution) are waived. The motion to 
                        proceed is not debatable. The motion is not 
                        subject to a motion to postpone. A motion to 
                        reconsider the vote by which the motion is 
                        agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in 
                        order. If a motion to proceed to the 
                        consideration of the joint resolution is agreed 
                        to, the joint resolution shall remain the 
                        unfinished business until disposed of.
                            (ii) Consideration.--Consideration of the 
                        joint resolution, and on all debatable motions 
                        and appeals in connection therewith, shall be 
                        limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall 
                        be divided equally between the majority and 
                        minority leaders or their designees. A motion 
                        further to limit debate is in order and not 
                        debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to 
                        postpone, or a motion to proceed to the 
                        consideration of other business, or a motion to 
                        recommit the joint resolution is not in order.
                            (iii) Vote on passage.--If the Senate has 
                        voted to proceed to a joint resolution, the 
                        vote on passage of the joint resolution shall 
                        occur immediately following the conclusion of 
                        consideration of the joint resolution, and a 
                        single quorum call at the conclusion of the 
                        debate if requested in accordance with the 
                        rules of the Senate.
                            (iv) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--
                        Appeals from the decisions of the Chair 
                        relating to the application of the rules of the 
                        Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure 
                        relating to a joint resolution shall be decided 
                        without debate.
            (4) Amendment not in order.--A joint resolution of 
        disapproval considered pursuant to this subsection shall not be 
        subject to amendment in either the House of Representatives or 
        the Senate.
            (5) Coordination with action by other house.--
                    (A) In general.--If, before passing the joint 
                resolution, one House receives from the other a joint 
                resolution--
                            (i) the joint resolution of the other House 
                        shall not be referred to a committee; and
                            (ii) the procedure in the receiving House 
                        shall be the same as if no joint resolution had 
                        been received from the other House, except that 
                        the vote on passage shall be on the joint 
                        resolution of the other House.
                    (B) Treatment of joint resolution of other house.--
                If the Senate fails to introduce or consider a joint 
                resolution under this subsection, the joint resolution 
                of the House of Representatives shall be entitled to 
                expedited floor procedures under this subsection.
                    (C) Treatment of companion measures.--If, following 
                passage of the joint resolution in the Senate, the 
                Senate then receives the companion measure from the 
                House of Representatives, the companion measure shall 
                not be debatable.
                    (D) Consideration after passage.--
                            (i) In general.--If Congress passes a joint 
                        resolution, the period beginning on the date 
                        the President is presented with the joint 
                        resolution and ending on the date the President 
                        signs, allows to become law without his 
                        signature, or vetoes and returns the joint 
                        resolution (but excluding days when either 
                        House is not in session) shall be disregarded 
                        in computing the calendar day period described

                        between the majority and minority leaders or 
                        their designees.
            (6) Rules of house of representatives and senate.--This 
        subsection is enacted by Congress--
                    (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the 
                Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, and 
                as such it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, 
                respectively, but applicable only with respect to the 
                procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a 
                joint resolution, and it supersedes other rules only to 
                the extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and
                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional 
                right of either House to change the rules (so far as 
                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, 
                in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the
