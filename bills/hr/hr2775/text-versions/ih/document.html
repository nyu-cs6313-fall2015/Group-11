To condition the provision of premium and cost-sharing subsidies under 
  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act upon a certification 
that a program to verify household income and other qualifications for 
         such subsidies is operational, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CONDITIONING PROVISION OF ACA PREMIUM AND COST-SHARING 
              SUBSIDIES UPON CERTIFICATION THAT A PROGRAM TO VERIFY 
              HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND OTHER QUALIFICATIONS FOR THOSE 
              SUBSIDIES IS OPERATIONAL.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no premium tax credits 
shall be allowed under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
and no reductions in cost-sharing shall be allowed under section 1402 
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18071) 
before the date that the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
certifies to the Congress that there is in place a program that 
verifies, consistent with section 1411 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 18081), 
the household income and coverage requirements of individuals applying 
for such credits and cost-sharing reduction.
