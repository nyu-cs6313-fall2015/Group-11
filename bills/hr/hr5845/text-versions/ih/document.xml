			<paragraph id="H1AE5C975710E434D8F175D3DDCB2130F"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers is having a devastating effect on public health
			 and safety in communities across the United States. According to the
			 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdose deaths now
			 surpass traffic crashes in the number of deaths caused by injury in the
			 United States. In 2011, an average of about 110 people in the United
			 States died from drug overdose every day.</text>

			 easily obtained alternative to prescription drugs.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H35C0B917CBBB458992CA2D7ED3B464AC"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Opioid pain relievers are the most widely misused or abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly
			 referred to as <quote>CPDs</quote>) and are involved in most CPD-related overdose incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning
			 Network (commonly known as <quote>DAWN</quote>), the estimated number of emergency department visits involving nonmedical use of prescription
			 opiates or opioids increased by 112 percent, from 84,671 to 179,787,
			 between 2006 and 2010.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H71CBA16015C74991B4889451D1B93A35"><enum>(4)</enum><text>According to a report by the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors
			 (commonly referred to as <quote>NASADAD</quote>), 37 States reported an increase in admissions to treatment for heroin use during the past 2
			 years, while admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased
			 500 percent from 2000 to 2012.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HF53FD4A433364D92B1AC813865998006"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Addiction is a treatable disease. Discoveries in the science of addiction have led to advances in

			 drugs and prescription medications and resume their productive lives.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HEFB7F9DD046341B2BCEF6C90993ABD8C"><enum>(6)</enum><text>According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (commonly referred to as <quote>ONDCP</quote>), approximately 22,700,000 people in the United States needed substance use disorder treatment in
			 2013, but only 2,500,000 people received it.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0BCAE7A0A8CB4B6CBE69722B7168845D"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Effective substance abuse prevention can yield major economic dividends. Every dollar invested in
			 prevention can lead to savings between $2 and $20.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H1147388DB5F7427F86C83690851D9D41"><enum>(8)</enum><text>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, when schools and communities properly implement
			 science-validated substance abuse prevention programs, alcohol, tobacco,
			 and illicit drug abuse are reduced. Such programs help teachers, parents,
			 and health care professionals shape the perceptions of youths about the
			 risks of drug abuse.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H202E342F6925466C96DE6E7C3F06E037"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Diverting individuals with substance use disorders from criminal justice systems into
			 community-based treatment can save billions of dollars and prevent
			 sizeable numbers of crimes, arrests, and re-incarcerations over the course
			 of those individuals’ lives.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HDB6FDE39EBF845D59285D00E160D1B40"><enum>(10)</enum><text>According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, more than 1,700 tons of expired, unwanted prescription
			 medications have been collected over the past 3<fraction>1/2</fraction> years, following the
			 enactment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (Public
			 Law 111–273; 124 Stat. 2858).</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HFAB0EC5DE6934C8E8977A2B6C5F65FB3"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Research shows that combining treatment medications with behavioral therapy is the best way to
			 ensure success for most patients. Treatment approaches must be tailored to
			 address the drug abuse patterns and drug-related medical, psychiatric, and
			 social problems of each individual. Different types of medications may be
			 useful at different stages of treatment to help a patient stop abusing
			 drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid relapse.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H706DE20455F74E479CBD234B50241ED5"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Research indicates that combating the epidemic of opioid abuse, including abuse of prescription
			 painkillers and, increasingly, heroin, requires a multi-pronged approach
			 that involves reducing drug diversion, expanding delivery of existing
			 treatments (including medication-assisted treatments), expanding access to
			 overdose medications and interventions, and the development of new
			 medications for pain that can augment the existing treatment arsenal.</text>
