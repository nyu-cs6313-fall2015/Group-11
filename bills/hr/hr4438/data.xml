      <text>DEBATE - The House proceeded with 10 minutes of debate on the Kirkpatrick motion to recommit with instructions. The instructions contained in the motion seek to ensure that businesses can only claim the Research and Development credit for expenses attributable to wages if they: (1) guarantee female employees receive equal pay for equal work; (2) give priority to hiring unemployed Americans, especially veterans; and (3) do not outsource American jobs. Additionally, the motion ensures that the underlying legislation cannot take effect if it increases the deficit.</text>

  <summary>5/9/2014--Passed House amended.
American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish a permanent research tax credit that allows for: (1) 20% of the qualified or basic research expenses that exceed 50% of the average qualified or basic research expenses for the 3 preceding taxable years, and (2) 20% of amounts paid to an energy research consortium for energy research. Reduces such credit rate to 10% if a taxpayer has no qualified research expenses in any one of the 3 preceding taxable years.

Prohibits the entry of the budgetary effects of this Act on any PAYGO scorecard.</summary>
