    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Muscogee Nation of Florida Federal 
Recognition Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Muscogee Nation of Florida is comprised of lineal 
        descendants of persons who were historically part of the Creek 
        Confederacy, which relocated from Daleville, Alabama, and other 
        areas of southern Alabama to the State of Florida between 1812 
        and 1887;
            (2) those Creek persons settled in the north Florida 
        panhandle in autonomous communities (referred to in the 
        constitution of the Muscogee Nation as ``Townships''), 
        continuing the lifestyle and traditions practiced by the 
        historic Creek Nation of Alabama and Georgia;
            (3)(A) on dissolution of the Creek Confederacy, the 
        ancestors of current members of the Muscogee Nation of Florida 
        relocated and reestablished home sites, traditions, ceremonial 
        centers, tribal government (including through the traditional 
        appointment of tribal leaders), and tribal economy in rural 
        areas of the State of Florida;
            (B) the relocation described in subparagraph (A) did not 
        prevent the Nation from--
                    (i) continuing to exercise the governing powers of 
                the Nation;
                    (ii) providing services to members of the Nation; 
                or
