			<paragraph id="HFD7CC85C2359463F8C587531C258BF8D"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Land conservation
			 and farmland preservation is an important national goal that allows farmers to
			 continue to farm on their land, and allows communities to protect invaluable
			 natural resources for future generations.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HB84B4E20A0B841ACB48AA224356A6B2C"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Farmland in
			 metropolitan and frequently high-cost communities is estimated to account for
			 one-third of all farms, and 18 percent of this Nationâ€™s farmland.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H876EBB5CA652410A9E44289895214397"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In many urban
			 fringe areas farmland is rapidly disappearing, and the U.S. Department of
			 Agriculture estimates that approximately 95 million acres of farmland will be
			 taken over by sprawl and urban growth in the coming years.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H6D8912B15F6B4C0ABEBA328DB45B18F6"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Farmers and
			 landowners generally receive a significantly reduced payment for the sale of
			 development rights and conservation easements than they would receive by
			 selling the land to the private sector for development. In many instances,
			 however, these sales are treated the same under the tax code.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HCABF697B00DE4AA1BCDE894F58E12DD8"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In areas where
			 State law requires debt assumed by a municipality to be structured in the form
			 of a sinking fund, farmers and landowners may be discouraged from selling the
			 development rights of their land for conservation purposes. Since sales to
			 State and local governments will be in the form of a sinking fund, a seller may
			 not be able to pay capital gains taxes in full when the seller will not receive
			 cash payments until a future date.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HB55BB2E0300F4118BBF86DA180887140"><enum>(6)</enum><text>In urban fringe
			 areas, many communities have made a concerted effort to purchase development
			 rights to land. The land remains private, but the community gains by preserving
			 open spaces and enjoying environmental benefits. Communities will greatly
			 benefit by the Federal Government taking steps to assist municipalities in the
			 purchase of development rights.</text>
