  To provide for the conveyance of a portion of the former Air Force 
       Norwalk Defense Fuel Supply Point in Norwalk, California.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. LAND CONVEYANCE, FORMER AIR FORCE NORWALK DEFENSE FUEL 
              SUPPLY POINT, NORWALK, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Land Conveyance Authorized.--The Secretary of the Air Force may 
convey, without consideration, to the City of Norwalk, California (in 
this section referred to as the ``City''), all right, title, and 
interest of the United States in and to a parcel of real property, 
including any improvements thereon, consisting of up to 15 acres at the 
former Air Force Norwalk Defense Fuel Supply Point for the purpose of 
permitting the City to use the property for public purposes.
    (b) Condition on Conveyance.--The conveyance under subsection (a) 
is contingent upon, or may be executed concurrent with, the City 
actively assisting the United States in disposing of the residual 
portion of the former Norwalk Defense Fuel Supply Point (approximately 
36 acres) using General Services Administration disposal authority.
    (c) Application of Environmental Laws.--Nothing in this section 
shall affect the applicability of Federal, State, or local 
environmental laws and regulations, including the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 
U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), to the Department of the Air Force.
    (d) Payment of Costs of Conveyances.--
            (1) Payment required.--The Secretary of the Air Force shall 
        require the City to cover costs to be incurred by the 
        Secretary, or to reimburse the Secretary for administrative 
        costs incurred by the Secretary to carry out the conveyance 
        under subsection (a), including survey costs, costs for 
        environmental documentation related to the conveyance, and any 
        other administrative costs related to the conveyance. If 
        amounts are collected from the City in advance of the Secretary 
        incurring the actual costs, and the amount collected exceeds 
        the costs actually incurred by the Secretary to carry out the 
        conveyance, the Secretary shall refund the excess amount to the 
        City.
            (2) Treatment of amounts received.--Amounts received under 
        paragraph (1) as reimbursement for costs incurred by the 
        Secretary to carry out the conveyance under subsection (a) 
        shall be credited to the fund or account that was used to cover 
        the costs incurred by the Secretary in carrying out the 
        conveyance. Amounts so credited shall be merged with amounts in 
        such fund or account and shall be available for the same 
        purposes, and subject to the same conditions and limitations, 
        as amounts in such fund or account.
    (e) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal 
description of the real property to be conveyed under subsection (a) 
shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary of the 
Air Force.
    (f) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary of the Air 
Force may require such additional terms and conditions in connection 
with the conveyance under subsection (a) as the Secretary considers 
appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
