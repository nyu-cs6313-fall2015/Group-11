  <summary>5/6/2014--Introduced.
Amends the California Desert Protection Act of 1994 to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire up to five acres of land and interests in land, and improvements on it, outside the boundaries of Joshua Tree National Park in California, in the unincorporated village of Joshua Tree, California, for the purpose of operating a visitor center.

Instructs the Secretary to modify the boundary of the Park to include the acquired land as a noncontiguous parcel.

Allows the lands and facilities acquired under this Act to: (1) include the property currently owned by the Joshua Tree National Park Association and commonly referred to as the "Joshua Tree National Park Visitor Center"; (2) be administered as part of the Park; and (3) be acquired only with the owner's consent by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or by exchange.</summary>
