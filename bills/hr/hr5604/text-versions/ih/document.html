 To direct the Secretary of the Army to revise the management plan for 
     the conservation pool in Lake Texoma, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. LAKE TEXOMA MANAGEMENT.

    (a) Management Plan Revision.--Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, the Secretary shall revise the management plan for the 
conservation pool in Lake Texoma to ensure that--
            (1) the water surface elevation is maintained between 619 
        and 614 mean sea level;
            (2) if the water surface elevation is at or below 614 mean 
        sea level, hydroelectric power generation is only conducted 
        upon a determination by the Secretary, in consultation with the 
        Lake Texoma Advisory Committee, that there are emergency power 
        needs, including needs resulting from a natural disaster; and
            (3) additional water capacity resulting from the revision 
        under paragraph (1) may be made available for allocation and, 
        if allocated, district water suppliers will be prioritized.
    (b) Timing.--The Secretary shall make the revisions required under 
subsection (a) not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act.
    (c) Secretary Defined.--In this section, the term ``Secretary'' 
means the Secretary of the Army (acting through the Chief of 
Engineers).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
