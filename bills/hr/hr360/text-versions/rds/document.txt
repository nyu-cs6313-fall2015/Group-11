                                 AN ACT


 
To award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal to Addie Mae Collins, 
Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley to commemorate the 
  lives they lost 50 years ago in the bombing of the Sixteenth Street 
 Baptist Church, where these 4 little Black girls' ultimate sacrifice 
          served as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress Finds the following:
            (1) September 15, 2013, will mark 50 years since the lives 
        of Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and 
        Cynthia Wesley were suddenly taken by a bomb planted in the 
        Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
            (2) The senseless and premature death of these 4 little 
        Black girls sparked ``The Movement that Changed the World''.
            (3) On that tragic Sunday in September of 1963, the world 
        took notice of the violence inflicted in the struggle for equal 
        rights.
            (4) The fact that 4 innocent children lost their lives as 
        they prepared for Sunday School shook the world's conscience.
            (5) This tragedy galvanized the Civil Rights Movement and 
        sparked a surge of momentum that helped secure the passage of 
        the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and later the Voting Rights Act of 
        1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.
            (6) Justice was delayed for these 4 little Black girls and 
        their families until 2002, 39 years after the bombing, when the 
        last of the 4 Klansmen responsible for the bombing was charged 
        and convicted of the crime.
            (7) The 4 little Black girls are emblematic of so many who 
        have lost their lives for the cause of freedom and equality, 
        including Virgil Ware and James Johnny Robinson who were 
        children also killed within hours of the 1963 church bombing.
            (8) The legacy that these 4 little Black girls left will 
        live on in the minds and hearts of us all for generations to 
        come.
            (9) Their extraordinary sacrifice sparked real and lasting 
        change as Congress began to aggressively pass legislation that 
        ensured equality.
            (10) Sixteenth Street Baptist Church remains a powerful 
        symbol of the movement for civil and human rights and will host 
        the 50th anniversary ceremony on Sunday, September 15, 2013.
            (11) It is befitting that Congress bestow the highest 
        civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, in 2013 to the 4 
        little Black girls, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole 
        Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley, posthumously in recognition of 
        the 50th commemoration of the historical significance of the 
        bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church.
