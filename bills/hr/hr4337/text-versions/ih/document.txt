                                 A BILL


 
    To direct the Joint Committee on the Library to accept a statue 
depicting Pierre L'Enfant from the District of Columbia and to provide 
 for the permanent display of the statue in the United States Capitol.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Pierre L'Enfant was born in France in 1754, and 
        traveled to the United States to serve with the United States 
        in the Revolutionary War.
            (2) Pierre L'Enfant was an engineer and architect, and in 
        1791 he developed the unique and exceptional design for the 
        Nation's capital that laid the framework for the modern-day 
        District of Columbia that is followed and maintained until 
        today.
            (3) L'Enfant's remarkable design envisioned a 
        distinguishable federal and residential city with diagonal 
        streets propelling from Congress and the President's home, 
        beautiful boulevards on local streets and neighborhoods, and 
        open spaces for monuments, memorials, and historical 
        structures, all of which largely remain intact, protected as a 
        historical treasure.
            (4) The United States Capitol does not currently 
        appropriately recognize the contributions of Pierre L'Enfant.

SEC. 2. ACCEPTANCE OF STATUE OF PIERRE L'ENFANT FOR PLACEMENT IN UNITED 
              STATES CAPITOL.

    (a) Acceptance.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Joint Committee on the Library shall accept 
from the District of Columbia the donation of a statue depicting Pierre 
L'Enfant, subject to the terms and conditions that the Joint Committee 
considers appropriate.
    (b) Placement.--The Joint Committee shall place the statue accepted 
under subsection (a) in a suitable permanent location in the United 
States Capitol.
                                 <all>
