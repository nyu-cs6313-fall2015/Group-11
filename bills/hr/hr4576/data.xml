Directs the Secretary to require all railroad carriers to establish and implement a fatigue management plan that identifies and evaluates any fatigue related railroad safety hazards on its system and to determine the degree of risk associated with each hazard.

Directs the Secretary biannually to require any railroad carrier implementing a positive train control system to report to the Secretary on the progress of the implementation.

Requires the Secretary to issue regulations to require that on-track safety programs include requiring implementation of redundant signal protection, such as shunting, for maintenance-of-way work crews who depend on a train dispatcher to provide signal protection.
