                                 A BILL


 
 To designate the Philippines under section 244 of the Immigration and 
 Nationality Act to permit nationals of the Philippines to be eligible 
           for temporary protected status under such section.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Filipino Temporary Protected Status 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that the extraordinary and 
temporary conditions caused by flooding and other catastrophic damage 
wrought by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines qualifies the Philippines 
for designation under subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 244(b)(1) of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(b)(1)), pursuant to 
which nationals of the Philippines would be eligible for temporary 
protected status in the United States.

SEC. 3. DESIGNATION FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY PROTECTED 
              STATUS.

    (a) Designation.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of section 244 of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a), the 
        Philippines shall be treated as if it had been designated under 
        subsection (b) of such section, subject to the provisions of 
        this section.
            (2) Period of designation.--The initial period of such 
        designation shall begin on the date of the enactment of this 
        Act and shall remain in effect for 18 months.
    (b) Aliens Eligible.--In applying section 244 of such Act pursuant 
to the designation made under this section, subject to section 
244(c)(3) of such Act, an alien who is a national of the Philippines 
deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 244(c)(1) of such Act 
only if the alien--
            (1) has been continuously physically present in the United 
        States since November 8, 2013;
            (2) is admissible as an immigrant, except as otherwise 
        provided under section 244(c)(2)(A) of such Act, and is not 
        ineligible for temporary protected status under section 
        244(c)(2)(B) of such Act; and
            (3) registers for temporary protected status in a manner 
        that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish.
    (c) Consent To Travel Abroad.--The Secretary of Homeland Security 
shall give the prior consent to travel abroad described in section 
244(f)(3) of such Act to an alien who is granted temporary protected 
status pursuant to the designation made under this section, if the 
alien establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Homeland 
Security that emergency and extenuating circumstances beyond the 
control of the alien require the alien to depart for a brief, temporary 
trip abroad. An alien returning to the United States in accordance with 
such an authorization shall be treated the same as any other returning 
alien provided temporary protected status under section 244 of such 
Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
