following:

``SEC. 343. CARRIAGE OF NETWORK STATION SIGNALS IN CERTAIN COUNTIES.

    ``(a) Subscriber Election.--A cable operator or satellite carrier 
shall, at the election of a subscriber in a covered county with respect 
to a television network, provide to such subscriber--
            ``(1) retransmission of the signal of any local network 
        station that such operator or carrier is required to retransmit 
        to such subscriber without regard to this section;
            ``(2) an in-State, adjacent-market network station 
        retransmission; or
            ``(3) both such retransmissions.
    ``(b) Relationship to Local Signal Carriage Requirements.--If a 
subscriber elects to receive only an in-State, adjacent-market network 
station retransmission under subsection (a)--
            ``(1) the provision of such retransmission to such 
        subscriber shall be deemed to fulfill any obligation of the 
        cable operator or satellite carrier to provide to such 
        subscriber the signal of a local network station under section 
        338, 614, or 615; and
            ``(2) in the case of a satellite carrier that has been 
        recognized as a qualified carrier under section 119(g) of title 
        17, United States Code, the provision of such retransmission 
        instead of the signal of a local network station shall not 
        affect the status of the satellite carrier as a qualified 
        carrier for purposes of such section and section 342 of this 
        Act.
    ``(c) Requirement Subject to Technical Feasibility for Satellite 
Carriers.--A satellite carrier is required to provide a retransmission 
under subsection (a) only to the extent that such provision is 
technically feasible, as determined by the Commission.
    ``(d) Treatment of In-State, Adjacent-Market Network Station 
Retransmissions by Cable Operators.--
            ``(1) Retransmission consent exception.--Section 325(b) 
        shall not apply to an in-State, adjacent-market network station 
        retransmission by a cable operator to a subscriber residing in 
        a covered county.
            ``(2) Deemed significantly viewed.--In the case of an in-
        State, adjacent-market network station retransmission by a 
        cable operator to a subscriber residing in a covered county, 
        the signal of such station is deemed to be significantly viewed 
        in such county within the meaning of section 76.54 of the 
        Commission's regulations (47 C.F.R. 76.54).
    ``(e) Definitions.--In this section--

        market network station retransmission' have the meanings given 
        such terms in section 119(d) of title 17, United States Code, 
        except that, in the case of a cable operator, any reference to 
        a satellite carrier or a subscriber of a satellite carrier 
        shall be considered to be a reference to a cable operator or a 
        subscriber of a cable operator, respectively; and
