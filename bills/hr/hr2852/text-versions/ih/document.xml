			 finds the following:</text>
				<paragraph id="HE9E260DACB5042AAAB1493A3A8DCA259"><enum>(1)</enum><text>In enacting
			 section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (adding section 703(m) of the Civil
			 Rights Act of 1964), Congress reaffirmed its understanding that unlawful
			 discrimination is often difficult to detect and prove because discriminators do
			 not usually admit their discrimination and often try to conceal their true
			 motives. Section 703(m) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 expressly approved
			 so-called “mixed motive” claims, providing that an unlawful employment practice
			 is established when a protected characteristic was a motivating factor for any
			 employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the
			 practice.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="H26A96901A4BE494AA9430DC30F24E898"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Congress enacted
			 amendments to other civil rights statutes, including the Age Discrimination in
			 Employment Act of 1967 (referred to in this section as the <term>ADEA</term>),
			 the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Rehabilitation Act of
			 1973, but Congress did not expressly amend those statutes to address mixed
			 motive discrimination.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="HCE042A7925844629BFB1BBB714CC9C99"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In the case of
			 Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U.S. 167 (2009), the Supreme Court
			 held that, because Congress did not expressly amend the ADEA to address mixed
			 motive claims, such claims were unavailable under the ADEA, and instead the
			 complainant bears the burden of proving that a protected characteristic or
			 protected activity was the “but for” cause of an unlawful employment practice.
			 This decision has significantly narrowed the scope of protections afforded by
			 the statutes that were not expressly amended in 1991 to address mixed motive
			 claims.</text>

				<paragraph id="H5BE502CEE7A743739D957BA6A57EA320"><enum>(1)</enum><text>to clarify
			 congressional intent that mixed motive claims shall be available, and that a

			 activity was the “but for” cause of an unlawful employment practice, under the
			 ADEA and similar civil rights provisions;</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="H516F8808F9BD42788E6CE63E25A6B502"><enum>(2)</enum><text>to reject the
			 Supreme Court’s reasoning in the Gross decision that Congress’ failure to amend
			 any statute other than title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (with respect
			 to discrimination claims), in enacting section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of
			 1991, suggests that Congress intended to disallow mixed motive claims under
