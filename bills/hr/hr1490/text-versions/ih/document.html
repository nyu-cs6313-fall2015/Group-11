            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(b) Visual Recording.--(1) The Secretary shall prescribe

patient during the course of furnishing care under this title is 
carried out only with the full and informed consent of the patient or, 
in appropriate cases, a representative thereof.
    ``(2) The Secretary may waive the requirement for informed consent 
under paragraph (1) with respect to the visual recording of a patient

            ``(A) pursuant to a determination by a physician or 
        psychologist that such recording is medically necessary;
            ``(B) pursuant to a warrant or order of a court of 
        competent jurisdiction; or
            ``(C) in a public setting where a person would not have a 
        reasonable expectation to privacy, such as a waiting room or 
        hallway, and such recording is for general security purposes 
        not particularized to the patient.
    ``(3) In this subsection, the term `visual recording' means the 
recording or transmission of images or video.''.
