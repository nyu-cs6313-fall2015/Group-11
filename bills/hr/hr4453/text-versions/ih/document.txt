                an asset and reports the income from the sale using the 
                installment method under section 453, the treatment of 
                all payments received shall be governed by the 
                provisions of this paragraph applicable to the taxable 
                year in which such sale was made.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply
