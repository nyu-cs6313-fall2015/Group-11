  <summary>5/15/2014--Introduced.
Bureau Advisory Opinion Act - Amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to require the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to: (1) establish a procedure to respond to specific inquiries by a covered person concerning conformance of prospective conduct with federal consumer financial law, and (2) issue an opinion in response to the inquiry within 90 days (with a single allowable extension of another 45 days).

(A "covered person" under the Act is: (1) any person that engages in offering or providing a consumer financial product or service; and (2) any affiliate of that person if the affiliate acts as a service provider to the person.)

Creats a rebuttable presumption in any action brought under federal consumer financial law that any conduct for which the Director has issued an opinion that it is in conformity with the opinion is indeed in compliance with federal consumer financial law.

Exempts such inquiries and advisory opinions from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.</summary>
