Directs the Commission to use the results of the study and analyses of existing federal data relating to Native children to:\n\n develop plans and goals for federal policy relating to Native children informed by accurate child well-being measures; recommend modifications and improvements to programs that serve Native children at the federal, state, and tribal level; recommend improvements to the collection of data regarding Native children and the programs that serve them; and identify models of successful federal, state, and tribal programs in the areas studied by the Commission. Requires the Commission to report to the President, Congress, and the White House Council on Native American Affairs on its findings, conclusions, and recommendations for appropriate legislative and administrative action."
