    (a) Suspension and Debarment Process.--Section 1229(g) of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 
110-181; 5 U.S.C. App.) is amended by adding at the end the following 
new paragraph:

                out the duties, responsibilities, and authorities set 
                forth under this section, the Inspector General (or the 
                Inspector General's designee) may refer a potential 
                suspension or debarment case described in subparagraph 
                (B) to the lead agency for that suspension or

                General shall request the Interagency Committee to 
                resolve the issue of which agency is the lead agency, 
                in accordance with section 873 of the Duncan Hunter
