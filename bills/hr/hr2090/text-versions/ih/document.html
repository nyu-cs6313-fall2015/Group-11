                this section is adequately safe (as such term is 
                defined in paragraph (2)), the Secretary shall grant 
                provisional approval and the drug may be introduced 
                into interstate commerce on or after the date such 
                provisional approval is granted.
                    ``(B) Treatment of provisional approval status.--
                The provisional approval of a drug under subparagraph 
                (A) shall be treated in the same manner as approval of 
                a drug under section 505 of this Act or section 351 of 
                the Public Health Service Act, except that such 
                provisional approval shall be subject to the
