                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow taxpayers to assign 
 to another taxpayer the amount of the unused charitable deduction for 
                 qualified conservation contributions.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Conservation Empowerment 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO ASSIGN UNUSED CHARITABLE DEDUCTION FOR QUALIFIED 
              CONSERVATION CONTRIBUTIONS.

    (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 170 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to carryover of excess contributions) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(3) Excess qualified contribution contributions.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Any amount of the excess 
                qualified conservation contributions for any taxable 
                year may be assigned by the taxpayer to any other 
                person. 90 percent of the amount so assigned shall be 
                treated as contributions made by such other person and 
                not by the taxpayer, and the remainder of the amount so 
                assigned shall not be treated as charitable 
                contributions.
                    ``(B) Excess conservation contributions.--For 
                purposes of this paragraph, the term `excess 
                conservation contributions' means, with respect to any 
                taxable year, the lesser of--
                            ``(i) the amount which would, by reason of 
                        this subsection or any other provision of this 
                        section, be treated as a charitable 
                        contribution paid in a succeeding taxable year, 
                        over
                            ``(ii) the qualified conservation 
                        contributions paid (or treated as paid) during 
                        the taxable year.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act.
                                 <all>
