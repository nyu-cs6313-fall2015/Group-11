during a calendar year, the committee shall submit a notification to 
the Commission containing the name of the committee (and, in the case 
of an authorized committee of a candidate, the name of the candidate 
and the office sought by the candidate), the identification of the 
contributor, and the date of receipt and amount of the contributions 
involved.
    ``(ii) If, at any time after a political committee is required to 
submit a notification under this subparagraph with respect to a 
contributor during a calendar year, the political committee receives 
additional contributions from that contributor during that year, the 
committee shall submit an additional notification under clause (i) with 
respect to such contributor each time the aggregate amount of the 
additional contributions received from the contributor during the year 
equals or exceeds $1,000 (excluding the amount of any contribution for 
which information is required to be included in a previous notification 
under this subparagraph).
    ``(iii) The political committee shall submit the notification 
required under this subparagraph with respect to a contributor--
            ``(I) in the case of a notification described in clause 
        (i), not later than 48 hours after the date on which the 
        aggregate amount of contributions received from the contributor 
        during the calendar year first equals or exceeds $1,000; or
            ``(II) in the case of an additional notification described 
        in clause (ii), not later than 48 hours after the date on which 
        the aggregate amount of contributions received from the

committee to such authorized committee.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to contributions received by a political committee 
under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 during 2014 or any 
succeeding year, except that nothing in such amendment may be construed 
to require a political committee which does not receive contributions 
during the portion of 2014 which occurs after the date of the enactment 
of this Act to meet the requirements of section 304(a)(6)(A) of the 
Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended by subsection (a).
