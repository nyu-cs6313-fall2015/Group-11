SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The turmoil in the Middle East poses a serious threat 
        to United States national security interests and requires 
        cooperation with allies that are willing to work with the 
        United States in pursuit of shared objectives.
            (2) The October 31, 1998, Memorandum of Agreement signed by 
        President Clinton and Prime Minister Netanyahu commits the 
        United States to working jointly with Israel towards enhancing 
        Israel's defensive and deterrent capabilities and upgrading the 
        framework of the United States-Israel strategic and military 
        relationships, as well as the technological cooperation between 
        both countries.
            (3) On August 16, 2007, the United States and Israel signed 
        a Memorandum of Understanding reaffirming United States 
        commitment to the security of Israel and establishing a 10-year 
        framework for incremental increases in United States military 
        assistance to Israel.
            (4) The Memorandum of Understanding signed two years later 
        on January 16, 2009 reaffirmed the United States commitment and 
        noted ``the security, military and intelligence cooperation 
        between the United States and Israel''.
            (5) The United States and Israel conduct a semi-annual 
        Strategic Dialogue. The Department of State, in a statement 
        following the July 12, 2012, meeting of the Strategic Dialogue, 
        noted that the discussions focused on such issues of mutual 
        concern as ``Iran's continued quest to develop nuclear weapons, 
        which the United States and Israel are both determined to 
        prevent'' and ``how the continued violence of the Syrian regime 
        against its citizens [assisted by Iran and Hezbollah] could 
        also lead to severe consequences for the entire region''.

SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    Congress declares that Israel is a major strategic partner of the 
United States.

security.

SEC. 104. STATEMENT OF UNITED STATES POLICY REGARDING ISRAEL'S DEFENSE 
              SYSTEMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress--
            (1) commends the first phase completion of the David's 
        Sling Weapon System (DSWS) by the Israel Missile Defense 
        Organization and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, which is 
        designed to provide additional opportunities for interception 
        by the joint United States-Israel Arrow Weapon System (Arrow 2 
        and Arrow 3);
            (2) congratulates the Israel Missile Defense Organization 
        and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency on successfully executing 
        the Arrow 3 flyout of a more advanced interceptor, which will 
        improve Israel's defenses against upper tier ballistic missile 
        threats from nations including Iran;
            (3) recognizes that during Operation Pillar of Defense in 
        November 2012, Israel deployed Iron Dome short-range rocket 
        defense batteries to intercept Hamas-launched rockets fired 
        from Gaza--of those rockets that posed a threat to the life of 
        Israeli citizens, 80 to 85 percent were successfully 
        intercepted, saving countless lives; and
            (4) agrees that, as stated by former Secretary of Defense 
        Leon Panetta, ``Iron Dome performed, I think it's fair to say, 
        remarkably well during the recent escalation . . . Iron Dome 
        does not start wars. It helps prevent wars.''.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It should be the policy of the United 
States that the President, acting through the Secretary of Defense and 
the Secretary of State, should provide assistance, upon request by the 
Government of Israel, for the enhancement of the David's Sling Weapon 
System, the enhancement of the joint United States-Israel Arrow Weapon 
System (Arrow 2 and Arrow 3), and the procurement and enhancement of 
the Iron Dome short-range rocket defense system for purposes of 
intercepting short-range rockets, missiles, and other projectiles 
launched against Israel.

SEC. 105. REPORT ON OTHER MATTERS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States and Israel should continue

        capabilities, including through the transfer of advanced combat 
        aircraft, active phased array radar, military tanker-
        transports, other multi-mission military aircraft, advanced or 
        specialized munitions, and through joint training and exercise 
        opportunities in the United States;
            (2) the United States and Israel should expeditiously 
        conclude an updated Memorandum of Understanding regarding 
        United States security assistance in order to help Israel meet 
        its unique security requirements and uphold its qualitative 
        military edge;
            (3) the United States should ensure that Israel has timely 
        access to important military equipment, including by augmenting 
        the forward deployed United States War Reserve Stockpile in 
        Israel and by continuing to provide Israel with critical 
        military equipment and spare parts through the Department of 
        Defense's Excess Defense Articles program; and
            (4) the United States should continue to support Israel's 
        inherent right of self-defense.

            (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of

                and efforts identified in the report required under

                22 U.S.C. 8604(b)); and

Israel satisfies, and as long as Israel continues to satisfy, the 
requirements for inclusion in such program specified in such section.

SEC. 107. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Department of State should 
continue and, to the furthest extent practicable, increase its 
coordination on monitoring and combating anti-Semitism with the 
Government of Israel.
