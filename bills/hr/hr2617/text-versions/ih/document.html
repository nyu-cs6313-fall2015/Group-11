        Moon;
            (3) the 1970 Apollo 13 mission, which was aborted due to a 
        serious malfunction en route to the Moon, also circled the

            (4) the Apollo lunar program was one of the greatest 
        achievements in American history;
            (5) as commercial enterprises and foreign nations acquire 
        the ability to land on the Moon it is necessary to protect the 
        Apollo lunar landing sites for posterity; and
            (6) establishing the Historical Park under this Act will 
        expand and enhance the protection and preservation of the
