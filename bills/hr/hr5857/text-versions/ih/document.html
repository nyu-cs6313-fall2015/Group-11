        be collected at the same time as, and as a part of, such 
        installment. The part of the deficiency so prorated to any 
        installment the date for payment of which has arrived shall be 
        paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary. This subsection 
        shall not apply if the deficiency is due to negligence, to 
        intentional disregard of rules and regulations, or to fraud 
        with intent to evade tax.
