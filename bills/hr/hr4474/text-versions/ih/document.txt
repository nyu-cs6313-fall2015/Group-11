        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi)(III))) for purposes

        with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney 
        General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security, after

        General, may suspend the application of paragraph (1) for 
        either or both of the groups referred to in paragraph (1) in 
        such Secretary's sole and unreviewable discretion.

        212(a)(3)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1182(a)(3)(B)) shall not apply to an alien, with respect to the 
        alien's activities undertaken in association with the Kurdistan 
        Democratic Party or the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, if the 
        alien is applying for a nonimmigrant visa or presents himself 
        or herself for inspection to an immigration officer at a port 
        of entry as a nonimmigrant or is applying in the United States 
        for nonimmigrant status, unless a consular officer or the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security--
                    (A) knows, or has reasonable grounds to believe, 
                that the alien poses a threat to the safety and 
                security of the United States; or
                    (B) otherwise believes, in his or her discretion, 
                that the alien does not warrant a visa, admission to 
                the United States, or a grant of nonimmigrant status in 
                the totality of the circumstances.
            (2) Exception.--The Secretary of State, after consultation 
        with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney

        the Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement this 
        subsection in consultation with the Attorney General.
            (4) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection may be 
        construed to alter an alien's burden of demonstrating 
        admissibility under the immigration laws of the United States.
