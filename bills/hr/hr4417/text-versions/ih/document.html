To direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resources 
  study to determine the suitability and feasibility of entering into 
public-private partnerships to operate federally owned golf courses in 
           the District of Columbia, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE STUDY AND REPORT.

    (a) Study Process and Completion.--The Secretary of the Interior, 
acting through the Director of the National Park Service, shall conduct 
a special resources study to determine the suitability and feasibility 
of entering into public-private partnerships with non-Federal entities 
to operate East Potomac Golf Course, Langston Golf Course, and Rock 
Creek Park Golf Course, located in the District of Columbia. The 
Secretary shall conduct the study in accordance with section 8(c) of 
Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5(c)).
    (b) Considerations.--In conducting the study pursuant to subsection 
(a), the Secretary shall assume that--
            (1) one of the three golf courses will be a world-class, 
        tournament-quality public course, with playing fees 
        commensurate with such courses;
            (2) the other two golf courses shall be public courses of 
        substantially similar quality to top-ranked courses owned by 
        cities, towns, counties, and States; and
            (3) the playing fees for the two courses referred to in 
        paragraph (2) shall remain the same as they are on the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, but shall be indexed annually to the 
        Consumer Price Index as determined by the Bureau of Labor 
        Statistics.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date on which funds 
are made available to carry out this Act, the Secretary shall submit to 
the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report 
containing--
            (1) the results of the study, including a determination of 
        which golf course would be best suitable as the world-class, 
        tournament-quality public course referred to in subsection 
        (b)(1); and
            (2) any recommendations of the Secretary.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
