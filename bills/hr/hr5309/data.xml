  <summary>9/8/2014--Passed House without amendment.
Tsunami Warning, Education, and Research Act of 2014 - (Sec. 4) Amends the Tsunami Warning and Education Act to expand the tsunami forecasting and warning program operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the National Weather Service (NWS).

Consolidates separate tsunami warning systems into a single warning system capable of: (1) forecasting tsunami anywhere in the Pacific and Arctic Ocean regions and providing adequate warnings; and (2) forecasting and providing adequate warnings in areas of the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico. Requires the system to support international tsunami forecasting and warning efforts.

Requires: (1) NOAA to support or maintain tsunami warning centers as part of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and develop uniform operational procedures for the centers, (2) warning centers to maintain a fail-safe warning capability and an ability to perform back-up duties for each other, and (3) the NWS to coordinate with the centers.

(Sec. 5) Modifies the tsunami hazard mitigation program to provide for: (1) technical and financial assistance; (2) the integration of tsunami preparedness and mitigation programs into ongoing state-based hazard warning, resilience planning, and risk management activities; (3) activities to support the development of regional risk assessments; and (4) dissemination of guidelines and standards for community planning, education, and training products, programs, and tools.

(Sec. 6) Expands the tsunami research program, including by adding a standards development component, requiring development of the technical basis for validation of tsunami maps and models, and authorizing NOAA to develop a pilot project for near-field tsunami forecast development for the west coast's Cascadia region.

(Sec. 7) Revises requirements for support of the International Tsunami Warning System and operation of the International Tsunami Information Center.

(Sec. 8) Directs NOAA to designate its Ocean Exploration Advisory Working Group to serve as the Tsunami Science and Technology Advisory Panel to provide advice on matters regarding tsunami science, technology, and regional preparedness.

(Sec. 9) Requires a report to Congress on implementation of the Act, including concerning the standardization of warnings for other coastal flooding events.

(Sec. 10) Reauthorizes the Act through FY2017.

(Sec. 11) Directs NOAA to develop formal outreach activities to improve tsunami education and awareness and foster resilient communities and convene a coordinating committee to assist in the national tsunami hazard mitigation program.</summary>
