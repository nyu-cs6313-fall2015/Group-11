    To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to 
authorize a national elementary and secondary service-learning program 
  that promotes student academic achievement, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Engaging Students Through Service 
Learning Act''.

SEC. 2. K-12 SERVICE-LEARNING PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end 
the following:

``PART E--ENHANCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF K-12 EDUCATION THROUGH SERVICE 
                                LEARNING

``SEC. 2501. FINDINGS.

    ``The Congress finds as follows:
            ``(1) Students learn best when they are actively engaged in 
        meaningful and challenging learning experiences that encourage 
        higher order skills development, critical thinking, and problem 
        solving.
            ``(2) Service learning is a pedagogy that encompasses key 
        elements of effective teaching and learning, including active 
        learning, authentic experiences, opportunities for peer 
        collaboration, problem solving, student leadership and 
        empowerment, and cognitively challenging academic activities.
            ``(3) Students invest themselves in learning when their 
        educational experiences have personal meaning to them and are 
        connected to authentic, real issues in their everyday lives.
            ``(4) In service learning, students apply their knowledge 
        and skills to solve actual community problems and experience 
        the real-world value of what they are learning in school. 
        Service learning can therefore have a powerful effect on 
        students, increasing their academic engagement, their civic 
        engagement and their social and emotional development.
            ``(5) Service learning can have a powerful effect on 
        students, helping them to increase their academic engagement 
        and performance, their civic engagement and desire to help 
        others, and their social-emotional learning in areas related to 
        21st century skill acquisition, such as task persistence, 
        intellectual curiosity, and ability to work in teams.
            ``(6) In service learning, students connect to the 
        community and to their classmates in ways that are far more 
        powerful than simple cooperative learning.
            ``(7) Service learning has been found to promote behavioral 
        and dispositional factors that mediate students' educational 
        success such as greater motivation for school, engagement in 
        learning tasks, building of self-efficacy and self-esteem, and 
        propensity to engage in pro-social behaviors.
            ``(8) Research has demonstrated that test scores of 
        students who participated in service learning are higher in 
        reading, writing, mathematics, social studies, and science than 
        those of non-participants.
            ``(9) High-quality service learning will improve student 
        achievement and our schools because it employs effective, 
        experiential learning strategies associated with student 
        engagement in academic work and preparation for success in 
        college and the workplace, engages students in solving complex 
        problems, probes for deeper learning, and seeks opportunities 
        for students to transfer knowledge from one context to another.
            ``(10) Principals report that service learning has a 
        positive impact on teacher satisfaction, school climate, 
        academic achievement, and school engagement.
            ``(11) Teachers who use service learning in the classroom 
        as a type of positive teaching strategy achieve better results 
        in a variety of academic and behavioral categories than those 
        who don't, are more effective, challenged, and energized, and 
        are more likely to remain within their chosen profession.
            ``(12) Only an estimated 24 percent of the approximately 
        53,300,000 K-12 youth in the United States are given the 
        opportunity to engage in any kind of service-learning 
        experience, a decline from 32 percent in 1999.
            ``(13) Schools in high-poverty areas are less likely to 
        employ service learning as a teaching strategy, yet research 
        has shown this is a particularly effective pedagogy for use in 
        such schools. Service learning can significantly reduce the 
        achievement gap between affluent and low-income students. Low-
        income students who participated in service opportunities have 
        better school attendance and grades than low-income students 
        who do not participate.
            ``(14) There is a need for a rigorous and focused 
        initiative to demonstrate and broadly promote high-quality 
        service learning that enhances teacher effectiveness, improves 
        student learning and educational success, and positively 
        affects school climate.
            ``(15) State educational agencies are the only entities 
        with comprehensive, statewide responsibility for the quality of 
        learning within a State.

``SEC. 2502. PURPOSE.

    ``The purpose of this part is to authorize a national service-
learning program that will expand opportunities for students in 
elementary and secondary schools to engage in high-quality service 
learning that--
            ``(1) promotes student achievement in academic subjects, 
        including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics;
            ``(2) incorporates 21st century skills, such as critical 
        thinking, problem solving and collaboration;
            ``(3) integrates content knowledge and use of technology;
            ``(4) enhances school climate and civic engagement; and
            ``(5) prepares students for college or a career.

``SEC. 2503. NATIONAL ACTIVITIES.

    ``The Secretary shall reserve funds for national activities as 
follows:
            ``(1) The Secretary shall reserve not more than 10 percent 
        of the appropriation for this program in any fiscal year to

                    ``(A) to provide technical assistance to State 
                educational agencies to develop and expand the capacity 
                of local educational agencies to improve teacher 
                quality, school climate, and educational outcomes by 
                providing an infrastructure for sustainable service-
                learning efforts through vision and leadership, 
                professional development, curriculum and assessment, 
                school-community collaborations, and continuous 
                improvement; and
                    ``(B) to provide oversight, coordinate with key 
                Federal education initiatives, foster sustainability, 
                provide evidence for the strengths and limitations of 
                service-learning practices, and disseminate study 
                findings.
            ``(2) The Secretary shall reserve not more than 10 of the 
        appropriation for this program in any fiscal year percent for 
        research and evaluation activities, including a study,

                    ``(C) Identifying, tracking, and measuring the

                with real-world problem-solving opportunities,
