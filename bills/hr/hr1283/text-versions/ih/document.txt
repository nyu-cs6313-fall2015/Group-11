    Section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648), is amended by

    ``(o) Main Street Stabilization.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Administration shall establish a 
        grant program for small business development centers in 
        accordance with this subsection. To be eligible for the 
        program, a small business development center must be in good 
        standing and comply with the other requirements of this 
        section. Funds made available through the program shall be used 
        to--
                    ``(A) develop business advisory capacity to provide 
                expert consulting and education to assist small 
                businesses and to, in areas of high demand, shorten the 
                response time of small business development centers, 
                and, in rural areas, support added outreach in remote 
                communities;
                    ``(B) develop a portfolio of online survival and 
                growth tools and resources that struggling small 
                business concerns can utilize through the Internet;
                    ``(C) deploy additional resources to help specific 
                industry sectors with a high presence of small business 
                concerns, which shall be targeted toward clusters of 
                small businesses with similar needs and build upon best 
                practices from earlier assistance; and
                    ``(D) develop a formal listing of financing options 
                for small business capital access.
            ``(2) Award size limit.--The Administration may not award 
        an entity more than $250,000 in grant funds under this 
        subsection.
            ``(3) Authority.--Subject to amounts approved in advance in 
        appropriations Acts and separate from amounts approved to carry 
        out the program established in subsection (a)(1), the 
        Administration may make grants or enter into cooperative 
        agreements to carry out this subsection.
            ``(4) Authorization.--There is authorized to be 
        appropriated not more than $2,500,000 for the purposes of 
        carrying out this subsection for each of the fiscal years 2014 
        and 2015.''.
