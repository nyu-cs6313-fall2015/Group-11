Honoring the Hiring of Heroes Act - Directs the Secretaries of Labor and Veterans Affairs (VA) to: (1) jointly establish a program to award nonmonetary Employment Salute Awards to employers for veteran-friendly employment practices; and (2) establish criteria, in coordination with the Secretaries of Defense (DOD) and Commerce, for determining award recipients.

Directs the Secretary of Labor to: (1) establish different categories of employers eligible for the awards based on the number of employees they have, and (2) publicize the award recipients by listing them in a separate section of the Department of Labor's website.

Authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assess a reasonable application fee on employers seeking such an award. Establishes an Employment Salute Award Fund into which those fees are to be deposited for use in carrying out the award program.</summary>
