_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for improved 
   compliance with the requirements of the earned income tax credit.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Earnings Advancement and Recovery 
Now Act'' or the ``EARN Act''.

SEC. 2. DEDICATION OF EITC COMPLIANCE SAVINGS TO EXPANDING THE EITC.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The March 2014 report of the Treasury Inspector General 
        for Tax Administration on the Internal Revenue Service's 
        compliance with the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery 
        Act of 2010 highlights significant improper payments related to 
        the earned income tax credit under section 32 of the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986.
            (2) The Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 
        2010 defines an improper payment as ``any payment that should 
        not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount . . 
        . under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other 
        legally applicable requirements''.
            (3) The Internal Revenue Service estimates that 22 percent 
        to 26 percent of earned income tax credit payments were issued 
        improperly in fiscal year 2013, with the dollar value of these 
        improper payments estimated to be between $13.3 billion and 
        $15.6 billion.
            (4) The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration 
        has concluded that the Internal Revenue Service has made little 
        improvement in reducing improper earned income tax credit 
        payments since being required to report estimates of these 
        payments to Congress, and as a result, the earned income tax 
        credit program remains at high risk for improper payments.
            (5) The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that for tax 
        year 2014 there will be 28.5 million filers that will receive 
        the earned income tax credit.
            (6) Billions of dollars of improper payments will continue 
        to made unless reforms and improvements take place with respect 
        to the earned income tax credit and its administration by the 
        Internal Revenue Service.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Any budgetary savings resulting from the 
reforms and improvements enacted by this Act with respect to the earned 
income tax credit should be dedicated to expanding the credit for 
working families eligible for the earned income tax credit.

              CLAIM EITC BASED ON RECKLESS OR INTENTIONAL DISREGARD OF 
              THE RULES.

to taxable years ending after the date of the enactment of this Act.

    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to claims filed after the date of the enactment of this Act.
