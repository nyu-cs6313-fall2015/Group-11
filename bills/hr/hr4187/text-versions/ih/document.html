        section 505E(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
        U.S.C. 355f(f))) for which there is an unmet medical need and 
        which is associated with high rates of mortality or significant

        and Prevention (or, in the case that such Module is not 
        available, is used in facilities that participate in such 
        successor or similar reporting module or program relating to 
        antimicrobials as the Secretary shall specify to the extent 
        available to such facilities, as determined by the Secretary).

        beginning with fiscal year 2015, the Secretary shall further 
        reduce each of the average standardized amounts in an amount 
        equal to the amount of the net additional expenditures, if any,

        Institutes of Health, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and 
        the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
        conduct a study to--
                    (A) identify and examine the barriers that prevent 
                the development of new antimicrobial drugs, as defined 
                in section 1886(d)(5)(M)(iii) of the Social Security 
                Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)(M)(iii)); and
                    (B) develop recommendations for actions to be taken 
                in order to overcome any barriers identified under 
                subparagraph (A).
            (2) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to 
        Congress a report on the study conducted under paragraph (1).
