a result of the implementation of the provisions of, and amendments 
made by, this Act.
    (b) Strengthening Standards Applicable if Savings Not Achieved.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), if the Chief 
        Actuary projects under subsection (a) that the implementation 
        of the provisions of, and amendments made by, this Act will not 
        result in a cumulative reduction in spending under such part of 
        at least $250,000,000 for the period of years 2014 through 2018 
        (using a 2013 baseline), the Secretary shall, in accordance

        regulation (to take effect for 2015 and subsequent years) with 
        a period for public comment on such regulation after the date 
        of publication to strengthen the licensure, accreditation, and

        paragraph (1) shall not apply to a qualified physical therapist
