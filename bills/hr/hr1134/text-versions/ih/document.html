                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a grant 
 program and pilot program designed to improve the delivery of health 
   care to veterans residing in rural areas, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The estimated veteran population of the Nation is 
        22,328,000.
            (2) Nearly 30 percent of veterans live in rural areas, with 
        younger veterans who served in support of Operation Iraqi 
        Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom more likely than other 
        veterans to live in rural areas.
            (3) Veterans living in rural areas are reported to be in 
        poorer health than veterans living in urban areas.
            (4) Veterans living in rural areas often need to travel 
        extremely long distances to receive medical care and the other 
        services to which they are entitled.
            (5) The medical facilities of the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs include 821 community-based outpatient clinics, 300 
        veterans centers, and 152 hospitals.
            (6) Rural veterans represent 41 percent of the total number 
        of veterans enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        patient enrollment system under section 1705 of title 38, 
        United States Code.
            (7) A higher percentage of veterans residing in rural areas 
        reported having at least one disability compared with veterans 
        residing in urban areas.
            (8) Each year more than 150,000 members of the Armed Forces 
        are discharged or separated from service in the Armed Forces 
        and transition to veteran status.
            (9) Navigating the transition from the health care system 
        of Department of Defense to the health care system of the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs involves the coordination of 
        data and information between Department of Defense and the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs.
            (10) It is important to develop electronic health records 
        that can be accessed by both the Department of Defense and the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs whether a patient is a member of 
        the Armed Forces or a veteran to ensure the greater 
        availability of health care information for members of the 
        Armed Forces and veterans.
