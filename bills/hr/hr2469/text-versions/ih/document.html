To direct the Mayor of the District of Columbia to establish a District 
of Columbia National Guard Educational Assistance Program to encourage 
  the enlistment and retention of persons in the District of Columbia 
 National Guard by providing financial assistance to enable members of 
the National Guard of the District of Columbia to attend undergraduate,

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
              PROGRAM.

    The Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the organization of the 
militia of the District of Columbia'', approved March 1, 1889 (sec. 
49--101 et seq., D.C. Official Code) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new title:

               ``TITLE II--EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

``SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    ``(a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the `Major General 
David F. Wherley, Jr. District of Columbia National Guard Retention and 
College Access Act'.
    ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            ``(1) The District of Columbia National Guard is under the 
        exclusive jurisdiction of the President of the United States as 
        Commander-in-Chief and, unlike other National Guards, is 
        permanently federalized.
            ``(2) The District of Columbia National Guard is unique and 
        differs from the National Guards of the several States in that 
        the District of Columbia National Guard is responsible, not 
        only for residents of the District of Columbia, but also for a 
        special and unique mission and obligation as a result of the 
        extensive presence of the Federal Government in the District of 
        Columbia.
            ``(3) Consequently, the President of the United States, 
        rather than the chief executive of the District of Columbia, is 
        in command of the District of Columbia National Guard, and only 
        the President can call up the District of Columbia National 
        Guard even for local emergencies.
            ``(4) The District of Columbia National Guard has been 
        specifically trained to address the unique emergencies that may 
        occur regarding the presence of the Federal Government in the 
        District of Columbia.
            ``(5) The great majority of the members of the District of 
        Columbia National Guard actually live in Maryland or Virginia, 
        rather than in the District of Columbia.
            ``(6) The District of Columbia National Guard has been 
        experiencing a disproportionate decline in force in comparison 
        to the National Guards of Maryland and Virginia.
            ``(7) The States of Maryland and Virginia provide 
        additional recruiting and retention incentives, such as 
        educational benefits, in order to maintain their force, and 
        their National Guards have drawn recruits from the District of 
        Columbia at a rate that puts at risk the maintenance of the 
        necessary force levels for the District of Columbia National 
        Guard.
            ``(8) Funds for an educational benefit for members of the 
        District of Columbia National Guard would provide an incentive 
        to help reverse the loss of members to nearby National Guards 
        and allow for maintenance and increase of necessary District of 
        Columbia National Guard personnel.
            ``(9) The loss of members of the District of Columbia 
        National Guard could adversely affect the readiness of the 
        District of Columbia National Guard to respond in the event of 
        a terrorist attack on the capital of the United States.

``SEC. 202. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
              PROGRAM.
