of law, no funds shall be made available under any applicable program 
to any State educational agency or local educational agency that enters 
into a contract or other agreement with a school-based health center 
relating to the provision of health services to students served by the 
agency unless such center certifies that--
            ``(1) the center will not perform an abortion; and
