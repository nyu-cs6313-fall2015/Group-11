        paragraph (1).
    (b) Release of Amounts at End of the Congress.--In order to ensure

Members of that House of Congress any amounts remaining in any escrow 
account under this section on the last day of the One Hundred

        Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, or an 
        employee of the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer who 
        is designated by the Chief Administrative Officer to carry out 
        this section; and

serving in a position under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of section
