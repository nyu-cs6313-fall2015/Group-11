            (1) be for a term of not less than 10 years; and
            (2) expressly provide that--
                    (A) the districts may use any water impounded and 
                stored in the New Melones Reservoir for any legal 
                purpose under California law, including use within the 
                boundaries of either district, transfer to and 
                reasonable and beneficial use by a person or entity not

                    (B) any water impounded and stored by either 
                district shall not be released or withdrawn if the

the Bureau of Reclamation and the districts.
