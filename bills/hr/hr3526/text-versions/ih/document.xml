Moreover, in Somalia, the hardest hit country in the region, the terrorist group al-Shabaab obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance and directly threatened aid agencies. Thus, the famine was a foreseeable and, with unimpeded delivery of aid, a preventable event.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H094E995F495C4861945BC24341D18E7F"><enum>(2)</enum><text>It is estimated that 4 million Somalis were affected by the drought and famine in the region and several million remain vulnerable to this day. According to the May 2013 report issued by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the Famine Early Warning System Network, the Somalia famine resulted in 258,000 deaths between October 2010 and April 2012. More than half of those deaths were children under the age of five.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H3826C03B5FA341B4BBEF2A3D6A1DDBD2"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Because of laws prohibiting activities that may directly or indirectly support terrorist organizations, a general or specific license issued by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is needed to enable United States humanitarian organizations to legally provide assistance in al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia particularly with respect to activities that require interactions or dealings with al-Shabaab.</text></paragraph><paragraph commented="no" id="H2770FA02488941B58CFF9C321A3DB138"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has an OFAC-specific license to operate in these conditions in Somalia that covers the organizations that USAID funds, but not organizations that operate with their own funding or funding solely from non-United States Government sources, and also not the non-United States Government funding of organizations that operate with both United States Government and non-United States Government funding, unless USAID authorizes both types of funding to be covered under such OFAC-specific license. Organizations that operate in al-Shabaab-controlled areas without such a license can be subject to prosecution for violating United States law, at least with respect to activities or transactions that involve al-Shabaab, even incidentally.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H29A747996A8E4E0EA9B5B1975648F083"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Prior to OFAC issuing USAID its license, no licenses for humanitarian assistance to the people of Somalia were issued before the United Nations declared a famine in al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H4E86449773E84CD483E87136A05B1E80"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In pursuit of eliminating aid in any form to terrorist organizations, Executive orders have had the effect of undoing protections for humanitarian operations in areas controlled by such organizations previously contained in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C.1701 et seq.) and sections <external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/18/2339A">2339A</external-xref> and <external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/18/2339">2339B</external-xref> of title 18, United States Code (commonly known as the ‘‘Material Support Statutes’’). Furthermore, the prohibitions contained in such Executive orders and the Material Support Statutes discouraged and, in some instances, prohibited donors from contributing to aid efforts for all of Somalia. In some cases, the unintended consequences included preventing humanitarian organizations from establishing access to civilians and providing them with life-saving aid, while empowering terrorist organizations that became the sole conduit of aid.</text></paragraph></section><section id="HF3A9C262A9CB4B618F0161E2B3D3B56D"><enum>3.</enum><header>Sense of Congress</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">It is the sense of Congress that humanitarian organizations, acting in good faith and with the appropriate restrictions and controls in place, should not be prevented, directly or indirectly by Executive orders or counterterrorism laws, from accessing and providing aid to civilian populations before or early on in humanitarian crises, such as in the famine in al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia.</text></section><section id="H326430C9E60F4734979704D3345371F8"><enum>4.</enum><header>Amendments to section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act</header><subsection id="HE561BE5953FC4CA4B631DB02145BD348"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Additional exception</header><paragraph id="H61654719AD604024B981A6386454EDA8"><enum>(1)</enum><header>In general</header><text>Section 203 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/50/1702">50 U.S.C. 1702</external-xref>) is amended—</text><subparagraph id="H5B953E20B5654A419B28930F48DC88C1"><enum>(A)</enum><text>in subsection (b)(2)—</text><clause commented="no" id="H22CBB50142E645279E7DF10C19E2A997"><enum>(i)</enum><text>by inserting after <quote>to relieve human suffering</quote> the following: <quote>including donations to foreign persons subject to sanctions under this Act in order to achieve such purposes,</quote>;
