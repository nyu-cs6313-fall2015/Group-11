  <summary>11/18/2013--Introduced.
Humanitarian Assistance Facilitation Act of 2013 - Expresses the sense of Congress that humanitarian organizations acting in good faith and with the appropriate restrictions and controls in place should not be prevented from providing aid to civilian populations before or early on in humanitarian crises, such as in the famine in al-Shabaab-controlled areas of Somalia.

Amends the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to permit under specified conditions persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction to enter into transactions with certain sanctioned foreign persons that are customary, necessary, and incidental to the donation or provision of goods or services to prevent or alleviate the suffering of civilian populations.

Directs the Secretary of State to establish an Advisory Council on United States Policy Related to Non-Governmental Activities to Prevent and Respond to Human Suffering in Areas Affected By Certain Sanctioned Foreign Persons.

Amends the federal criminal code to exclude from the definition of "material support or resources" (regarding foreign terrorist organizations) engaging in speech or communication with a terrorist organization to prevent or alleviate the suffering of a civilian population, including speech or communication to reduce or eliminate the frequency and severity of violent conflict and reducing its impact on the civilian population.</summary>
