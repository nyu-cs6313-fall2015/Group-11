  <summary>7/16/2014--Introduced.
Country-of-Origin Labeling for Fuels Act - Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to study and make recommendations to Congress on appropriate methods and standards for requiring: (1) motor vehicle fuel suppliers to disclose to the next person in the motor vehicle fuel supply chain information regarding each country in which the fuel or any of its components were extracted, refined, or otherwise processed; and (2) motor vehicle fuel retailers to disclose this information to consumers.

Requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations requiring disclosure of country-of-origin information by motor vehicle fuel suppliers and retailers in accordance with such recommendations. Prohibits such regulations, however, from requiring the listing of more than one country-of-origin for a fuel blend containing fuel 70% or more of which originated in a single country.

Authorizes the Secretary to impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 on any person that knowingly violates such regulations.</summary>
