  To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide access to 
  certified professional midwives for women enrolled in the Medicaid 
                                program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Certified Professional 
Midwives Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR COVERAGE OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY CERTIFIED 
              PROFESSIONAL MIDWIVES UNDER MEDICAID.

    (a) Coverage of Certified Professional Midwife Services.--Section 
1905(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(a)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (28), by deleting ``and'' at the end;
            (2) by redesignating paragraph (29) as paragraph (30); and
            (3) by inserting after paragraph (28) the following 
        paragraph:
            ``(29) services that--
                    ``(A) are furnished by a certified professional 
                midwife (as defined by the Secretary); and
                    ``(B) the certified professional midwife is legally 
                authorized to perform under State law (or the State 
                regulatory mechanism provided by State law); and''.
    (b) Inclusion in Mandatory Services.--Section 1902(a)(10)(A) of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A)) is amended, in the 
matter before clause (i)--
            (1) by striking ``and'' before ``(28)''; and
            (2) by inserting ``, and (29)'' after ``(28)''.
    (c) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        amendments made by this section shall take effect on January 1, 
        2015.
            (2) Rule for changes requiring state legislation.--In the 
        case of a State plan for medical assistance under title XIX of 
        the Social Security Act which the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services determines requires State legislation (other than 
        legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet 
        the additional requirements imposed by the amendments made by 
        this section, the State plan shall not be regarded as failing 
        to comply with the requirements of such title solely on the 
        basis of its failure to meet these additional requirements 
        before the later of the following dates:
                    (A) The first day of the first calendar quarter 
                beginning after the close of the first regular session 
                of the State legislature that begins after the date of 
                the enactment of this Act.
                    (B) The date in paragraph (1).
        For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State 
        that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such 
        session shall be deemed to be a separate regular session of the 
        State legislature.
                                 <all>
