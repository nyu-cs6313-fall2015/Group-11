(or, in any circumstance described in section 2(b), after the earliest 
date, on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, as of which a

amended, is in operation) the Government Accountability Office shall 
submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on--
            (1) the operation of such system; and
