                    (A) In general.--The term ``study area'' means the 
                portion of the Hudson River that flows from Rodgers

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Hudson River Valley possesses nationally 
        significant and unique cultural, historical, natural, 
        recreational, and scenic resources;
            (2) the Hudson River Valley is home to a robust and growing 
        tourism and recreation industry that is an important component 
        of the regional economy;
            (3) throughout history, the Hudson River Valley has played 
        a crucial role in the development of the United States, 
        starting from the vibrant Native American communities that 
        first inhabited the land, to the voyage of Henry Hudson up the 
        river later named for Hudson in the vessel Half Moon in 1609 
        and later with the American Revolution, the debate on our 
        Constitution, the first successful steamboat voyage by Robert 
        Fulton in 1807, the Industrial Revolution, the establishment of 
        the Erie Canal and growth of metropolitan New York, and the 
        inception of the modern labor and environmental movements;
            (4) the Hudson River Valley gave birth to important 
        movements in the art, architecture, and literature of the 
        United States;
            (5) the Hudson River Valley encompasses a rich array of 
        sensitive natural resources ranging from the Hudson River and 
        the vast estuarine district of the Hudson River, to the 
        wetlands, refuges, parks, forests, farmlands, preserves, 
        cliffs, valleys, and wildlife of the Hudson River;
            (6) the depictions and descriptions of the renowned scenery 
        and natural resources of the Hudson River Valley played a 
        central role in the recognition of the value of the landscape 
        and the development of the esthetic and environmental ideal of 
        the United States;
            (7) a 1996 National Park Service study described the Hudson 
        River Valley as ``the landscape that defined America''; and
            (8) the Hudson River Valley has been the subject of 
        multiple State and Federal inventories, studies, and plans that 
        should greatly assist in the conduct of a National Park Service 
        special resource study.

        other landscape protection models, that--
                    (A) encompass large areas of non-Federal land 
                within designated boundaries;
                    (B) promote increased heritage tourism and economic 
                development;
