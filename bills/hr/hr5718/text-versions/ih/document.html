                                 A BILL


 
   To study the effect of the Earth's magnetic field on the weather.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stockman Effect Act''.

SEC. 2. MAGNETIC FIELD STUDY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Prior to a magnetic polar shift, there is a decline in 
        the Earth's magnetic fields.
            (2) Decrease in magnetic fields could impact global 
        temperatures.
            (3) There is a possibility that the reason Mars lost its 
        atmosphere was because of the loss of its magnetic field.
    (b) Magnetic Field Study.--The director of the National Science 
Foundation shall commission a study on the impact that a shift in the 
Earth's magnetic field could have on the weather.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
