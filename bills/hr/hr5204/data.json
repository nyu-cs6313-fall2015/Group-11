Prohibits the Secretary from charging recreation fees for any site, area, or activity except as authorized by statute.\n\nRequires the Secretary to determine a nationally consistent fee policy and rate structure for specified fees authorized by this Act.\n\nEstablishes a stewardship program for recreation service providers involving credit against permit fees in exchange for maintenance and resource protection work performed.\n\nRequires congressional approval of certain new or increased fees.\n\nIncreases the portion of fee revenue available for expenditure at the collection site from 80% to 90%. Limits fee revenues that the Secretary may use for overhead, administrative, and collection costs."
