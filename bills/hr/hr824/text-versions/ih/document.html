SEC. 3. WORKFORCE LIMITS AND REDUCTIONS.

    (a) In General.--The President, through the Office of Management

to each quarter beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the total number of Federal employees determined for such quarter does

    (b) Applicable Maximum.--For purposes of this Act, the ``applicable 
maximum'' for a quarter is--
            (1) in the case of a quarter before the target-attainment 
        quarter, the number equal to--
                    (A) the total number of Federal employees 
                determined for the baseline quarter, reduced by
                    (B) \2/3\ of the number of Federal employees 
                separating from agencies during the period--
                            (i) beginning on the first day following

            (2) in the case of the target-attainment quarter and any 
        subsequent quarter, the number equal to 90 percent of the total 
        number of Federal employees as of September 30, 2012.
    (c) Target-Attainment Quarter.--For purposes of this Act, the term 
``target-attainment quarter'' means the earlier of--
            (1) the first quarter (subsequent to the baseline quarter) 
        for which the total number of Federal employees does not exceed 
        90 percent of the total number of Federal employees as of 
        September 30, 2012; or
            (2) the quarter ending on September 30, 2015.

            (2) Exception.--If, for any quarter, the total number of 
        Federal employees exceeds the applicable maximum for such 
        quarter, then, until the first succeeding quarter for which 
        such total number is determined not to exceed the applicable 
        maximum for such succeeding quarter, reductions shall be made 
        through both attrition and a freeze on appointments.
    (e) Counting Rules.--For purposes of this Act--
            (1) any determination of the total number of Federal 
        employees or the number of Federal employees separating from

                    (B) under section 4; and
            (2) any determination of the total number of Federal 
        employees for a quarter shall be made as of such date or 
        otherwise on such basis as the Office of Management of Budget 
        (in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management) 
        considers to be representative and feasible.
    (f) Waiver Authority.--The President may waive any of the preceding 
provisions of this section, with respect to an individual appointment,

which a cost comparison demonstrates that such contracts would be to 
the financial advantage of the Government.

Office of Personnel Management) shall--
            (1) continuously monitor all agencies and, for each quarter
