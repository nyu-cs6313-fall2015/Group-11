This principle is underscored in the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization which called for <quote>entering into reciprocal and mutually advantageous arrangements directed to the substantial reduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade and to the elimination of discriminatory treatment in international trade relations</quote>.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HEFA058CF9E31493B89B8465F350145BF"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The American people have a right to expect that the promises that trade negotiators and policy makers offer in terms of the market access opportunities that will be available to United States businesses and their employees if trade agreements are reached, will, in fact, be realized. A results-oriented approach must form the basis of future trade negotiations that includes verification procedures to ensure that the promised market access is achieved and that reciprocal trade benefits result.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC4C68242EF0549659954959C1380646D"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">With each subsequent round of bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade negotiations, tariffs have been significantly reduced or eliminated for many manufactured goods, leaving nontariff barriers as the most pervasive, significant, and challenging barriers to United States exports and market opportunities.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H0B3A63ED62FE4A7692190D1AA0365621"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The United States market is widely recognized as one of the most open markets in the world.

As a result, a tariff can be reduced or eliminated without securing elimination of the real barrier or barriers that deny United States businesses access to a foreign market.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="H28EA1BCC16CD491E87F9CBA2C845F88F"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Purpose</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The purpose of this Act is to require that United States trade negotiations achieve measurable results for United States businesses by ensuring that trade agreements result in expanded market access for United States exports and not solely the elimination of tariffs on goods imported into the United States.</text></subsection></section><section id="H0128F610ED55419EABB3CC219D10D97A"><enum>3.</enum><header>Limitation on authority to reduce or eliminate rates of duty pursuant to certain trade agreements</header><subsection id="H3A03B71E79D445BD987A446B94D7CAE0"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Limitation</header><text>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President may not agree to a modification of an existing duty that would reduce or eliminate the bound or applied rate of such duty on any product in order to carry out a trade agreement entered into between the United States and a foreign country until the President transmits to Congress a certification described in subsection (b).</text></subsection><subsection id="H757E706AB98747F9BA970B46FBC6A9AF"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Certification</header><text>A certification referred to in subsection (a) is a certification by the President that—</text><paragraph id="HBFCB3C3818774260AD22F952098CF57D"><enum>(1)</enum><text>the United States has obtained the reduction or elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and practices of the government of a foreign country described in subsection (a) with respect to United States exports of any product identified by United States domestic producers as having the same physical characteristics and uses as the product for which a modification of an existing duty is sought by the President as described in subsection (a);
