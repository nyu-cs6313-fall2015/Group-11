                                 A BILL


 
            To terminate the Election Assistance Commission.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Election 
Assistance Commission Termination Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) authorized 
        annual appropriations of not more than $10,000,000 for the 
        Election Assistance Commission (EAC) for fiscal years 2003, 
        2004, and 2005. Funding for additional years has not been 
        authorized, and in fiscal year 2011 the EAC's budget grew to 
        nearly $18,000,000.
            (2) Between 2007 and 2011, the number of staff at the EAC 
        grew from 26 to 48 without an increase in statutory 
        responsibility.
            (3) 55 percent of the EAC's fiscal year 2014 budget request 
        is devoted to management costs, the third consecutive year for 
        which management costs have exceeded one-half of the EAC's 
        budget.
            (4) The EAC has distributed more than $3.2 billion in 
        election reform grants to the States. The most recent year for 
        which appropriations for these grants were enacted or were 
        requested in the President's annual budget was fiscal year 
        2010.
            (5) The EAC last issued voluntary voting system guidelines 
        in 2005. A total of 11 voting systems currently hold a 
        certification from the EAC.
            (6) The research division of the EAC has substantially 
        completed the reports required by HAVA.
            (7) The National Association of Secretaries of State 
        adopted resolutions calling for the dissolution of the EAC in 
        2005 and 2010.
            (8) The EAC has not had a quorum of commissioners since 
        December 2010, and has not had any commissioners since December 
        2011. The EAC has not had an Executive Director since December 
        2011, and has not had a General Counsel since May 2012.
            (9) The existence of the EAC is not necessary to the 
        conduct of Federal elections and is an unnecessary expenditure 
        of taxpayer funds. Any functions of the EAC worth continuing 
        can be performed by other government entities, consortia of 
        government entities, or private associations.

SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF ELECTION ASSISTANCE COMMISSION.
