  To establish a grant program to empower relatives, friends, and co-
      workers of domestic violence victims to create safety plans.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Violence Safety Plan Grant 
Program Act of 2014'' or as the ``My Sister's Keeper Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Approximately 1 in 4 women will experience domestic 
        violence during her lifetime and every year, 1 in 3 women who 
        is a victim of homicide is murdered by her current or former 
        partner.
            (2) Every year, more than 3 million children witness 
        domestic violence in their homes and children who live in homes 
        where there is domestic violence also suffer abuse or neglect 
        at high rates.
            (3) Children are more likely to intervene when they witness 
        severe violence against a parent, which places them at great 
        risk for injury or even death.
            (4) Girls who witness domestic violence are more vulnerable 
        to abuse as teens and adults and boys who witness domestic 
        violence are more likely to become adult abusers of their 
        partners, their children, or both, thus continuing the cycle of 
        violence in the next generation.
            (5) Most domestic violence incidents are never reported.
            (6) Family members, close friends, co-workers, and other 
        persons close to a victim of domestic violence frequently 
        observe things that lead to them to suspect that their loved 
        one or colleague is being abused but do not feel they possess 
        the knowledge and skills needed to provide constructive 
        assistance that can make a real difference in the life of the 
        victim.
            (7) Domestic violence costs the national economy more than 
        $37 billion a year in law enforcement involvement, legal work, 
        medical and mental health treatment, and lost productivity.
