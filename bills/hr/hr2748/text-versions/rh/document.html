            ``(4) the term `centralized delivery' means a primary mode

the most cost-effective primary mode of mail delivery feasible for 
postal patrons.
    ``(c) Phaseout of Door Delivery.--

        Service shall implement a program, wherever feasible, to 
        provide a primary mode of mail delivery other than door 
        delivery to new addresses established after the date of 
        enactment of this section.
            ``(2) Business address conversion.--Subject to paragraph 
        (4), the Postal Service shall implement a program to convert 
        existing business addresses with door delivery to centralized 
        delivery to the maximum extent feasible. In cases in which 
        conversion to centralized delivery is impractical, conversion 
        to curbside delivery shall be implemented to the maximum extent 
        feasible.
            ``(3) Residential address conversion.--
                    ``(A) Identification.--Within one year after the 
                date of enactment of this section, each district office 
                shall identify residential addresses within its service 
                area that are appropriate candidates for conversion 
                from door delivery to curbside or centralized delivery, 
                in accordance with standards established by the Postal 
                Service.

                effective primary modes of mail delivery.
                    ``(C) Procedures.--In carrying out conversions 
                under subparagraph (B), the Postal Service shall 
                establish procedures to--
                            ``(i) solicit, consider, and respond to 
                        input from postal patrons, State and local 
                        governments, local associations, and property 
                        owners; and
                            ``(ii) place centralized delivery points in 
                        locations that maximize delivery efficiency, 
                        ease of use for postal patrons, and respect for 
                        private property rights.
            ``(4) Considerations.--In making any determination to 
        convert the primary mode of mail delivery for an existing 
        address from door delivery to any other primary mode of mail 
        delivery, or to provide a primary mode of mail delivery to a 
        new address, the Postal Service may shall consider--
                    ``(A) the impact of weather conditions, physical 
                barriers, or any other factor that may impact the 
                feasibility of providing a primary mode of mail 
                delivery other than door delivery (such as a factor 
                that may significantly reduce the potential cost 
                savings associated with providing centralized or 
                curbside delivery);
                    ``(B) whether the address is in a registered 
                historic district (as that term is defined in section 
                47(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) is 
                listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is 
                designated as a National Historic Landmark, or is of 
                historic value; and
                    ``(C) population density and the concentration of 
                poverty.
            ``(5) Waiver for physical hardship.--The Postal Service 
        shall establish and maintain a waiver program under which, upon 
        application, door delivery may be continued, or provided, at no 
        cost to the applicant in any case in which--
                    ``(A) centralized or curbside delivery would, but 
                for this paragraph, otherwise be the primary mode of 
                mail delivery; and
                    ``(B) door delivery is necessary in order to avoid 
                causing significant physical hardship or physical 
                safety risks  to a postal patron.
            ``(6) Legacy door delivery service.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Postal Service may continue 
                to provide, for a fee to be paid by the addressee, door 
                delivery to an address that received door delivery as 
                of January 1, 2013, but was converted to a different 
                primary mode of mail delivery as a result of the 
                requirements of subsection (d).
                    ``(B) Offset.--The fee shall, when taken in the 
                nationwide aggregate, offset the additional cost to the 
                Postal Service for door delivery (compared to the cost 
                of the primary mode of mail delivery which would 
                otherwise exist for such address) as a result of the 
                requirements of subsection (d).
                    ``(C) Requirements.--The fee shall be subject to 
                the requirements of section 3622(d)(1)(B) and the 
                Postmaster General may by regulation prescribe the 
                method of the fee's calculation.
    ``(d) Modernization Requirement.--
            ``(1) Minimum points to be converted.--Not later than 
        September 30, 2022, the Postal Service shall convert not less 
        than 30,000,000 of the door delivery points extant on December 
        31, 2012, to centralized or curbside delivery.
            ``(2) Conversion order.--In determining which delivery 
        points to convert under paragraph (1), postal patrons who 
        voluntarily agree to convert their delivery point or points 
        under subsection (c)(3) shall take precedence over any other 
        conversions to the greatest extent practicable.
            ``(3) Procedures.--In carrying out conversions under 
        paragraph (1), the Postal Service shall establish procedures 
        to--
                    ``(A) solicit, consider, and respond to input from 
                the general public, postal patrons, State and local 
                governments, local associations, and property owners 
                which shall include but not be limited to a minimum of 
                a public community meeting prior to the commencement of 
                the conversion of a community, prior to the completion 
                of the conversion of a community and at any point in 
                the process when the District Manager makes a change to 
                the delivery method or the location of centralized 
                delivery points;

                cost or savings of the conversion to the Postal Service 
                as well as the average conversion cost or savings to 
                each postal patron and any cost or savings to the State 
                and local government; and
                    ``(C) place centralized delivery points in 
                locations that maximize delivery efficiency, ease of 
                use for postal patrons, and respect for private 
                property rights.
            ``(3)(4) Funding and repayment.--Until September 30, 2022, 
        the Postal Service may withdraw funds from the Postal Service 
        Delivery-Point Modernization Fund to carry out the purposes of 
        this section. All savings accrued by the Postal Service from 
        conversions under this subsection shall be repaid to the Fund 
        on a monthly basis until all funds have been repaid. All funds 
        withdrawn under this paragraph must be repaid not later than 
        September 30, 2023.
            ``(4)(5) Voucher program.--The Postal Service shall, in

        Service shall by regulation prescribe, provide for a voucher 
        program, funded through the Postal Service Delivery Point 
        Modernization Fund, under which, upon application, the Postal 
        Service may defray all or any portion of the costs associated 
        with conversion from door delivery under this section which 
        would otherwise be borne by postal patrons.
            ``(5)(6) Treatment of exemption.--Addresses receiving door 
        delivery or legacy door delivery as a result of paragraph (5)

                year during a control period, budgeted expenditures of 
                the Postal Service for the fiscal year involved may not 
                exceed budgeted revenues of the Postal Service for the 
                fiscal year involved.
                    (B) In each fiscal year where a financial plan and 
                budget must be developed, the financial plan and budget 
                shall provide for continuous, substantial progress 
                toward long-term fiscal solvency of the Postal Service.
                    (C) The financial plan and budget shall provide for

                continuing long-term solvency of the Postal Service, as 
                indicated by factors such as the efficient management 
                of the Postal Service's workforce and the effective 
                provision of services by the Postal Service. In so 
                doing, the financial plan and budget shall consider--
                            (i) the legal authority of the Postal 
                        Service;

                        this Act;
                            (iii) any cost savings that the Postal 
                        Service anticipates will be achieved through 
                        negotiations with employees of the Postal 
                        Service;
                            (iv) projected changes in mail volume;

                        Service was required by law to promulgate;
                            (vi) projected changes in the number of 
                        employees needed to carry out the 
                        responsibilities of the Postal Service; and
                            (vii) the long-term capital needs of the 
                        Postal Service, including the need to maintain, 
                        repair, and replace facilities and equipment.
            (2) Application of sound budgetary practices.--In meeting

        shall apply sound budgetary practices, including reducing costs 
        and other expenditures, improving productivity, increasing 
        revenues, or a combination of such practices.
            (3) Assumptions based on current law.--In meeting the 
        requirements described in paragraph (1) with respect to a 
        financial plan and budget for a fiscal year, the Postal Service 
        shall base estimates of revenues and expenditures on Federal 
        law  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Federal law 
        (including regulations) as in effect at the time of the 
        preparation of such financial plan and budget.
    (d) Definition.--For the purposes of this section, the term ``long-
term solvency'' means the ability of the Postal Service over the long 
term to pay debts and meet expenses, including the ability to perform

                of an initial Governor expiring as described in 
                subparagraph (A)(ii)).

                        protect the Postal Service from being placed at 
                        a competitive disadvantage relative to a
