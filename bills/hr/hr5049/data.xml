Blackfoot River Land Exchange Act of 2014 - (Sec. 4) Extinguishes all claims and all right, title, and interest in specified Indian and non-Indian land as part of the settlement of disputes within the Fort Hall Indian Reservation of the Shoshone-Bannock Indian Tribes in Idaho resulting from the realignment of the Blackfoot River by the Corps of Engineers in 1964.

(Sec. 5) Requires the non-Indian land to be held in trust by the United States for the Tribes.

(Sec. 6) Directs the Secretary of the Interior to transfer the Indian land to the Blackfoot River Flood Control District No. 7 for use or sale. Requires any proceeds from the sale of the land to be used to compensate: (1) each non-Indian landowner at fair market value for his or her loss of land resulting from this Act's implementation, and (2) the Blackfoot River Flood Control District No. 7 for any expenses it incurs in carrying out this Act.

Authorizes the Blackfoot River Flood Control District No. 7 to dispose of the land or proceeds that remain in any manner it determines to be appropriate.</summary>
