                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 38, United States Code, to eliminate the time limitation 
for use of eligibility and entitlement to educational assistance under 
 certain programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Education Flexibility 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following::
            (1) According to the ``National Survey of Veterans, Active 
        Duty Service Members, Demobilized National Guard and Reserve 
        Members, Family Members, and Surviving Spouses Final Report'', 
        commissioned by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in 2010, 20.6 
        percent of eligible veterans--approximately 2,621,753 
        veterans--were unable to use their GI bill educational benefits 
        because their period of eligibility expired.
            (2) The time limitations for using GI bill educational 
        benefits do not reflect the realities of the modern economy of 
        the United States. After leaving the service, many veterans 
        postpone further education to join the workforce and support 
        their families or are faced with lengthy rehabilitations from 
        service-related injuries.
            (3) Access to education and job retraining has proved the 
        arbiter of success in today's economy, and if the United States 
        is to lower the unemployment rate among the veteran population, 
        the United States must provide veterans unfettered access to 
        educational benefits.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to remove the delimiting 
dates and retroactively restore the Department of Veterans Affairs 
Educational benefits within the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational 
Assistance Program (VEAP), Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD), 
and Post-9/11 GI Bill.

              ENTITLEMENT TO EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE.

              expiring during a quarter or semester or after a major 
              portion of a course is complete
    ``(a) Educational Institutions Operating on Quarter or Semester 
System.--If an individual eligible for educational assistance under 
this chapter is enrolled under this chapter in an educational 
institution regularly operated on the quarter or semester system and 
the period of such individual's entitlement under this chapter would, 
under section 3013, expire during a quarter or semester, such period 
shall be extended to the end of such quarter or semester.
    ``(b) Other Educational Institutions.--If an individual eligible 
for educational assistance under this chapter is enrolled under this 
chapter in an educational institution not regularly operated on the 
quarter or semester system and the period of such individual's 
entitlement under this chapter would, under section 3013, expire after
