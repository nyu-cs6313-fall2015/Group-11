    (a) In General.--Section 12406 of the Federal Ocean Acidification 
Research And Monitoring Act of 2009 (33 U.S.C. 3705) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' after the

            ``(4) includes an ongoing mechanism that allows affected 
        industry members, coastal stakeholders, non-federal resource 
        managers, and outside scientific experts to provide input on 
        research, data, and monitoring needs that are necessary to 
        support on-the-ground management, decisionmaking, and 
        adaptation related to ocean acidification and its impacts.'';
            (2) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c); and
            (3) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:
    ``(b) Community Vulnerability Assessment.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary, through the program 
        established under subsection (a), shall conduct an ocean

                ocean resources that may be impacted by ocean 
                acidification;
                    ``(B) assess the nature of those communities' 
                social and economic vulnerabilities;

                changes in ocean and coastal marine resources that are 
                not managed by the Federal Government;
                    ``(D) identify key knowledge gaps where research 
                could be devoted to better understand the possible 
                impacts of ocean acidification on these vulnerable 
                communities, the risks and threats facing these 
                communities, and possible adaptation strategies for 
                these communities; and

                from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
                Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service, and 
                Coastal Services Center.''.
    (b) Strategic Research Plan.--Section 12405(b) of the Federal Ocean

        of section 12406.''.
