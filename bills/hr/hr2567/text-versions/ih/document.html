 To require that all handguns manufactured, sold in, or imported into, 
  the United States incorporate technology that precludes the average 
  five year old child from operating the handgun when it is ready to 
                                 fire.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Child Handgun Safety Act''.

SEC. 2. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD FOR CHILD-RESISTANT HANDGUNS.

    (a) Establishment of Standard.--Notwithstanding section 3(a)(5)(E) 
of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a)(5)(E)), the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission, in consultation with the Attorney 
General and the Director of the National Institute of Justice, shall 
promulgate a consumer product safety standard under section 7(a) of 
such Act (15 U.S.C. 2056(a)) for handguns.
    (b) Standard Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--The standard established under subsection 
        (a) shall require that--
                    (A) effective 1 year after the date of the 
                enactment of this Act, any handgun manufactured in the 
                United States must be child-resistant and include a 
                mechanism such as one described in paragraph (2) that 
                effectively precludes an average five year old child 
                from operating the handgun when it is ready to fire; 
                and
                    (B) effective 2 years after the date of the 
                enactment of this Act, any handgun sold, offered for 
                sale, traded, transferred, shipped, leased, or 
                distributed in the United States must be--
                            (i) child-resistant, if manufactured on or 
                        after the effective date in subparagraph (A); 
                        or
                            (ii) a retrofitted child-resistant handgun, 
                        if manufactured before the effective date in 
                        paragraph (1).
            (2) Mechanisms described.--The mechanisms described in 
        paragraph (1)(A) include--
                    (A) raising trigger resistance to at least a ten-
                pound pull;
                    (B) altering the firing mechanism so that an 
                average five year old child's hands are too small to 
                operate the handgun; or
                    (C) requiring a series of multiple motions in order 
                to fire the handgun.
    (c) Exemptions.--
            (1) Antique firearms.--The standard established under this 
        section shall not require retrofitting of antique firearms.
            (2) Military firearms.--The standard established under this 
        section shall not apply to a firearm that is owned by the 
        Department of Defense.

        cost of retrofitting a handgun as required under subsection (b) 
        shall be borne by the manufacturer of the handgun if the 
        manufacturer is operational at the time the retrofit is 
        required.
            (2) Reimbursement.--Section 524(c) of title 28, United 
        States Code, is amended--
                    (A) in subparagraph (H), by striking ``; and'' and 
                inserting a semicolon;
                    (B) in subparagraph (I), by striking the period at 
                the end and inserting ``; and''; and
                    (C) by inserting after subparagraph (I) the 
                following:
            ``(J) payments to reimburse manufacturers of handguns for 
        the costs of retrofitting handguns as required by section
