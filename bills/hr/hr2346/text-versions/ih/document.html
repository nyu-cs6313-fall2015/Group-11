                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the National Labor Relations Act to ensure the right of 
 employees to a secret ballot election conducted by the National Labor 
                            Relations Board.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Secret Ballot Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the importance of a secret ballot election has been 
        recognized by the United States for over 100 years;
            (2) the fundamental democratic right to choose by secret 
        ballot is the only method that ensures a choice free of 
        coercion, intimidation, irregularity, or illegality;
            (3) the recognition of a labor organization by way of a 
        private agreement, rather than a secret ballot election 
        supervised by a neutral third party, threatens an employee's 
        right, codified in the National Labor Relations Act, to choose 
        whether or not to be represented by a labor organization; and
            (4) preserving workers' right to choose whether or not to 
        be represented by a labor organization through a secret ballot 
        election is important to the strength of the national economy.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT.

    (a) Recognition of Representative.--
            (1) In general.--Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor 
        Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 158(a)(2)) is amended by inserting 
        before the colon the following: ``or to recognize or bargain 
        collectively with a labor organization that has not been 
        selected by a majority of employees in a unit appropriate for 
        such purposes in a secret ballot election conducted by the 
        Board in accordance with section 9''.
            (2) Application.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall 
        not apply to collective bargaining relationships that were 
        recognized before the date of enactment of this Act.
    (b) Election Required.--
            (1) In general.--Section 8(b) of the National Labor 
        Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 158(b)), as amended by subsection (c) 
        of this section, is amended--

        organization that has not been selected by a majority of 
        employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes in a secret

        adding at the end the following:
            ``(2) The Board shall conduct a secret ballot election to 
        determine whether a labor organization certified or recognized 
        by an employer as the representative for the purposes of 
        collective bargaining is no longer the representative of a unit 
        as defined in paragraph (1).''.
            (3) Application.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall 
        not apply to collective bargaining relationships that were
