Authorizes the Bank to conduct its business without regard to state law relating to incorporation.\n\nExempts the Bank from all state or local taxation except real property taxation.\n\nRequires the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank to set forth spending safeguards, including: (1) deobligating financial support to entities that demonstrate an insufficient level of performance or wasteful or fraudulent spending, and (2) creating a publicly available online database with information about financing support or risk management.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to limit and defer tax deduction amounts for foreign-related interest expense (i.e., interest expense allocated and apportioned to income from sources outside the United States)."
