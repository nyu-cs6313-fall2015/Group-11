                                 A BILL


 
 To require that activities carried out by the United States in South 
   Sudan relating to governance, reconstruction and development, and 
 refugee relief and assistance will support the basic human rights of 
     women and women's participation and leadership in these areas.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Rights and Access for the 
Women of South Sudan Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Despite the 2011 referendum for secession that 
        established the independent state of South Sudan, South 
        Sudanese women continue to experience brutal violation of their 
        human rights.
            (2) Strong and continued United States support can ensure 
        that the advances made by South Sudanese women since July 2011 
        when the Republic of South Sudan gained its independence will 
        continue and grow, rather than recede.
            (3) The United States has made a substantial contribution 
        to the emergency relief and humanitarian efforts for South 
        Sudan. Completing the United States mission in South Sudan will 
        also require significant and long-term investments in 
        development and reconstruction assistance.
            (4) An inadequate healthcare system has resulted in high 
        maternal and infant mortality rates. The maternal mortality 
        rate is 1,054 deaths per 100,000 live births, making it one of 
        the highest in the world.
            (5) South Sudan faces many difficulties with its lack of 
        infrastructure and lacks significant human development factors, 
        which can further marginalize women.
            (6) Over 80 percent of women and girls in South Sudan are 
        illiterate, and thus it is imperative to both secure and inform 
        women's rights within the national development.
            (7) With the assistance of internal aid and the 
        proliferation of local women's organizations, women's equality 
        can be integrated into South Sudan's nation-building efforts.
            (8) South Sudan has made gains in incorporating women into 
        the new regime with efforts such as inclusion in the 
        legislative assembly, thus additional support from the United 
        States serves to reinforce these ideals and implementations.
            (9) The women of South Sudan are taking the initiative to 
        reach across the conflict divide and foster peace. Women's 
        perspectives and experiences in seeking solutions to conflicts 
        are necessary to ensure lasting peace.
            (10) Adequate security in both urban and rural areas, 
        particularly on military borders, is essential if women and 
        girls are to exercise their human rights, work, attend school, 
        and otherwise participate in and benefit from humanitarian and 
        development programs sponsored by the United States.
