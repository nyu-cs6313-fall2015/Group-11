                    (A) the right to life guaranteed by the

                paramount and most fundamental right of a person; and
                    (B) the life of each human being begins with 
                fertilization, cloning, or its functional equivalent, 
                irrespective of sex, health, function or disability, 
                defect, stage of biological development, or condition 
                of dependency, at which time every human being shall

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    For purposes of this Act:
            (1) Fertilization.--The term ``fertilization'' means the 
        process of a human spermatozoan penetrating the cell membrane 
        of a human oocyte to create a human zygote, a one-celled human 
        embryo, which is a new unique human being.
            (2) Cloning.--The term ``cloning'' means the process called 
        somatic cell nuclear transfer, that combines an enucleated egg 
        and the nucleus of a somatic cell to make a human embryo.
            (3) Human; human being.--The terms ``human'' and ``human 
        being'' include each and every member of the species homo 
        sapiens at all stages of life, beginning with the earliest 
        stage of development, created by the process of fertilization, 
        cloning, or its functional equivalent.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
