     To quitclaim surface rights to certain Federal land under the 
jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management in Virginia City, Nevada, 
 to Storey County, Nevada, to resolve conflicting ownership and title

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

            (1) The Federal Government owns real property in Storey 
        County in the State of Nevada.
            (2) While the real property described in paragraph (1) is 
        under the jurisdiction of the Secretary, some of the real 
        property has been occupied for decades by individuals--
                    (A) who took possession by purchase or other 
                documented and putatively legal transactions; and
                    (B) the continued occupation by whom constitutes a 
                trespass on the title held by the Federal Government.
            (3) As a result of the confused and conflicting ownership 
        claims, the real property described in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) is difficult to manage under multiple use 
                policies; and
                    (B) creates a continuing source of friction and 
                unease between the Federal Government and local 
                residents.
            (4) All of the real property described in paragraph (1) is 
        appropriate for disposal for the purpose of promoting 
        administrative efficiency and effectiveness.
