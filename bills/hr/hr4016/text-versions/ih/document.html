subsection are services provided for children who have not attained age 
21, and who, as a result of mental illness, other emotional or 
behavioral disorders, medically fragile conditions, or developmental 
disabilities, need the level of care provided in an institution 
(including a psychiatric residential treatment facility) or nursing 
facility the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan but 
who can be cared for or maintained in a community placement, through a 
qualified therapeutic foster care program described in paragraph (2).
    ``(2) A qualified therapeutic foster care program described in this 
paragraph is a program that--
            ``(A) is licensed by the State and accredited by the Joint 
        Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the

        intervention and crisis support services, medication 
        monitoring, counseling, and case management, and may furnish

        mental illness, trauma, other emotional or behavioral 
        disorders, medically fragile conditions, or developmental 
        disabilities, and specific additional training on the needs of 
        each child provided such services.
    ``(3) In making coverage determinations under paragraph (1), a 
State may employ medical necessity criteria that are similar to the
