To amend the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to specify that

    by certain nondepository covered persons with Federal and State 
             financial regulators, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

Privilege Parity Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. PRIVILEGE OF INFORMATION SHARED BY CERTAIN NONDEPOSITORY 
              COVERED PERSONS.

    Section 1024(b)(3) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 
(12 U.S.C. 5514(b)(3)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``regulators and the State bank regulatory 
        authorities'' and inserting ``regulators, the State bank 
        regulatory authorities, and the State agencies that licence, 
        supervise, or examine the offering of consumer financial 
        products or services''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following: ``The sharing of 
        information with such regulators, authorities, and agencies 
        shall not be construed as waiving, destroying, or otherwise 
        affecting any privilege or confidentiality such person may 
        claim with respect to such information under Federal or State 
        law as to any person or entity other than such Bureau, agency, 
        supervisor, or authority.''.

            Passed the House of Representatives July 29, 2014.

            Attest:
