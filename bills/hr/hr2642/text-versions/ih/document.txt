        revenue loss coverage with respect to the acreage added to the 
        farm under this subsection or a prorated payment under the 
        conservation reserve contract, but not both.
    (b) Prevention of Excess Base Acres.--
            (1) Required reduction.--If the sum of the base acres for a 
        farm, together with the acreage described in paragraph (2) 
        exceeds the actual cropland acreage of the farm, the Secretary 
        shall reduce the base acres for 1 or more covered commodities 
        or cotton for the farm so that the sum of the base acres and 
        acreage described in paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual 
        cropland acreage of the farm.
            (2) Other acreage.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
        Secretary shall include the following:
                    (A) Any acreage on the farm enrolled in the

                    (B) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a 
                Federal conservation program for which payments are 
                made in exchange for not producing an agricultural 
                commodity on the acreage.
                    (C) If the Secretary designates additional 
                oilseeds, any eligible oilseed acreage, which shall be 
                determined in the same manner as eligible oilseed 
                acreage under subsection (a)(1)(C).
            (3) Selection of acres.--The Secretary shall give the owner 
        of the farm the opportunity to select the base acres for a 
        covered commodity or cotton for the farm against which the 
        reduction required by paragraph (1) will be made.
            (4) Exception for double-cropped acreage.--In applying 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make an exception in the 
        case of double cropping, as determined by the Secretary.

                proportionately reduce base acres on a farm for covered 
                commodities and cotton for land that has been 
                subdivided and developed for multiple residential units 
                or other nonfarming uses if the size of the tracts and 
                the density of the subdivision is such that the land is 
                unlikely to return to the previous agricultural use, 
                unless the producers on the farm demonstrate that the 
                land--
                            (i) remains devoted to commercial 
                        agricultural production; or
                            (ii) is likely to be returned to the 
                        previous agricultural use.
                    (B) Requirement.--The Secretary shall establish 
                procedures to identify land described in subparagraph 
                (A).

SEC. 1106. PAYMENT YIELDS.

    (a) Establishment and Purpose.--For the purpose of making payments 
under this subtitle, the Secretary shall provide for the establishment 
of a yield for each farm for any designated oilseed for which a payment 
yield was not established under section 1102 of the Food, Conservation, 
and Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8712) in accordance with this section.
    (b) Payment Yields for Designated Oilseeds.--
            (1) Determination of average yield.--In the case of 
        designated oilseeds, the Secretary shall determine the average 
        yield per planted acre for the designated oilseed on a farm for 
        the 1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in 
        which the acreage planted to the designated oilseed was zero.
            (2) Adjustment for payment yield.--
                    (A) In general.--The payment yield for a farm for a 
                designated oilseed shall be equal to the product of the 
                following:
                            (i) The average yield for the designated 
                        oilseed determined under paragraph (1).
                            (ii) The ratio resulting from dividing the 
                        national average yield for the designated 
                        oilseed for the 1981 through 1985 crops by the 
                        national average yield for the designated 
                        oilseed for the 1998 through 2001 crops.
                    (B) No national average yield information 
                available.--To the extent that national average yield 
                information for a designated oilseed is not available, 
                the Secretary shall use such information as the 
                Secretary determines to be fair and equitable to 
                establish a national average yield under this section.
            (3) Use of county average yield.--If the yield per planted 
        acre for a crop of a designated oilseed for a farm for any of 
        the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent of 
        the county yield for that designated oilseed, the Secretary 
        shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of 
        the county yield for the purpose of determining the average 
        under paragraph (1).
            (4) No historic yield data available.--In the case of 
        establishing yields for designated oilseeds, if historic yield 
        data is not available, the Secretary shall use the ratio for 
        dry peas calculated under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) in determining 
        the yields for designated oilseeds, as determined to be fair 
        and equitable by the Secretary.
    (c) Effect of Lack of Payment Yield.--
            (1) Establishment by secretary.--If no payment yield is 
        otherwise established for a farm for which a covered commodity 
        is planted and eligible to receive price loss coverage 
        payments, the Secretary shall establish an appropriate payment 
        yield for the covered commodity on the farm under paragraph 
        (2).
            (2) Use of similarly situated farms.--To establish an 
        appropriate payment yield for a covered commodity on a farm as 
        required by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take into 
        consideration the farm program payment yields applicable to 
        that covered commodity for similarly situated farms. The use of 
        such data in an appeal, by the Secretary or by the producer, 
        shall not be subject to any other provision of law.
    (d) Single Opportunity To Update Yields Used To Determine Price 
Loss Coverage Payments.--
            (1) Election to update.--At the sole discretion of the 
        owner of a farm, the owner of a farm shall have a 1-time 
        opportunity to update the payment yields on a covered 
        commodity-by-covered-commodity basis that would otherwise be 
        used in calculating any price loss coverage payment for covered 
        commodities on the farm.
            (2) Time for election.--The election under paragraph (1) 
        shall be made at a time and manner to be in effect for the 2014 
        crop year as determined by the Secretary.
            (3) Method of updating yields.--If the owner of a farm 
        elects to update yields under this subsection, the payment 
        yield for a covered commodity on the farm, for the purpose of 
        calculating price loss coverage payments only, shall be equal 
        to 90 percent of the average of the yield per planted acre for 
        the crop of the covered commodity on the farm for the 2008 
        through 2012 crop years, as determined by the Secretary, 
        excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the 
        crop of the covered commodity was zero.
            (4) Use of county average yield.--If the yield per planted 
        acre for a crop of the covered commodity for a farm for any of 
        the 2008 through 2012 crop years was less than 75 percent of 
        the average of the 2008 through 2012 county yield for that 
        commodity, the Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop 
        year equal to 75 percent of the average of the 2008 through 
        2012 county yield for the purposes of determining the average 
        yield under paragraph (3).
            (5) Effect of lack of payment yield.--
                    (A) Establishment by secretary.--For purposes of 
                this subsection, if no payment yield is otherwise 
                established for a covered commodity on a farm, the 
                Secretary shall establish an appropriate updated 
                payment yield for the covered commodity on the farm 
                under subparagraph (B).
                    (B) Use of similarly situated farms.--To establish 
                an appropriate payment yield for a covered commodity on 
                a farm as required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary 
                shall take into consideration the farm program payment 
                yields applicable to that covered commodity for 
                similarly situated farms. The use of such data in an 
                appeal, by the Secretary or by the producer, shall not 
                be subject to any other provision of law.

SEC. 1107. FARM RISK MANAGEMENT ELECTION.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Payments required.--Except as provided in paragraph 
        (2), if the Secretary determines that payments are required 
        under subsection (b)(1) or (c)(2) for a covered commodity, the 
        Secretary shall make payments for that covered commodity 
        available under such subsection to producers on a farm pursuant 
        to the terms and conditions of this section.
            (2) Prohibition on payments; exceptions.--Notwithstanding 
        any other provision of this title, a producer on a farm may not 
        receive price loss coverage payments or revenue loss coverage 
        payments if the sum of the planted acres of covered commodities 
        on the farm is 10 acres or less, as determined by the 
        Secretary, unless the producer is--
                    (A) a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher (as 
                defined in section 355(e) of the Consolidated Farm and 
                Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2003(e))); or
                    (B) a limited resource farmer or rancher, as 
                defined by the Secretary.
    (b) Price Loss Coverage.--
            (1) Payments.--For the 2014 crop year and each succeeding 
        crop year, the Secretary shall make price loss coverage 
        payments to producers on a farm for a covered commodity if the 
        Secretary determines that--
                    (A) the effective price for the covered commodity 
                for the crop year; is less than
                    (B) the reference price for the covered commodity 
                for the crop year.
            (2) Effective price.--The effective price for a covered 
        commodity for a crop year shall be the higher of--
                    (A) the midseason price; or
                    (B) the national average loan rate for a marketing 
                assistance loan for the covered commodity in effect for 
                such crop year under subtitle B.
            (3) Payment rate.--The payment rate shall be equal to the 
        difference between--
                    (A) the reference price for the covered commodity; 
                and
                    (B) the effective price determined under paragraph 
                (2) for the covered commodity.
            (4) Payment amount.--If price loss coverage payments are 
        required to be provided under this subsection for the 2014 crop 
        year or any succeding crop year for a covered commodity, the 
        amount of the price loss coverage payment to be paid to the 
        producers on a farm for the crop year shall be equal to the 
        product obtained by multiplying--
                    (A) the payment rate for the covered commodity 
                under paragraph (3);
                    (B) the payment yield for the covered commodity; 
                and

        1104(16) in order to reflect price premiums.
    (c) Revenue Loss Coverage.--
            (1) Available as an alternative.--As an alternative to 
        receiving price loss coverage payments under subsection (b) for 
        a covered commodity, all of the owners of the farm may make a 
        one-time, irrevocable election on a covered commodity-by-
        covered-commodity basis to receive revenue loss coverage 
        payments for each covered commodity in accordance with this 
        subsection. If any of the owners of the farm make different 
        elections on the same covered commodity on the farm, all of the 
        owners of the farm shall be deemed to have not made the 
        election available under this paragraph.
            (2) Payments.--In the case of owners of a farm that make 
        the election described in paragraph (1) for a covered 
        commodity, the Secretary shall make revenue loss coverage 
        payments available under this subsection for the 2014 crop year 
        and each succeeding crop year if the Secretary determines

                    (A) the actual county revenue for the crop year for 
                the covered commodity; is less than
                    (B) the county revenue loss coverage trigger for 
                the crop year for the covered commodity.
            (3) Time for payments.--If the Secretary determines under 
        this subsection that revenue loss coverage payments are 
        required to be provided for the covered commodity, payments 
        shall be made beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable 
        thereafter, after the end of the applicable marketing year for

        section, as the ``Second Morrill Act''; 7 U.S.C. 321 et seq.)

        of agriculture and mechanic arts for over a century;
            (2) in addition to those institutions, a number of colleges 
        and universities have fulfilled similar and parallel missions 
        in successfully training and graduating generations of students 
        who have gone on to be leaders in their field;
            (3) the colleges and universities, both with and without 
        designation under the Second Morrill Act, fulfill a vital role 
        to the future of industry, opportunities for increased job 
        creation, and the strength of agriculture in the United States;
            (4) Congress must ensure that the United States' higher 
        education framework and policies meet the needs of young 
        individuals in the United States, and that students from across 
        the country are able to choose from a variety of institutions 
        and programs that will equip them with the skills and training 
        necessary to achieve their individual goals; and
            (5) as Congress and the agricultural community generally 
        consider policies and approaches to improve research, 
        extension, and education in the agricultural sciences, 
        expansion of the land grant program under the Second Morrill 
        Act to include enhanced funding and additional institutions 
        should be considered.

SEC. 11313. INCREASED PROTECTION FOR AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS IN THE 
              MISSOURI RIVER BASIN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Record runoff occurred in the Missouri River basin 
        during 2011 as a result of historic rainfall over portions of 
        the upper basin coupled with heavy plains and mountain 
        snowpack.
            (2) Runoff above Sioux City, Iowa, during the 5-month 
        period of March through July totaled an estimated 48.4 million 
        acre-feet (referred to in this section as ``MAF''). This runoff 
        volume was more than 20 percent greater than the design storm 
        for the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System (referred to 
        in this section as the ``System''), which was based on the 1881 
        runoff of 40.0 MAF during the same 5-month period.
            (3) During the 2011 runoff season, nearly 61 million acre-
        feet of water entered the Missouri River system, far surpassing 
        the previous record of 49 MAF in runoff that was set during the 
        flood of 1997.
            (4) Given the incredible amount of water entering the 
        System, the summer months were spent working to evacuate as 
        much water from the System as possible, ultimately leading to 
        record high water releases from Gavins Point Dam of 160,000 
        cubic feet per second, a rate that more than doubled the 
        previous release record of 70,000 cubic feet per second set in 
        1997.
            (5) For nearly four months, those extremely high releases 
        from Gavins Point were maintained, resulting in severe and 
        sustained flooding, with much of western Iowa and eastern 
        Nebraska as well as portions of South Dakota, Kansas, and 
        Missouri inundated by a flooding river three to five feet deep, 
        up to 11 miles wide, and flowing at a rate of 4 to 11 miles per 
        hour.
            (6) Thousands of homes and businesses were damaged or 
        destroyed and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage was 
        done to roads and other public infrastructure.
            (7) In addition to the homes, businesses, and 
        infrastructure impacted by the flooding, hundreds of thousands 
        of acres of cropland were affected.
            (8) The Department of Agriculture has estimated that 
        400,000 to 500,000 acres of some of the most productive crop 
        land in the world was flooded in 2011.
            (9) Local Farm Services Agency representatives have 
        estimated that $82,100,000 was lost in 2011 alone due to 
        damaged or lost crops and unplanted acres.
            (10) Not only did the flooding eliminate the 2011 crop, but 
        it is highly unlikely that many farmers will be able to put 
        that land back into production at any point in the near future.
            (11) Producers will have to contend with large piles of 
        sand, silt, and other debris that have been deposited in their 
        fields, meaning the impact of the 2011 flood will be felt in 
        the agricultural communities up and down the Missouri River for 
        many years to come.
            (12) Currently, the amount of storage capacity in the 
        System that is set aside for flood control is based upon the 
        vacated space required to control the 1881 flood, because prior 
        to the 2011 flood, the 1881 flood was seen as the ``high water 
        mark''.
            (13) Given the historic flooding that took place in 2011, 
        it is clear that year's flooding now represents a new ``high 
        water mark'', surpassing the flooding of even the 1881 flood.
            (14) It is important that the flood control related 
        functions of the System management be adjusted to reflect the 
        reality of the 2011 flood as the new ``worst case scenario'' 
        for flooding along the Missouri River.
            (15) System management may begin to be adjusted to account 
        for the 2011 flood through a recalculation of the amount of 
        storage space within the System that is allocated to flood 
        control, using the model not of the 1881 flood, but of the 
        greatest flood experienced--the flood of 2011.
            (16) As a result of the flooding in 2011, many States 
        received disaster declarations from the Department of 
        Agriculture to help farmers and producers recover from the 
        damage done by the high water.
            (17) Though helpful, even the assistance provided by the 
        Department of Agriculture will not provide many in the 
        agriculture community with the resources to put their land back 
        into production any time soon.
            (18) Without the protection that will come from a 
        fundamental change in the System's flood control storage 
        allocations, farmers, producers, and other agricultural 
        interests who may be in a position to restart their operations 
        will find it difficult to justify doing so, given the fact that 
        they will not be protected from similar flooding in the future.
    (b) Updated Management of the Missouri River To Protect 
Agricultural Interests.--In order to strengthen the agricultural 
economy, revitalize the rural communities, and conserve the natural 
resources of the Missouri River basin, the Congress directs that the 
Secretary of Agriculture take action to promote immediate increased 
flood protection to farmers, producers, and other agricultural 
interests in the Missouri River basin by working within its 
jurisdiction to support efforts--
            (1) to recalculate the amount of space within the System 
        that is allocated to flood control storage using the 2011 flood 
        as the model; and
            (2) to increase the Missouri River's channel capacity 
        between the reservoirs and below Gavins Point.

SEC. 11314. INCREASED PROTECTION FOR AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS IN THE 
              BLACK DIRT REGION.

    In order to strengthen the agricultural economy, revitalize the 
rural communities, and conserve the natural resources of the Black Dirt 
region, the Congress directs that the Secretary of Agriculture take 
action to promote immediate increased flood protection to farmers, 
producers, and other agricultural interests around the Wallkill River 
and in the Black Dirt region.

            (5) it is critical that the Department of Agriculture 
        participates fully in the development of any such security 
        programs to ensure that they do not unnecessarily restrict the 
        availability of the most efficient and beneficial products 
        needed to sustain agriculture in the United States;
            (6) the Secretary of Agriculture should review staffing at

        within the Department at the Senior Executive Service level or 
        higher, who have responsibility for coordinating with other 
        Federal, State, and international agencies in the development 
        of regulations, guidance, and procedures for the secure 
        handling of agricultural chemicals; and
            (7) such employees shall--
                    (A) work with manufacturers, retailers, and the 
                general farm community to review existing and proposed 
                Federal, State, and international agricultural chemical 
                security regulations;
                    (B) coordinate with manufacturers, retailers, 
                transporters, and farmers to evaluate how existing and 
                proposed security regulations, including systems to 
                track the sale, transportation, delivery, and use of 
                agricultural products, can be designed to minimize any 
                adverse impact on agricultural productivity;
                    (C) evaluate how existing and proposed security 
                regulations will affect the ability of agricultural 
                producers to have timely access to nutrients, 
                chemicals, and other products that are affordable and 
                best suited to the producers' operations;
                    (D) develop recommendations on best practices, 
                policies, and regulatory mechanisms relating to 
                existing and proposed security programs to ensure that 
                there is minimal adverse impact on agricultural 
                productivity; and
                    (E) engage with Federal agencies with 
                responsibility for establishing security programs to 
                ensure that they have the information needed to develop 
                procedures for effective security administration and 
                enforcement that minimize any adverse impact on 
                domestic or international agricultural productivity.

SEC. 11326. REPORT ON NATIONAL OCEAN POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Executive Order 13547, issued on July 19, 2010, 
        established the national policy for the Stewardship of the 
        Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes and requires--
                    (A) Federal implementation of ``ecosystem-based 
                management'' to achieve a ``fundamental shift'' in how 
                the United States manages ocean, coastal, and Great 
                Lakes resources; and
                    (B) the establishment of nine new governmental 
                ``Regional Planning Bodies'' and ``Coastal and Marine 
                Spatial Plans'' in every region of the United States.
            (2) Executive Order 13547 created a 54-member National 
        Ocean Council led by the White House Council on Environmental 
        Quality and Office of Science and Technology Policy that 
        includes 54 principal and deputy-level representatives from 
        Federal entities, including the Department of Agriculture.
            (3) Executive Order 13547 requires National Ocean Council 
        members, including the Department of Agriculture, to take 
        action to implement the Policy and participate in coastal and 
        marine spatial planning to the maximum extent possible.
            (4) The Final Recommendations of the Interagency Ocean 
        Policy Task Force that were adopted by Executive Order 13547 
        state that ``effective'' implementation of the National Ocean 
        Policy will ``require clear and easily understood requirements 
        and regulations, where appropriate, that include enforcement as 
        a critical component''.
            (5) Despite repeated Congressional requests, the National 
        Ocean Council, which is charged with overseeing implementation 
        of the policy, has still not provided a complete accounting of 
        Federal activities under the policy and resources expended and 
        allocated in furtherance of implementation of the policy.
            (6) The continued economic and budgetary challenges of the 
        United States underscore the necessity for sound, transparent, 
        and practical Federal policies.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Inspector General of the Department of Agriculture 
shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry of the Senate a report detailing--
            (1) all activities engaged in and resources expended in 
        furtherance of Executive Order 13547 since July 19, 2010; and

        implementation of Executive Order 13547.
