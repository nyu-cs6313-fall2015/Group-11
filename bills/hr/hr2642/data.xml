Agricultural Act of 2014 - Title I: Commodities - Subtitle A: Repeals and Reforms - Part I: Repeals - (Sec. 1101) Repeals: (1) direct payments under the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008; and (2) countercyclical payments and the average crop revenue election program (ACRE) under the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008. Continues countercyclical payments and ACRE, however, for crop year 2013.

Part II: Commodity Policy - (Sec. 1111) Includes peanuts as a covered commodity.

(Sec. 1112) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) (the Secretary in this bill unless otherwise indicated) to notify farm owners regarding their opportunity to elect to:

 retain base acres, including generic base acres; or reallocate any base acres other than generic base acres for covered commodities, as in effect on September 30, 2013, among covered commodities planted on the farm during the 2009-2012 crop years. Deems a non-electing farm owner to have elected to retain base acres, including generic acres.

Applies such election, or deemed election, to all covered commodities on a farm.

Sets forth the reallocation formula. Directs the Secretary to provide for a farm's base acreage adjustment for covered commodities if: (1) a conservation reserve contract expires or is voluntarily terminated, (2) cropland is released from conservation reserve contract coverage, or (3) the producer has eligible oilseed acreage.

 Requires a farm owner, for the crop year in which a base acres adjustment is first made, to elect to receive either price loss coverage (PLC) or agriculture risk coverage (ARC) for the acreage added to the farm, or a prorated payment under the conservation reserve contract.

Requires the Secretary to reduce the base acres for one or more covered commodities on a farm if the sum of the base acres and certain other conservation and oilseed acreage exceeds the farm's actual cropland acreage. Exempts double-cropped acreage from such requirement. Permits the farm owner to select the base acres to be reduced.

Authorizes a farm owner to reduce the base acres for any covered commodity, whose reduction shall be permanent.

Directs the Secretary to reduce a farm's base acres for land that has been subdivided and developed for multiple residential units or other nonfarming uses if the size of the tracts and the density of the subdivision is such that the land is unlikely to return to the previous agricultural use, unless it: (1) remains devoted to commercial agricultural production, or (2) is likely to be returned to the previous agricultural use.

(Sec. 1113) Directs the Secretary to establish a yield for each farm for any designated oilseed for which a payment yield was not established.

Sets forth payment yield determination requirements, including the use of county average yields.

Grants a farm owner a one-time opportunity to update, on a commodity-by-commodity basis, the payment yield used in calculating the price loss coverage payment for each covered commodity for which the election is made.

(Sec. 1114) Declares that the payment acres:

 for each covered commodity, for PLC and ARC purposes, shall be 85% of the base acres when county coverage has been selected, and shall be 65% of the base acres for all of the farm's covered commodities, for ARC purposes, when individual coverage has been selected. Requires reduction of payment acres in any crop year in which fruits, vegetables (other than mung beans and pulse crops), or wild rice have been planted on base acres.

Prohibits PLC or ARC payments to a producer whose farm's base acres is 10 acres or less unless the producer is a socially disadvantaged or limited resource farmer or rancher.

Prohibits payment acre reductions if:

 cover crops, fruits, vegetables, or wild rice are grown for conservation purposes and not harvested for use or sale; or in any region with a history of double-cropping covered commodities with fruits, vegetables, or wild rice such crops were double-cropped. (Sec. 1115) Requires all producers on a farm to make a one-time, irrevocable election for crop years 2014-2018 to obtain:

 PLC on a covered commodity-by-covered-commodity basis, or ARC on either a county or individual basis. Declares that if all producers on a farm fail to make a unanimous election for crop year 2014:

 the Secretary shall not make PLC or ARC payments for crop year 2014, and the producers shall be deemed to have PLC for all covered commodities for crop years 2015-2018. Directs the Secretary to ensure that producers on a farm do not reconstitute the farm to void or change an election or selection made under this section.

(Sec. 1116) Directs the Secretary to make PLC payments to producers on a farm on a commodity-by-commodity basis if for any of crop years 2014-2018 the covered commodity's effective price is less than its reference price.
