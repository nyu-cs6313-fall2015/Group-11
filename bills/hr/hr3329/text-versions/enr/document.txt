Financial and Managerial Factors (12 CFR part 225 appendix C) that 
provide that the policy shall apply to bank holding companies and 
savings and loan holding companies which have pro forma consolidated

    registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    (b) Exclusions.--The Board may exclude any bank holding company or

before the date of enactment of this Act), and any small savings and 
loan holding company that would have been excepted from the provisions 
of section 171 pursuant to subparagraph (C) (as such subparagraph was 
in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act) if it 
had been a small bank holding company, shall be excepted from the 
provisions of section 171 until the effective date of the Small Bank 
Holding Company Policy Statement issued by the Board as required by
