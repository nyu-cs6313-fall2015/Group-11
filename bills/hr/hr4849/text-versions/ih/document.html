                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Clean Air Act to allow advanced biofuel, biomass-based 
diesel, and cellulosic biofuel to satisfy the mandates of the renewable 
   fuel program only if domestically produced, to eliminate the corn 
      ethanol mandate under such program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Phantom Fuels Elimination Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. ADVANCED BIOFUEL, BIOMASS-BASED DIESEL, AND CELLULOSIC BIOFUEL 
              REQUIRED TO BE PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES TO SATISFY 
              RENEWABLE FUEL PROGRAM MANDATES.

    (a) Advanced Biofuel.--Section 211(o)(1)(B)(i) of the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(B)(i)) is amended by striking ``that has 
lifecycle'' and inserting ``that is produced in the United States and 
has lifecycle''.
    (b) Biomass-Based Diesel.--Section 211(o)(1)(D) of the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(D)) is amended--
            (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``that is 
        biodiesel'' and inserting ``that is produced in the United 
        States and is biodiesel''; and
            (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``renewable fuel 
        derived from'' and inserting ``renewable fuel that is produced 
        in the United States and derived from''.
    (c) Cellulosic Biofuel.--Section 211(o)(1)(E) of the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)(E)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``renewable fuel derived from'' and 
        inserting ``renewable fuel that is produced in the United 
        States, that is derived from''; and
            (2) by inserting a comma after ``from renewable biomass''.
    (d) Waivers for Reduction of Applicable Volume in Case of 
Inadequate Supply.--
            (1) Advanced biofuel.--Section 211(o)(7) of the Clean Air 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(7)) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following:
                    ``(G) Advanced biofuel.--For any calendar year for 
                which the projected volume of advanced biofuel 
                production is less than the minimum applicable volume 
                established under paragraph (2)(B), as determined by 
                the Administrator based on the estimate provided under 
                paragraph (3)(A), not later than November 30 of the 
                preceding calendar year, the Administrator shall reduce 
                the applicable volume of advanced biofuel required 
                under paragraph (2)(B) to the projected volume 
                available during that calendar year.''.
            (2) Biomass-based diesel.--Section 211(o)(7)(E) of the 
        Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(7)(E)) is amended by adding at 
        the end the following:
                    ``(iv) Inadequate supply.--For any calendar year 
                for which the projected volume of biomass-based diesel 
                production is less than the minimum applicable volume 
                established under paragraph (2)(B), as determined by 
                the Administrator based on the estimate provided under 
                paragraph (3)(A), not later than November 30 of the 
                preceding calendar year, the Administrator shall reduce 
                the applicable volume of biomass-based diesel 
                production required under paragraph (2)(B) to the 
                projected volume available during that calendar 
                year.''.
            (3) Estimate of volumes.--Section 211(o)(3)(A) of the Clean 
        Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(3)(A)) is amended by inserting
