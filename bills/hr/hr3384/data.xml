Veterans' Entry to Apprenticeship Act - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to treat a pre-apprenticeship program as a program of apprenticeship, for purposes of providing educational assistance, if such pre-apprenticeship program: (1) is recognized under or compliant with relevant state standards for a postsecondary pre-apprenticeship program, or (2) is in a state that does not require such standards and the curriculum of the program is approved by a sponsor who certifies that the program will prepare an individual with skills and competencies needed to enroll in a registered apprenticeship program and the pre-apprenticeship program maintains conduct and attendance policies in accordance with such sponsor.

Requires that a covered individual enrolled in a pre-apprenticeship program receive the same amount and kind of educational assistance the individual would receive if the individual were enrolled in a program of apprenticeship, with an exception of specified housing assistance if the individual is not paid as part of such pre-apprenticeship program.
