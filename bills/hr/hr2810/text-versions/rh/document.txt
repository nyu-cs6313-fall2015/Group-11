                prevention laws to items and services furnished under 
                title XVIII of the Social Security Act for which 
                payment is made under an alternative payment model (as 
                defined in section 1833(z)(3)(C) of such Act (42 U.S.C.

                laws granted in support of such alternative payment 
                models, including under any potential expansion of such 
                models.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a 
        report containing the results of the study conducted under

                        Human Services (in this subsection referred to 
                        as the ``Secretary'') shall conduct a study 
                        that examines the effect of individuals' 
                        socioeconomic status on quality and resource 
                        use outcome measures for individuals under the 
                        Medicare program (such as to recognize that 
                        less healthy individuals may require more 
                        intensive interventions). The study shall use 
                        information collected on such individuals in 
                        carrying out such program, such as urban and 
                        rural location, eligibility for Medicaid 
                        (recognizing and accounting for varying 
                        Medicaid eligibility across States), and 
                        eligibility for benefits under the supplemental 
                        security income (SSI) program. The Secretary 
                        shall carry out this paragraph acting through 
                        the Assistant Secretary for Planning and 
                        Evaluation.
                            (ii) Report.--Not later than 2 years after 
                        the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
                        Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on 
                        the study conducted under clause (i).
                    (B) Study using other data.--
                            (i) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a 
                        study that examines the impact of risk factors, 
                        such as those described in section 1848(p)(3) 
                        of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-
                        4(p)(3)), race, health literacy, limited 
                        English proficiency (LEP), and patient 
                        activation, on quality and resource use outcome 
                        measures under the Medicare program (such as to 
                        recognize that less healthy individuals may 
                        require more intensive interventions). In 
                        conducting such study the Secretary may use 
                        existing Federal data and collect such 
                        additional data as may be necessary to complete 
                        the study.
                            (ii) Report.--Not later than 5 years after 
                        the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
                        Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on 
                        the study conducted under clause (i).
                    (C) Examination of data in conducting studies.--In 
                conducting the studies under subparagraphs (A) and (B), 
                the Secretary shall examine what non-Medicare data 
                sets, such as data from the American Community Survey 
                (ACS), can be useful in conducting the types of studies 
                under such paragraphs and how such data sets that are 
                identified as useful can be coordinated with Medicare 
                administrative data in order to improve the overall 
                data set available to do such studies and for the 
                administration of the Medicare program.
                    (D) Recommendations to account for information in 
                payment adjustment mechanisms.--If the studies 
                conducted under subparagraphs (A) and (B) find a 
                relationship between the factors examined in the 
                studies and quality and resource use outcome measures, 
                then the Secretary shall also provide recommendations 
                for how the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
                should--
                            (i) obtain access to the necessary data (if 
                        such data is not already being collected) on 
                        such factors, including recommendations on how 
                        to address barriers to the Centers in accessing 
                        such data; and
                            (ii) account for such factors in 
                        determining payment adjustments based on 
                        quality and resource use outcome measures under 
                        the eligible professional value-based 
                        performance incentive program under section 
                        1848(q) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.

                other risk factors affect quality and resource use 
                outcome measures and, as feasible, shall incorporate 
                information from quality and resource use outcome 
                measurement (including care episode and patient 
                condition groups) into the eligible professional value-

                        than those applied under subparagraph (A)) with 
                        an effect on quality and resource use outcome 
                        measures when determining payment adjustments

            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
        (in this subsection referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall 
        establish and implement a demonstration project (in this 
        section referred to as the ``demonstration project'') under

        for services under such title furnished by non-participating 
        physicians (as defined in section 1861(r)(1) of the Social 
        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(r)(1))) to individuals entitled

            (4) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
        conclusion of the demonstration project, the Secretary shall 
        submit to Congress a report analyzing the impact of the

                not to participate under title XVIII of the Social 
                Security Act and a comparison of such percentage and

                demonstration by specialty designation; and
                    (D) access to services for which payment is made 
                under such title for individuals entitled to benefits 
                under part A or enrolled under part B of such title.
            (5) Beneficiary notice.--
                    (A) Notice by secretary to beneficiaries.--The 
                Secretary shall notify individuals entitled to benefits 
                under part A or enrolled under part B of title XVIII of 
                the Social Security Act in the geographic area in which 
                the demonstration project is conducted of the 
                implications of physician participation in the 
                demonstration project.
                    (B) Notice by physicians to patients.--A physician 
                who elects to participate in the demonstration project 
                shall notify individuals to whom the physician 
                furnishes services for which payment will be provided 
                under the demonstration project of such election. Such 
                notification shall be provided prior to the provision 
                of service and include a notification, with respect to 
                each such individual, that--
                            (i) the right of the individual to payment 
                        is being reassigned to the physician;
                            (ii) payment for services furnished by the 
                        physician to such individual will be made

                            (iii) the individual is responsible for the 
                        remaining amount, which may be higher than 
                        would be the case if the physician participated 
                        in the Medicare program.

the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, in consultation with the Inspector General of the 
Department of Health and Human Services, shall submit to Congress a 
report with legislative recommendations to amend existing fraud and 
abuse laws, through exceptions, safe harbors, or other narrowly 
targeted provisions, to permit gainsharing or similar arrangements 
between physicians and hospitals that improve care while reducing waste 
and increasing efficiency. The report shall--
            (1) consider whether such provisions should apply to 
        ownership interests, compensation arrangements, or other 
        relationships; and
            (2) describe how the recommendations address 
        accountability, transparency, and quality, including how best 
        to limit inducements to stint on care, discharge patients 
        prematurely, or otherwise reduce or limit medically necessary 
        care; and
            (3) consider whether a portion of any savings generated by 
        such arrangements should accrue to the Medicare program under 
        title XVIII of the Social Security Act.
    (d) Promoting Interoperability of Electronic Health Record 
Systems.--
            (1) Recommendations for achieving widespread ehr 
        interoperability.--
                    (A) Objective.--As a consequence of a significant 
                Federal investment in the implementation of health 
                information technology through the Medicare EHR 
                incentive programs, Congress declares it a national 
                objective to achieve widespread and nationwide exchange 
                of health information through interoperable certified 
                EHR technology by December 31, 2019.
                    (B) Definitions.--In this paragraph:
                            (i) Widespread interoperability.--The term 
                        ``widespread interoperability'' means 
                        nationwide interoperability between certified
