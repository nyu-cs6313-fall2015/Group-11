  <summary>9/20/2013--Passed House amended.
Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act - Title I: Restoring the Commitment to Rural Counties and Schools - (Sec. 103) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) (the Secretary in this title) to establish at least one Forest Reserve Revenue Area (Area) within each unit of the National Forest System (NFS) designated for sustainable forest management for the production of national forest materials (the sale of trees, portions of trees, or forest products from NFS lands) and forest reserve revenues (to be derived from the sale of such materials in such an Area).

States that the purpose of an Area is to provide a dependable source of 25% payments and economic activity for each beneficiary county containing NFS land that was eligible to receive payments through its state under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.

Requires the Secretary to determine the annual volume requirement for each Area.

Prohibits the Secretary from reducing the number of acres of NFS land in an Area once it has been established.

(Sec. 104) Instructs the Secretary to: (1) manage Areas in the manner necessary to achieve their annual volume requirement (a volume of national forest materials at least 50% of the Area's sustained yield), and (2) conduct covered forest reserve projects within those Areas in accordance with this section, which shall serve as the only means by which the Secretary will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and other applicable laws. Defines "covered forest reserve project" as one involving the management or sale of national forest materials within an Area to generate forest reserve revenues and achieve its annual volume requirement.

Requires the Secretary to complete an environmental assessment for a covered forest reserve project proposed for an Area, but does not require the Secretary to study, develop, or describe any alternative to the proposed agency action.

Makes the decision notice for a covered reserve project the final agency action, and prohibits the requirement of any additional analysis under NEPA to implement any part of the covered project.

Excludes categorically from NEPA requirements a covered forest reserve project proposed in response to a catastrophic event, that covers an area of up to 10,000 acres, or an eligible hazardous fuel reduction or forest health project involving the removal of insect-infested trees, dead or dying trees, trees presenting a threat to public safety, or other hazardous fuels within 500 feet of utility or telephone infrastructure, campgrounds, roadsides, heritage sites, recreation sites, schools, or other infrastructure.

(A "categorical exclusion" under NEPA is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementing environmental regulations and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.)

Requires the Secretary, if a proposed covered forest reserve project may affect the continued existence of endangered or threatened species, to issue a determination explaining that the proposed covered project is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Requires a written response from the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce, as appropriate, including, if it rejects that determination, recommendations for measures that will avoid the likelihood of jeopardy to an endangered or threatened species.

Prescribes requirements for administrative and judicial reviews of a covered forest reserve project.

Permits the use of all-terrain vehicles within Areas for the purpose of activities associated with the sale of national forest materials.

(Sec. 105) Requires forest reserve revenues to be used to make: (1) 25% payments to states for the benefit ofbeneficiary counties, and (2) deposits into the Knutson-Vandenburg Fund and the salvage sale fund in contributions equal to the monies collected under such Acts for projects conducted on System NFS land.

Requires the deposit of remaining forest reserve revenues into the Treasury's general fund.

(Sec. 106) Prescribes requirements for annual reports for each Area.

Title II: Healthy Forest Management and Catastrophic Wildfire Prevention - (Sec. 203) Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to NFS land, and the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to public lands, to implement a hazardous fuel reduction project or forest health project in at-risk forests in a manner that focuses on surface, ladder, and canopy fuels reduction activities.

Permits a hazardous fuel reduction project or a forest health project to include livestock grazing and timber harvest projects carried out for purposes of hazardous fuels reduction, forest health, forest restoration, watershed restoration, or threatened and endangered species habitat protection or improvement, if the management action is consistent with achieving long-term ecological restoration.

(Sec. 204) Applies the environmental assessment requirements of title I to the implementation of a hazardous fuel reduction project or a forest health project under this title.

Exempts such a project from judicial review or any federal court injunction if its primary purpose is the salvage of dead, damaged, or down timber resulting from wildfire occurring in 2013.

(Sec. 205) Allows a state governor to designate high-risk areas of federal land in the state for purposes of addressing: (1) deteriorating forest health conditions due to the bark beetle epidemic or drought, with the resulting imminent risk of devastating wildfires; and (2) the future risk of insect infestations or disease outbreaks through preventative treatments to improve forest health conditions.

 Prohibits the following federal land from being designated as a high-risk area: (1) a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, (2) federal land on which the removal of vegetation is specifically prohibited by federal statute, and (3) federal land within a National Monument.

Requires the first high-risk areas, for 20 years duration, to be designated within 60 days of enactment of this Act but permits the designation of high-risk areas at any time.

Declares that designation of a high-risk area shall not be construed to limit or restrict: (1) access to federal land included in the area for hunting, fishing, and other related purposes; or (2) valid and existing rights regarding such land.

(Sec. 206) Allows a state governor, upon designation of a high-risk area in the state, to provide for the development of proposed hazardous fuel reduction projects or forest health projects for the high-risk area.

Requires the governor to submit proposed emergency hazardous fuel reduction projects and forest health projects to the Secretary concerned for implementation.

(Sec. 207) Bars the Secretary of Agriculture from conducting any prescribed fire (except as part of wildfire suppression activities) in the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project until the following report is submitted to Congress.

Directs the Secretary to report an evaluation of recent and current Forest Service management practices for the Forest, including lands in the Forest enrolled, or under consideration for enrollment, in the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Project to convert certain lands into shortleaf pine-oak woodlands, to determine the impact of those management practices on forest health and tree mortality.

 Title III: Oregon and California Railroad Grant Lands Trust, Conservation, and Jobs - O&amp;C Trust, Conservation, and Jobs Act - Subtitle A: Trust, Conservation, and Jobs - Chapter 1: Creation and Terms of O&amp;C Trust - (Sec. 311) Establishes the Oregon and California Railroad Grant Lands Trust to produce annual maximum sustained revenues in perpetuity for Trust counties by managing the timber resources on Trust lands on a sustained-yield basis subject to the management requirements of this chapter.

States that such Trust land comprises all lands (with certain exceptions) containing specified stands of timber located, as of January 2013, on Oregon and California Railroad Grant lands and O&amp;C Region Public Domain lands.

(Sec. 312) Declares that all right, title, and interest in the O&amp;C Trust lands remain in the United States, except that: (1) the Board of Trustees (the Board in this title) shall have all authority to manage the surface estate of the O&amp;C Trust lands and the resources found there, (2) actions on the O&amp;C Trust land shall be deemed to involve no federal action or federal discretionary involvement or control and the laws of Oregon shall apply to the surface estate of the O&amp;C Trust lands in the manner applicable to privately owned timberlands in Oregon, and (3) the O&amp;C Trust shall be treated as the beneficial owner of the surface estate of the O&amp;C Trust lands for purposes of all legal proceedings involving such lands.

States that, mineral and other subsurface rights in the O&amp;C Trust lands are retained by the United States or other owner of such rights as of the date on which management authority over the surface estate of the lands is transferred to the O&amp;C Trust.

Allows the Board to: (1) utilize rock or gravel within existing quarries on any Oregon and California Railroad Grant lands and O&amp;C Region Public Domain lands, with certain exceptions; and (2) construct new quarries, of no more than five acres, on O&amp;C Trust lands.

Requires the Board to assume authority and responsibility over, and have authority to use, all roads and specified road systems.

(Sec. 313) Authorizes the Governor of a state to appoint a Board of Trustees, whose members meet certain requirements, to administer the O&amp;C Trust and O&amp;C Trust lands.

(Sec. 314) Requires the Board to administer the O&amp;C Trust lands in compliance with all federal and state laws in the same manner as those laws apply to private forest lands.

Requires the Board to approve and periodically update management and timber sale plans.

Directs the Board to: (1) manage at least 50% of the harvestable acres of the O&amp;C Trust lands on a 100-120 year rotation, and (2) establish a program for the sale of timber set aside for purchase by business entities with 500 or fewer employees.

Requires the Board to sell timber on a competitive bid basis, at least 50% of it by oral bidding.

Makes it a condition on the sale of timber or other forest products from O&amp;C Trust lands that unprocessed timber harvested from such lands may not be exported. Prohibits knowing violators of this condition from purchasing timber from O&amp;C Trust lands or federal lands. Imposes the same disqualification on any person who uses unprocessed timber harvested from O&amp;C Trust lands in substitution for exported unprocessed timber originating from private lands.

Directs the Board to develop an integrated pest and vegetation management plan which allows for the eradication, containment, and suppression of disease, pests, weeds and noxious plants, and invasive species.

Requires O&amp;C Trust lands to include harvest area tree and retention requirements consistent with state law.

Subjects timber harvesting on O&amp;C Trust lands in riparian areas to specified limitations.

Prescribes requirements for reciprocal fire protection agreements regarding the Oregon and California Railroad Grant lands and O&amp;C Region Public Domain lands.

(Sec. 315) Prescribes requirements for calculation and distribution of payments made to each O&amp;C Trust county.

Directs the Board to generate a reserve fund, to be maintained with an annual balance of $125 million, from which to: (1) pay management and administrative expenses or capital improvement costs on O&amp;C Trust lands, and (2) make payments to O&amp;C Trust counties when regular payments to them are projected to be 90% or less of the previous year's payments.

Directs the Board to use a portion of revenues generated from activity on the O&amp;C Trust lands to establish a O&amp;C Trust Conservation Fund to: (1) fund the voluntary acquisition of conservation easements from willing private landowners in the state; (2) fund watershed restoration, remediation, and enhancement projects within the state; or (3) contribute to balancing values in a land exchange with willing private landowners if the exchange will result in a net increase in ecosystem benefits for fish, wildlife, or rare native plants.

(Sec. 316) Authorizes the Board, subject to approval by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture (the Secretary concerned), to negotiate proposals for land exchanges with owners of lands adjacent to O&amp;C Trust lands in order to create larger contiguous blocks of land under O&amp;C Trust management to facilitate resource management, improve the conservation value of such lands, or improve the efficiency of the management of those lands.

Specifies criteria a proposed land exchange must meet to win approval.

Prohibits the approval of land exchanges that, taken together with all previous exchanges involving the O&amp;C Trust lands, have the effect of reducing the total acreage of the O&amp;C Trust lands by more than 5%.
