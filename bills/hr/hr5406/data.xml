Passport Revocation Act - Amends the Passport Act of 1926 to prohibit, with a discretionary exception for emergency or humanitarian reasons, the Secretary of State from issuing a passport or passport card to an individual who is a member of, affiliated with, or is otherwise helping a foreign terrorist organization.

 Directs the Secretary to revoke a passport or passport card previously issued to any such individual. Authorizes the Secretary, before revocation, to: (1) limit a previously issued passport or passport card only for return travel to the United States, or (2) issue a limited passport or passport card that only permits return travel to the United States.</summary>
