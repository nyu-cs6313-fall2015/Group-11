To amend title III of the Social Security Act to prevent the payment of 
           unemployment benefits to incarcerated individuals.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Permanently Ending Receipt by 
Prisoners Act''.

SEC. 2. PREVENTING THE PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO INCARCERATED 
              INDIVIDUALS.

    (a) In General.--Section 303 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
503) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(m)(1) In order to obtain the information necessary to carry out 
the provisions of a State law under which an individual who is confined 
in a jail, prison, or other penal institution or correctional facility 
pursuant to his conviction of a criminal offense is ineligible for 
regular compensation on account of such individual's inability to 
satisfy the requirement under subsection (a)(12), the State agency 
charged with the administration of the State law shall seek such 
information--
            ``(A) from the Commissioner of Social Security under 
        sections 202(x)(3)(B)(iv) and 1611(e)(1)(I)(iii); and
            ``(B) through such additional means as the State agency 
        considers appropriate.
    ``(2) If the Secretary of Labor, after reasonable notice and 
opportunity for hearing to the State agency charged with the 
administration of the State law, finds that there is a failure to 
comply substantially with the requirements of paragraph (1), the 
Secretary of Labor shall notify such State agency that further payments 
will not be made to the State until the Secretary of Labor is satisfied 
that there is no longer any such failure. Until the Secretary of Labor 
is so satisfied, such Secretary shall make no future certification to 
the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to such State.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
take effect on the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, except that the Secretary of Labor may delay the application 
of the requirement imposed by such amendment until a date that is not 
later than 3 years after such date of enactment with respect to any 
State for which the Secretary determines that additional time is 
necessary to satisfy such requirement.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
