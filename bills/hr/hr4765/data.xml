Amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to: (1) expand the availability of free fruits and vegetables in elementary and secondary schools, child care centers, and family child care homes; (2) expand summer food service programs for children; and (3) establish a program providing nutritious food to at-risk school children on weekends and during extended school holidays during the school year.

 Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a grant program to enable local and tribal governments to conduct food security assessments.

 Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of HHS to establish programs to reduce and prevent obesity in children.

 Requires the Secretaries of Education and HHS to award grants for health and fitness programs in secondary schools in low-income communities.

 Requires the Secretary of HHS to award grants to states for a community navigator program.

Expands coverage of obesity treatment and prevention programs and services in federal programs.
