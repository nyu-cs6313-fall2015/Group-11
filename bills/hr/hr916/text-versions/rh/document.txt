to: resource development and conservation, agricultural use, active 
forest management, environmental protection, and use of real property.
    (b) Cost-Sharing.--The Secretary may enter into cost-sharing 
agreements with States to include any non-Federal lands in a State in

exceed 50 percent of the total cost to a State for the development of 
the cadastre of non-Federal lands in the State.
    (c) Consolidation and Report.--Not later than 180 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report 
to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate on--
            (1) the existing real property inventories or any 
        components of any cadastre currently authorized by law or 
        conducted by the Department of the Interior, the statutory 
        authorization for such, and the amount expended by the Federal 
        Government for each such activity in fiscal year 2012;
            (2) the existing real property inventories or any 
        components of any cadastre currently authorized by law or

        eliminated or consolidated into the multipurpose cadastre 
        authorized by this Act;
            (3) the existing real property inventories or any 
        components of a cadastre currently authorized by law or 
        conducted by the Department of the Interior that will not be 
        eliminated or consolidated into the multipurpose cadastre 
        authorized by this Act, together with a justification for not

        State or local government that can be used to identify Federal 
        real property within such unit of government;
            (5) the cost-savings that will be achieved by eliminating 
        or consolidating duplicative or unneeded real property 
        inventories or any components of a cadastre currently 
        authorized by law or conducted by the Department of the 
        Interior that will become part of the multipurpose cadastre 
        authorized by this Act;
            (6) in consultation with the Director of the Office of 
        Management and Budget, the Administrator of the General

            (7) recommendations for any legislation necessary to 
        increase the cost-savings and enhance the effectiveness and 
        efficiency of replacing, eliminating, or consolidating real 
        property inventories or any components of a cadastre currently 
        authorized by law or conducted by the Department of the 
        Interior.
