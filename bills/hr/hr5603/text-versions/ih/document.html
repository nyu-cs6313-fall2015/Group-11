SECTION 1. LAKE FANNIN CONVEYANCE, CADDO NATIONAL GRASSLANDS, FANNIN 
              COUNTY, TEXAS.

    (a) Conveyance Required.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall 
convey, without consideration, to Fannin County, Texas (in this section 
referred to as the ``County''), all right, title, and interest of the 
United States in and to a parcel of real property, including all 
improvements thereon, consisting of approximately 2,025 acres and known 
as the Lake Fannin Tract of the Caddo National Grasslands in Fannin 
County, Texas, as depicted on the map titled ``Lake Fannin Proposal-
Caddo National Grasslands'' and dated November 21, 2013, for the 
purpose of permitting the County to protect and restore the historic 
structures on the property and to use the property for recreational 
purposes.
    (b) Payment of Costs of Conveyance.--
            (1) Payment required.--The Secretary shall require the 
        County to cover costs to be incurred by the Secretary, or to 
        reimburse the Secretary for such costs incurred by the 
        Secretary, to carry out the conveyance under subsection (a), 
        including survey costs, costs for environmental documentation, 
        and any other administrative costs related to the conveyance. 
        If amounts are collected from the County in advance of the 
        Secretary incurring the actual costs, and the amount collected 
        exceeds the costs actually incurred by the Secretary to carry 
        out the conveyance, the Secretary shall refund the excess 
        amount to the County.
            (2) Treatment of amounts received.--Amounts received as 
        reimbursement under paragraph (1) shall be credited to the fund 
        or account that was used to cover those costs incurred by the 
        Secretary in carrying out the conveyance. Amounts so credited 
        shall be merged with amounts in such fund or account, and shall 
        be available for the same purposes, and subject to the same 
        conditions and limitations, as amounts in such fund or account.
    (c) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal 
description of the property to be conveyed under subsection (a) shall 
be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary.
    (d) Boundary Adjustment.--The Secretary shall adjust the boundaries 
of the Caddo National Grasslands to reflect the conveyance under
