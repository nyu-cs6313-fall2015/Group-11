of any delinquent tax liability owed to the United States or any State 
or local government entity.
    ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `delinquent tax liability' means

    If a Member of Congress reports a delinquent tax liability on the 
Member's annual disclosure form required under section 102(a)(9) of the 
Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (as added by section 2), the 
appropriate congressional ethics committee shall immediately open an 
inquiry into the tax delinquency of that Member for purposes of--
            (1) determining the total delinquent tax liability of the 
        Member;
            (2) determining the reason the Member has incurred a 
        delinquent tax liability;
            (3) determining whether the Member has a plan to eliminate 
        such delinquent tax liability; and
            (4) determining whether such delinquent tax liability has 
        reflected poorly on Congress.

SEC. 4. FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY.

    A Member of Congress who discloses a delinquent tax liability under 
section 102(a)(9) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (as added by 
section 2) shall, not later than 30 calendar days after filing the 
form, arrange with the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief 
Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, as appropriate, 
and the Internal Revenue Service to have the Member's salary reduced by 
an amount appropriate to pay the taxes owed to the United States within 
a reasonable time period.

SEC. 5. MEMBER OF CONGRESS DEFINED.

Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, the 
Congress.
