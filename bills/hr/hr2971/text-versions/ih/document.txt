2013''.

SEC. 2. INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT FOR HIGHLY EFFICIENT COMBINED HEAT AND 
              POWER SYSTEM PROPERTY.

    (a) In General.--Clause (i) of section 48(a)(2)(A) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``and'' at the end of 
subclause (III), by redesignating subclause (IV) as subclause (V), and 
by inserting after subclause (III) the following new subclause:
                                    ``(IV) energy property described in 
                                paragraph (3)(A)(viii), and''.
    (b) Treated as Energy Property.--Subparagraph (A) of section

                            ``(viii) highly efficient combined heat and 
                        power system property,''.
    (c) Highly Efficient Combined Heat and Power System Property.--
Subsection (c) of section 48 of such Code is amended by adding at the 
end the following new paragraph:
            ``(5) Highly efficient combined heat and power system 
        property.--
                    ``(A) Highly efficient combined heat and power 
                system property.--The term `highly efficient combined 
                heat and power system property' means property at an 
                industrial, commercial, or institutional facility

                        electrical power, mechanical shaft power, or 
                        both, in combination with the generation of 
                        steam or other forms of useful thermal energy 
                        (including heating and cooling applications),

                        energy efficiency percentage of at least 70 
                        percent, and
                            ``(iii) is placed in service before January
