                and the assessment of need for the State.
                    ``(C) Reversion.--If the Secretary, or a State 
                acting through the State Lead Agency, makes any of the 
                determinations described in subparagraph (D) with 
                respect to a conservation easement acquired by a 
                qualified organization under the authority of 
                subparagraph (A)--
                            ``(i) all right, title, and interest of the 
                        qualified organization in and to the 
                        conservation easement shall terminate; and

                        and to the conservation easement shall revert 
                        to the State or other qualified designee as 
                        approved by the State.
                    ``(D) Determinations.--The determinations required 
                for operation of the reversionary interest retained in 
                subparagraph (C) are that--
                            ``(i) the qualified organization is unable 
                        to carry out its responsibilities under the 
                        Forest Legacy Program in the State with respect 
                        to the conservation easement;
                            ``(ii) the conservation easement has been 
                        modified in a way that is inconsistent with the 
                        purposes of the Forest Legacy Program or the 
                        assessment of need for the State; or
                            ``(iii) the conservation easement has been 
                        conveyed to another person (other than a 
                        qualified organization approved by the State 
                        and the Secretary).''.
