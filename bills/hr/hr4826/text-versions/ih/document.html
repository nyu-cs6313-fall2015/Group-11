            (2) iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods are 
        not produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably 
        available quantities and of a satisfactory quality; or
            (3) inclusion of iron, steel, and manufactured goods 
        produced in the United States will increase the cost of the 
        overall project by more than 25 percent.

it is necessary to waive the application of subsection (a) based on a 
finding under subsection (b), the Secretary shall publish in the
