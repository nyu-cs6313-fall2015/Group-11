Reserves 1% of the grant funds for assistance to outlying areas and Indian schools.\n\nRequires states to reallocate such grant funds to LEAs on the basis of each LEA's share of school improvement funds received by LEAs in the state for the previous fiscal year.\n\nDirects the Secretary to make grants to LEAs that serve areas in which the President, during the preceding 10 fiscal years, has determined that a major disaster exists for the construction, modernization, renovation, or repair of public schools, including early learning facilities and charter schools, to make them safe, healthy, high-performing, and technologically up-to-date.\n\nAllocates grant funds among such LEAs on the basis of each LEA's share of infrastructure damage inflicted on public school facilities in such areas.\n\nRequires the iron, steel, and manufactured goods used in projects funded under this Act to have been produced in this country, subject to specified exceptions."
