                      TITLE V--SENSE OF THE HOUSE

SEC. 501. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON THE NEED FOR A FAIR, BALANCED AND 
              BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO LONG-TERM DEFICIT REDUCTION.

    (a) The House finds that--
            (1) every bipartisan commission has recommended--and the 
        majority of Americans agree--that we should take a balanced, 
        bipartisan approach to reducing the deficit that addresses both 
        revenue and spending; and
            (2) sequestration is a meat-ax approach to deficit 
        reduction that imposes deep and mindless cuts, regardless of 
        their impact on vital services and investments.
    (b) It is the sense of the House that the Congress should replace 
the entire 10-year sequester established by the Budget Control Act of 
2011 with a balanced approach that would increase revenues without 
increasing the tax burden on middle-income Americans, and decrease 
long-term spending while maintaining the Medicare guarantee, protecting 
Social Security and a strong social safety net, and making strategic 
investments in education, science, research, and critical 
infrastructure necessary to compete in the global economy.
