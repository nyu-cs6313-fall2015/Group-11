SEC. 2. ALTERNATIVE SANCTIONS FOR TECHNICAL NONCOMPLIANCE WITH STARK 
              RULE UNDER MEDICARE.

    Section 1877(g) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395nn(g)) is 
amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``No'' and inserting 
        ``Subject to paragraph (7), no'';
            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``If'' and inserting 
        ``Subject to paragraph (7), if'';
            (3) in paragraph (3), by striking ``Any'' and inserting 
        ``Subject to paragraph (7), any''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(7) Alternative sanctions for technical noncompliance.--
                    ``(A) Single penalty for compensation arrangements 
                in technical noncompliance.--In the case of a 
                compensation arrangement between a physician (or an 
                immediate family member of such physician) and a person 
                or entity that is in violation of subsection (a)(1) 
                solely due to technical noncompliance, instead of the 
                sanctions described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) for 
                any such violation, the person or entity with respect 
                to such arrangement shall be subject to a single civil 
                monetary penalty under this paragraph in an amount that 
                does not exceed--
                            ``(i) in the case where the disclosure of 
                        the violation is submitted to the Secretary not 
                        later than the date that is one year after the 
                        initial date of noncompliance, $5,000; and
                            ``(ii) in the case where the disclosure of 
                        the violation is submitted to the Secretary 
                        after the date that is one year after the 
                        initial date of noncompliance, $10,000.
                    ``(B) Acceptance of voluntary disclosures.--
                            ``(i) In general.--Effective on the date of 
                        the enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary 
                        shall accept the voluntary disclosure of a 
                        technically noncompliant compensation 
                        arrangement if such voluntary disclosure is 
                        made as described in clause (iii). The 
                        Secretary may accept and reasonably rely on 
                        information provided by a person or entity that 
                        is in violation of subsection (a)(1) only 
                        because of a compensation arrangement that is 
                        technically noncompliant.
                            ``(ii) Acceptance of disclosure.--The 
                        Secretary may reject any voluntary disclosure 
                        submitted under clause (iii) within 90 days 
                        after the receipt of the disclosure only if the 
                        Secretary determines that the disclosure does 
                        not conform to the requirements described in 
                        clause (iii). If the Secretary fails to reject 
                        a voluntary disclosure within such 90-day 
                        period, the voluntary disclosure is deemed to 
                        be accepted.
                            ``(iii) Voluntary disclosure.--A voluntary 
                        disclosure described in this clause, with

                        disclosure submitted to the Secretary, by a 
                        party to such arrangement that contains the
