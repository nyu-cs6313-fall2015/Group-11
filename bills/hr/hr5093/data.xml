Children's Firearm Marketing Safety Act - Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to promulgate rules to prohibit the marketing of firearms to children, including prohibitions against:

 the use of cartoon characters to promote firearms and firearm products, firearm brand name merchandise marketed for children, the use of firearm marketing campaigns with the specific intent to appeal to children, the manufacturing of a gun with colors or designs that are specifically designed to appeal to children, and the manufacturing of a gun intended for use by children that does not clearly and conspicuously note, by specified warnings on the firearm, the risk posed by the firearm by labeling somewhere visible on the firearm. Treats violations of such rules as violations of Federal Trade Commission Act regulations regarding unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Provides for enforcement of this Act by the FTC and through civil actions by state attorneys general.</summary>
