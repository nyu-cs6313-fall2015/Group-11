        comparable foreign insurance regulatory authority as determined 
        by the Board of Governors following consultation with the State 
        insurance regulators, including the lead State insurance 
        commissioner (or similar State official) of the insurance 
        holding company system as determined by the procedures within 
        the Financial Analysis Handbook adopted by the National 
        Association of Insurance Commissioners, where the person, or 
        its principal United States insurance affiliate, has its 
        principal place of business or is domiciled, but only to the

                    ``(A) such person acts in its capacity as a 
                regulated insurance entity; and
                    ``(B) the Board of Governors does not determine 
                that the capital requirements in a specific foreign 
                jurisdiction are inadequate.
            ``(7) Capacity as a regulated insurance entity.--The term 
        `capacity as a regulated insurance entity'--
                    ``(A) includes any action or activity undertaken by

                regulated foreign subsidiary or regulated foreign

                the provision of insurance, or other activities 
                necessary to engage in the business of insurance; and
                    ``(B) does not include any action or activity, 
                including any financial activity, that is not regulated 
                by a State insurance regulator or a foreign agency or 
                authority and subject to State insurance capital 
                requirements or, in the case of a regulated foreign 
                subsidiary or regulated foreign affiliate, capital 
                requirements imposed by a foreign insurance regulatory 
                authority.''; and

        regulator or a regulated foreign subsidiary or a regulated 
        foreign affiliate of such person engaged in the business of 
        insurance, to the extent that such person acts in its capacity 
        as a regulated insurance entity.
            ``(2) Rule of construction on board's authority.--This 
        subsection shall not be construed to prohibit, modify, limit, 
        or otherwise supersede any other provision of Federal law that 
        provides the Board of Governors authority to issue regulations 
        and orders relating to capital requirements for depository 
        institution holding companies or nonbank financial companies 
        supervised by the Board of Governors.
            ``(3) Rule of construction on accounting principles.--
