                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the dependent care 
     credit to take into account expenses for care of parents and 
            grandparents who do not live with the taxpayer.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Elder Care Tax Credit Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) 70 percent of Americans who reach the age of 65 will 
        use some form of long-term care during the remainder of their 
        lives.
            (2) Unpaid family caregivers provide about 80 percent of 
        care at home. At home care can include emotional, financial, 
        nursing, social, homemaking, and other services.
            (3) Family caregivers spend about 20 hours each week 
        providing care and 58 percent of those who receive at home care 
        require intensive caregiving responsibilities that can include 
        assisting with a personal care activity, such as bathing or 
        feeding.
            (4) During 2009, more than 61,600,000 Americans served as 
        unpaid family caregivers with an economic value of 
        approximately $450,000,000,000.

              CARE SERVICES NECESSARY FOR GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT.
