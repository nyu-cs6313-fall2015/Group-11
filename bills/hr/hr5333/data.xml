  <summary>7/31/2014--Introduced.
Expanding Access for Veterans' Service Animals Act - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) certified therapeutic animals should be provided the same access to facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as service animals, and (2) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should implement a certification process for therapeutic animals that mitigate the effects of a medically diagnosed mental health condition.

Bars the Secretary from prohibiting any service animal that is allowed to access VA medical facilities from accessing the room of a patient who is receiving inpatient care at such a facility, including with respect to staying overnight. Authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations to ensure the safety and health of VA employees, patients, and the public, including by requiring that a patient maintain responsibility for such animal.</summary>
