        added by subsection (a))--

                the health of patients; and

                care provider services; and
            (2) the President and the Congress should work together to 
        develop and enact legislation that establishes a risk-based 
        regulatory framework for such clinical software and health 
        software that reduces regulatory burdens, promotes patient 
        safety, and fosters innovation.
