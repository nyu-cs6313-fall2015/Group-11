SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Multifamily Housing Energy 
Efficiency Improvement Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. STUDY OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENERGY SAVINGS IMPROVEMENTS AND 
              MORTGAGE PERFORMANCE.

    (a) Study.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in 
coordination with the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency 
and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall commence a 
study to analyze the relationship between energy savings improvements 
to homes and buildings, utility and energy expenses, and mortgage 
performance, which shall include an analysis of--
            (1) the likely increase in value of homes or buildings from 
        energy savings improvements;
            (2) the effect of energy savings improvements on mortgage 
        default rates; and
            (3) the risks of financing energy savings improvements 
        through property assessments and the risks associated with 
        providing energy efficiency products with senior liens on 
        buildings or homes.
    (b) Protection of Information.--In conducting the study required 
under subsection (a), the Secretary shall ensure that data shared with 
any third-party or published does not contain any personally 
identifiable information.
    (c) Publication.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
shall--
            (1) publish the results of the study required under 
        subsection (a) on the publicly available website of the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development; and
            (2) submit a report regarding the results of the study 
        required under subsection (a) to the Committee on Financial 
        Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on

              PROGRAMS.

    (a) Green Refinancing.--Section 223 of the National Housing Act (12 
U.S.C. 1715n) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subsection:
    ``(h) Green Refinancing.--The Secretary shall, by regulation, 
establish a green refinancing program for multifamily housing projects 
insured under subsection (f) under which any dollar amount limitations 
which would otherwise apply with respect to a project may be increased 
by up to 20 percent for the cost of residential energy conservation 
measures for the project, but the Secretary shall only insure 
residential energy conservation measures pursuant to this subsection if 
the Secretary verifies that--
            ``(1) a third-party assessment procured by the lender or 
        borrower has been conducted of the project's physical needs, 
        including an energy audit and identification of cost-effective 
        opportunities for increasing energy and water efficiency and 
        achieving a reduction in energy and water costs, and such 
        assessment indicates that such energy conservation measures 
        will be cost-effective over the life of the conservation 
        measure; and
            ``(2) such energy conservation measures will be verified 
        and monitored over the life of the mortgage, using such method 
        as the Secretary determines appropriate.
For purposes of this subsection, the term `energy conservation measure' 
has the meaning given such term in section 221(k)(3) (12 U.S.C. 
1715l(k)(3)).''.
    (b) Verification of Cost-Effectiveness of Residential Energy 
Conservation Measures.--Subsection (k) of section 221 of the National

        inserting the following:
    ``(k) Financing of Solar Energy Systems and Residential Energy 
Conservation Measures.--
            ``(1) Authority.--Subject to paragraph (2), with respect to 
        any project''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
            ``(2) Verification regarding residential energy 
        conservation measures.--The Secretary may increase the dollar 
        amount limitations pursuant to paragraph (1) with respect to a 
        project due to residential energy conservation measures for the 
        project only if the Secretary--
                    ``(A) verifies that in the case of a mortgage 
                insured under this section financing new construction 
                of the project, such measures will be cost-effective 
                over the life of the measures;
                    ``(B) in the case of a mortgage insured under this 
                section financing repair and rehabilitation of the 
                project, verifies that a third-party assessment 
                procured by the lender or borrower has been conducted 
                of the project's physical needs, including an energy 
                audit and identification of cost-effective 
                opportunities for increasing energy and water 
                efficiency and achieving a reduction in energy and 
                water costs, and such assessment indicates that the 
                energy conservation measures to be installed will be 
                cost-effective over the life of the measures; and
                    ``(C) ensures that the project is provided 
                information that will enable the project to verify and 
                monitor the energy savings achieved by the energy 
                conservation measures on a voluntary basis.
            ``(3) Definition of energy conservation measure.--For 
        purposes of this subsection, the term `energy conservation 
        measure' means, with respect to a project, any measure that 
        will result in a reduction in energy, water, or gas consumption 
        for the project.''.
    (c) Implementation.--
            (1) Guidance.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban 
        Development shall issue guidance to implement the amendments 
        made by this section not later than the expiration of the 12-
        month period beginning on the date of the enactment of this
