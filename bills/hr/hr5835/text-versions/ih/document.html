                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health 
    Service Act with respect to making progress toward the goal of 
           eliminating tuberculosis, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive TB Elimination Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Each year approximately 9,000,000 people become ill 
        with active tuberculosis (TB), an airborne infectious disease, 
        and it is estimated that 1,500,000 of those people die, making 
        TB the second leading global infectious disease killer.
            (2) There is a global underinvestment in quality TB 
        control, and in the research and development of new drugs, 
        diagnostics and a vaccine, as well as in the relationship 
        between TB and HIV/AIDS.
            (3) The increasing occurrence of multi-drug resistant 
        (``MDR'') TB, including extensively drug resistant (``XDR'') TB 
        which is resistant to at least two of the recommended first-
        line drugs and the recommended second-line medications, is a 
        serious and emerging global health problem.
            (4) Cases of TB are reported annually in every State within 
        the United States, with a total of 9,582 cases of active TB 
        reported in the United States in 2013.
            (5) In addition to those with active TB, an estimated 
        8,000,000 to 10,000,000 people in the United States are 
        infected with the TB bacteria.
            (6) Drug-resistant TB poses a particular challenge to 
        domestic TB control due to the high costs of treatment and 
        intensive health care resources required. Treatment costs for 
        MDR TB range from $100,000 to $300,000, which can cause a 
        serious strain on State public health budgets.
            (7) In 2013, the United States experienced serious 
        shortages of first- and second-line TB drugs and biologics, 
        including isoniazid, the first-line TB drug, and tubersol, the 
        biologic used in TB skin tests.
            (8) New tools are urgently needed to more effectively 
        prevent, diagnose, and treat TB. Within the last 40 years, only 
        one new TB drug has been developed and approved in the United 
        States, and the treatment regimen for MDR TB remains 
        excessively lengthy, toxic, and difficult for patients to 
        tolerate. The existing vaccine, which is not used in the United 
        States, confers no protection to adolescents and adults, 
        protecting only against pulmonary TB in infants and children.
            (9) The expertise in identifying, treating, and preventing 
        TB is within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and 
        the United States public health system. The identification and 
        preventive treatment of the millions of people in the United 
        States with TB infection, representing the reservoir of future 
        active TB cases, is a key component of the strategy to 
        eliminate TB in the United States.

SEC. 3. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.

    Clause (i) of section 506D(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and

                        decisionmaking, including by ensuring 
                        coordination between the task force established 
                        under this section and the Federal Tuberculosis 
                        Task Force under section 317E(g) of the Public 
                        Health Service Act in the development and

                        prevent and mitigate shortages of drugs used in 
                        connection with tuberculosis;''.
