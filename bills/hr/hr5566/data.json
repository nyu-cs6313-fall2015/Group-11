Limits SMART Grant eligibility to students who are pursuing a major in the physical sciences or are pursuing equivalent coursework in a qualifying liberal arts program that does not allow students to declare a major in a particular subject matter.\n\nTerminates the Secretary of Education's authority to award SMART Grants at the end of award year 2020-2021."
