    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Synthetic Abuse and Labeling of

SEC. 2. CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ANALOGUES.

    Section 203 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 813) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``A controlled'' and inserting ``(a) In 
        General.--A controlled''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(b) Determination.--In determining whether a controlled substance 
analogue was intended for human consumption under subsection (a), the 
following factors may be considered, along with any other relevant 
factors:
            ``(1) The marketing, advertising, and labeling of the 
        substance.
            ``(2) The known efficacy or usefulness of the substance for 
        the marketed, advertised or labeled purpose.
            ``(3) The difference between the price at which the 
        substance is sold and the price at which the substance it is 
        purported to be or advertised as is normally sold.
            ``(4) The diversion of the substance from legitimate 
        channels and the clandestine importation, manufacture, or 
        distribution of the substance.
            ``(5) Whether the defendant knew or should have known the 
        substance was intended to be consumed by injection, inhalation, 
        ingestion, or any other immediate means.
    ``(c) Limitation.--For purposes of this section, evidence that a 
substance was not marketed, advertised, or labeled for human 
consumption, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish that the 
substance was not intended for human consumption.''.
                                 <all>
