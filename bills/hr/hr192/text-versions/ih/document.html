SEC. 2. ACTION BY THE PRESIDENT IN CASES OF LARGE CONSECUTIVE ANNUAL 
              TRADE DEFICITS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.

    (a) Action by the President.--If in 3 consecutive calendar years 
the United States has a trade deficit with another country of 
$10,000,000,000 or more, the President shall take the necessary steps 
to create a trading relationship with the country that would eliminate 
or substantially reduce that trade deficit, by entering into an 
agreement with that country or otherwise.
    (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``trade deficit'' means, 
with respect to the United States and another country, that the value 
of goods and services that are products of that country and are 
imported into the United States from that country exceeds the value of 
goods and services that are products of the United States and are 
exported from the United States to that country.
    (c) Reports.--
            (1) Initial report.--Not later than 3 months after the date

                each country to which subsection (a) applies, as of the 
                date of the report; and
                    (B) the steps the President intends to take under
