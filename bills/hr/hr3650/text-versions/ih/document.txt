    This Act may be cited as the ``Silent Skies Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) aircraft and airport noise is one of the most common 
        ``quality of life'' nuisance issues in neighborhoods throughout 
        the United States; and
            (2) the stage 4 aircraft noise certification standard 
        became applicable to new type design aircraft in 2006 pursuant 
        to an agreement signed by the International Civil Aviation 
        Organization, of which the United States is a member.

SEC. 3. AIRCRAFT NOISE REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND 
              IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERSHIP.

    (a) Cooperative Agreement.--Subchapter I of chapter 475 of title 
49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 47511. Aircraft noise reduction technology research, 
              development, and implementation partnership
    ``(a) In General.--The Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall enter into a cooperative agreement, using a 
competitive process, with an institution, entity, or consortium to 
carry out a program for the development, maturing, and certification of 
aircraft technology that will assist in-service and in-production civil 
turbojets that have noise levels greater than the levels specified in 
stage 4 noise standards in complying with such noise standards, as 
required under subchapter II of this chapter, or more stringent noise 
standards.
    ``(b) Terms and Conditions.--The Administrator may include in a 
cooperative agreement entered into under this section terms and 
conditions requiring a recipient of funds under the cooperative 
agreement--
            ``(1) to conduct activities under the cooperative agreement 
        on a cost-shared basis, using Federal and non-Federal funds; 
        and
            ``(2) to make repayments to the United States of all or a 
        portion of the amounts received by the recipient under the 
        cooperative agreement, if an aircraft technology developed 
        under the cooperative agreement results in revenues for the 
        recipient.
    ``(c) Funding.--Of amounts appropriated under section 48102(a), not 
more than $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2014, 2015, and 2016 may

shall publish an annual report on the program established under this 
section until completion of the program.''.
