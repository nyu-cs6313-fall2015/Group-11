    ``(b) Administration.--The Work for Warriors Program shall be 
offered to, and administered by, the adjutants general appointed under

        National Guard Bureau to carry out the Work for Warriors 
        Program applies during fiscal years 2015 through 2018.
            ``(2) Extension.--Upon the expiration of the authority 
        under paragraph (1), the Chief of the National Guard Bureau may
