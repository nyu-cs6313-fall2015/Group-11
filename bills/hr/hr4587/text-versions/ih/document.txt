                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Venezuelan Human Rights and 
Democracy Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITION.

    In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' 
means--
            (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on 
        Financial Services, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the 
        Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives; 
        and
            (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on 
        Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and the Committee on the 
        Judiciary of the Senate.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On February 12, 2014, also known in Venezuela as the 
        National Youth Day, students began protesting in several cities 
        against Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro's inability to stem 
        violent crime, his undemocratic actions, and a rapidly 
        deteriorating economy marked by high inflation and shortages of 
        consumer goods.
            (2) On February 12, 2014, a judge issued an arrest warrant 
        for Leopoldo Lopez, leader of the opposition party Voluntad 
        Popular, for unfounded allegations in connection with the 
        student protests.
            (3) On February 17, 2014, the Government of Venezuela 
        notified the United States Department of State that it had 
        declared 3 consular officers at the United States Embassy in 
        Venezuela personae non gratae.
            (4) On February 18, 2014, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez 
        turned himself in to Venezuelan authorities, was arrested, and 
        charged with criminal incitement, conspiracy, arson, and intent 
        to damage property.
            (5) Leopoldo Lopez is currently being held in a prison at a 
        military facility.
            (6) Nongovernmental human rights organizations have alleged 
        that the charges brought against Leopoldo Lopez appear to be a 
        politically motivated attempt to silence dissent in the 
        country.
            (7) As of May 1, 2014, there have been 41 people killed, a 
        reported 60 cases of torture, over 100 injured, and many 
        unjustly detained in relation to pro-democracy demonstrations 
        throughout Venezuela.
            (8) On February 19, 2014, President Obama criticized the 
        Government of Venezuela for arresting protesters, called for 
        their release, and urged the government to focus on the 
        ``legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people''.
            (9) According to the Department of State's Country Reports 
        on Human Rights Practices for 2013 for Venezuela, ``The 
        principal human rights abuses reported during the year included 
        corruption, politicization in the judicial system, and 
        government actions to impede freedom of expression and restrict 
        freedom of the press. The government did not respect judicial 
        independence or permit judges to act according to the law 
        without fear of retaliation. The government used the judiciary 
        to intimidate and selectively prosecute political, union, 
        business, and civil society leaders who were critical of 
        government policies or actions. The government harassed and 
        intimidated privately owned television stations, other media 
        outlets, and journalists throughout the year, using threats, 
        fines, property seizures, targeted regulations, arrests, and 
        criminal investigations and prosecutions.''.
            (10) According to the Department of State's Country Reports 
        on Human Rights Practices for 2013 for Venezuela, ``The 
        following human rights problems were reported by NGOs, the 
        media, and in some cases the government itself: unlawful 
        killings, including summary killings by police elements; 
        torture and other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment; 
        harsh and life-threatening prison conditions and lack of due 
        process rights that contributed to widespread violence, riots, 
        injuries, and deaths in prisons; inadequate juvenile detention 
        centers; arbitrary arrests and detentions; corruption and 
        impunity in police forces; political prisoners; interference 
        with privacy rights; corruption at all levels of government; 
        threats against domestic NGOs; violence against women; anti-
        Semitism in the official media; trafficking in persons; 
        violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity; and 
        restrictions on workers' right of association.''.
            (11) According to Freedom House's Freedom in the World 
        report of 2013 on Venezuela, ``Nicolas Maduro, further weakened 
        the independent media, reduced the opposition's ability to 
        serve as a check on government policy, and made threats to 
        civil society groups.''.

SEC. 4. ACTIONS AT THE ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES.
