    under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union 
    of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their 
    Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, signed at Washington 
    December 8, 1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988 (commonly 
    referred to as the ``Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty'' or 
    ``INF Treaty'').
        (2) This behavior poses a threat to the United States, its 
    deployed forces, and its allies.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the President should hold the Russian Federation 
    accountable for being in violation of its obligations under the INF 
    Treaty; and

    completely and verifiably eliminate the military systems that 
    constitute the violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty.

        in cooperation with United States allies, to hold the Russian 
        Federation accountable for being in violation of its 
        obligations under the INF Treaty and obtain the complete and 
        verifiable elimination of its military systems that constitute 
        the violation of its obligations under the INF Treaty.
            (B) The President's assessment as to whether it remains in 
        the national security interests of the United States to remain 
        a party to the INF Treaty, and other related treaties and 
        agreements, while the Russian Federation is in violation of its 
        obligations under the INF Treaty.
            (C) Notification of any deployment by the Russian 
        Federation of a ground launched ballistic or cruise missile 
        system with a range of between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.
