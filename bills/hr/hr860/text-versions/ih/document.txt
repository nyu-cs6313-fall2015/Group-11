date of the enactment of this Act. Such report shall address the 
following issues:
            (1) The quality of biogas, including a comparison of biogas 
        to natural gas and the identification of any components of 
        biogas which make it unsuitable for injection into existing 
        natural gas pipelines.
            (2) Methods for obtaining the highest energy content in 
        biogas, including the use of co-digestion and identifying the 
        optimal feed mixture.
            (3) Recommendations for the expansion of biogas production, 
        including an analysis of the extent to which increasing the 
        methane content of biogas would result in its greater use and 
        an analysis of how the expanded use of biogas could help meet 
        the growing energy needs of the United States.
