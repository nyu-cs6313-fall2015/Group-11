  <summary>3/11/2014--Introduced.
Seniors' Rights to Know Act - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) part C (Medicare+Choice) of the Social Security Act to require the information the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) provides to promote informed choice on available part C coverage options to describe the changes for the plan year made by a Medicare Advantage (MA) organization, with respect to the MA plan it offers, pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Allows such information to assess the effect of such provisions and amendments on MA-eligible individuals who enroll under the plan.

Prohibits the Secretary from disapproving the inclusion of any such information in marketing materials or application forms unless it is factually inaccurate for the plan year for which the information is provided or any preceding plan year beginning after March 23, 2010.</summary>
