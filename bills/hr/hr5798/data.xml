  <summary>12/4/2014--Introduced.
Stability for Service Members Act - Amends the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 to extend through calendar year 2015 the one-year period after a service member's military service during which: (1) a court may stay proceedings to enforce an obligation on real or personal property owned by the service member before such military service; and (2) any sale, foreclosure, or seizure of such property shall be invalid without a court order or waiver agreement signed by the service member. (Currently, the extended one-year period is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2014, and return to a nine-month period under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.)

Revives, effective January 1, 2016 (currently, January 1, 2015), the old nine-month period in place of the one-year period granted by such Act.</summary>
