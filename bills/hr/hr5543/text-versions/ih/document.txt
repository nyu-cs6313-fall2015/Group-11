    This Act may be cited as the ``East Rosebud Wild and Scenic Rivers 
Act''.

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF WILD AND SCENIC RIVER SEGMENTS.

    Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(208) East rosebud creek, montana.--(A) The portions of 
        East Rosebud Creek in the State of Montana, consisting of--
                    ``(i) the 13-mile segment from the source in the 
                Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness downstream to the point 
                at which the Creek enters East Rosebud Lake, including 
                the stream reach between Twin Outlets Lake and Fossil 
                Lake, to be administered by the Secretary of 
                Agriculture as a wild river; and
                    ``(ii) the 7-mile segment on the Custer National 
                Forest from immediately below, but not including, the 
                outlet of East Rosebud Lake downstream to the point at 
                which the Creek enters private property for the first 
                time, to be administered by the Secretary of 
                Agriculture as a recreational river.
            ``(B) No private property shall be included within the 
        boundaries of the river segments designated by this paragraph.
            ``(C) No land or interests in land may be acquired by 
        condemnation within the boundaries of the river segments 
        designated by this paragraph.
            ``(D) Nothing in this paragraph creates or authorizes the 
        creation of a protective perimeter or buffer zone around the 
        boundaries of the river segments designated by this paragraph. 
        The fact that an activity or use can be seen or heard from 
        within such boundaries shall not preclude the conduct of that 
        activity or use outside such boundaries.''.
                                 <all>
