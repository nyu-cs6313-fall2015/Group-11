SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.

    (a) Termination of Authority To Provide Coverage.--Effective at the 
end of December 31, 2015, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (in this section referred to as the 
``Administrator'') shall not provide any new flood insurance coverage, 
or renew any coverage provided before such date, under the National 
Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.).
    (b) Treatment of Existing Coverage.--Subsection (a) shall not--
            (1) affect any flood insurance coverage provided under such 
        Act under a contract or agreement entered into before the date 
        specified in such subsection and, notwithstanding the repeals 
        under section 3, such provisions as in effect immediately 
        before such repeal shall continue to apply with respect to 
        flood insurance coverage in force after such repeal; or
            (2) require the termination of any contract or other 
        agreement for flood insurance coverage entered into before such 
        date.
    (c) Wind-Up.--After the date specified in subsection (a), the 
Administrator shall take such actions as may be necessary steps to wind 
up the affairs of the National Flood Insurance Program.
    (d) Treatment of Funds.--Amounts in the National Flood Insurance 
Fund established under section 1310 of the National Flood Insurance Act 
of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4017) and amounts in the National Flood Insurance 
Reserve Fund established under section 1310A of such Act (42 U.S.C. 
4017a) shall be available to the Administrator for performing the 
functions of the Administrator with respect to flood insurance coverage 
remaining in force after the date specified in subsection (a). Upon the 
expiration of the contracts and agreements for such coverage, any 
unexpended balances in such Funds shall be deposited in the Treasury as 
miscellaneous receipts.
    (e) Savings Provisions.--
            (1) Treatment of prior determinations.--The repeals made by 
        section 3 of the provisions of law specified in such section 
        shall not affect any order, determination, regulation, or 
        contract that has been issued, made, or allowed to become 
        effective under such provisions before the effective date of 
        the repeal. All such orders, determinations, regulations, and 
        contracts shall continue in effect until modified, superseded, 
        terminated, set aside, or revoked in accordance with law by the 
        President, the Administrator, or other authorized official, a 
        court of competent jurisdiction, or by operation of law.
            (2) Pending proceedings.--
                    (A) Effect on pending proceedings.--The repeals 
                made by section 3 shall not affect any proceedings 
                relating to the National Flood Insurance Program, 
                including notices of proposed rulemaking, pending on 
                the effective date of the repeals, before the Federal 
                Emergency Management Agency, except that no assistance 
                or flood insurance coverage may be provided pursuant to 
                any application pending on such effective date. Such 
                proceedings, to the extent that they relate to 
                functions performed by the Administrator after such 
                repeal, shall be continued. Orders shall be issued in 
                such proceedings, appeals shall be taken therefrom, and 
                payments shall be made pursuant to such orders, as if 
                this Act had not been enacted; and orders issued in any 
                such proceedings shall continue in effect until 
                modified, terminated, superseded, or revoked by the 
                Administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or 
                by operation of law.
                    (B) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection may 
                be construed to prohibit the discontinuance or 
                modification of any proceeding described in 
                subparagraph (A) under the same terms and conditions 
                and to the same extent that such proceeding could have 
                been discontinued or modified if this section had not 
                been enacted.
            (3) Actions.--This section shall not affect suits commenced 
        before the effective date of the repeals made by section 3, and 
        in all such suits, proceedings shall be had, appeals taken, and 
        judgments rendered in the same manner and effect as if this 
        section had not been enacted.
            (4) Liabilities incurred.--No suit, action, or other 
        proceeding commenced by or against an individual in the 
        official capacity of such individual as an officer of the 
        Federal Emergency Management Agency having any responsibility 
        for the National Flood Insurance Program shall abate by reason 
        of the enactment of this section. No cause of action relating 
        to such Program, by or against the Federal Emergency Management 
        Agency, or by or against any officer thereof in the official
