                            ``(iii) a description in detail of any 
                        proposed changes that should be made to the 
                        rule, the justification for such changes, all 
                        comments on such changes received by the

                        costs and benefits of such changes.
            ``(3) Limitation on new regulations.--The Secretary may not
