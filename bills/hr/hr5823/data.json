Requires selection of a methodology also for risk adjusting the rate of each potentially preventable outcome.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) give confidential reports to healthcare delivery organizations with respect to potentially preventable outcomes, (2) make information available to the public regarding potentially preventable outcomes of each applicable healthcare delivery organization, (3) apply to state plans (or waivers) under SSA title XIX (Medicaid) regulations that will relate to payment adjustments for potentially preventable outcomes, and (4) award quality improvement grants to eligible healthcare delivery organizations with an organization-specific adjustment factor lower than the factor for 75% of all other such organizations.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General (GAO) to study the impact of this Act on Medicare beneficiaries' care, Medicare expenditures, and Medicare providers."
