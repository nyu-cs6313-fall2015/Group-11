                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to create incentives 
 for healthcare providers to promote quality healthcare outcomes, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Incentivizing 
Healthcare Quality Outcomes Act of 2014''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Healthcare delivery organizations are faced with an 
        unmanageable array of quality measures and methods of risk 
        adjustment that are overly process oriented, may not relate to 
        health outcomes, and create a significant administrative 
        burden.
            (2) Existing quality measures and methods of risk 
        adjustment used to adjust Medicare payments should be replaced 
        with a comprehensive and clinically credible quality 
        measurement system based on the rate of occurrence of 
        potentially preventable outcomes.
            (3) Payment adjustment for quality outcomes should be 
        applied to all types of healthcare delivery organizations 
        including hospitals, health systems, Medicare Advantage plans, 
        health homes, and accountable care organizations as well as 
        healthcare professionals.

SEC. 2. INCENTIVIZING HEALTHCARE QUALITY OUTCOMES.

    (a) In General.--Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
section:

              ``incentivizing healthcare quality outcomes

    ``Sec. 1899B.  (a) Adjustment of Payments to Health-Care Delivery 
Organization for Potentially Preventable Outcomes.--
            ``(1) In general.--In order to provide an incentive for 
        each applicable healthcare delivery organization (as defined in 
        subsection (k)) to reduce potentially preventable outcomes, the 
        amount of payments to the organization under this title for an 
        applicable prospective period (as defined in such subsection) 
        shall be the amount otherwise determined multiplied by the 
        healthcare delivery organization-specific adjustment factor 
        determined under paragraph (2) for such period.

        individual healthcare professionals with the geographic-
        specific potentially preventable outcomes performance for a 
        geographic region under paragraph (2) for the purpose of 
        determining the potentially preventable outcomes adjustment 
        factor under paragraph (1) to the annual adjustment factor for

        healthcare delivery organization or geographic region for an 
        applicable historical period described in this paragraph is 
        equal to the sum of the following for the healthcare delivery 
        organization or geographic region and period:

        than expected) or a negative value (indicating the healthcare 
        delivery organization had fewer potentially preventable 
        outcomes than expected). The summing of the individual excess 
        potentially preventable outcomes in paragraph (1) for 
        potentially preventable outcomes allows negative values for 
        individual potentially preventable outcomes to offset in part 
        or in whole positive values of other potentially preventable

        exclude potentially preventable outcomes from the calculation 
        of aggregate payments referred to in paragraph (1) for types of
