  <summary>4/30/2014--Introduced.
Amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) to authorize the Financial Stability Oversight Council to determine that a bank holding company shall be subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, if the Council makes a final determination that material financial distress at the bank holding company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of its activities could threaten the financial stability of the United States.

 Subjects bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more to such enhanced supervision and prudential standards.

Directs the Council to: (1) review each bank holding company with total consolidated assets of between $50 billion and $250 billion in order to determine whether to subject such company to such enhanced Board supervision and prudential standards; and (2) re-review within 36 months any company not subjected to enhanced Board supervision and prudential standards, or sooner if its activities have significantly changed and it might pose a threat to U.S. financial stability.

Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) consolidated asset size is only one of many factors to be considered in determining systemic risk; and (2) specified processes identified in Dodd-Frank (as modified by this Act) represent a more accurate indicator of systemic risk.</summary>
