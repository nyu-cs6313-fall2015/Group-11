    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PROHIBITING INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT 
              DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ISRAEL FROM RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDS.

    No Federal funds appropriated after the date of the enactment of 
this Act may be used to enter into a contract, memorandum of 
understanding, or cooperative agreement with, make a grant to, award 
to, or provide a loan or loan guarantee to any institution of higher 
education that participates in a boycott of the Israeli government, 
economy, or academia. This prohibition includes any and all funds that 
would otherwise be made available by the Higher Education Act of 1965.

SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF INELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS.

    (a) Determinations.--Within 60 days of enactment of this Act, and 
every year thereafter, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the 
Secretary of Education, shall determine which institutions of higher 
education are participating in a boycott of the Israeli government, 
economy, or academia.
    (b) Criteria.--If any institution of higher education, adopts a 
policy or resolution, issues a statement, or otherwise formally 
establishes the restriction of discourse, cooperation, exchange, 
financial interaction, or any other involvement with the Israeli 
government, economy, or academia--including academic institutions or 
scholars on the basis of the connection of such institutions or such 
scholars to the State of Israel--then that institution shall be 
determined to be participating in a boycott of the Israeli government, 
economy, or academia.
    (c) Notice.--The Secretary of State shall make public a list of all 
institutions determined to be participating in a boycott of the Israeli 
government, economy, or academia pursuant to this Act, and shall notify 
each institution identified.

SEC. 3. RESTORATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR CEASING OF BOYCOTT.

    The prohibition under section 1 shall cease to apply to any 
institution of higher education that the Secretary of State, in 
coordination with the Secretary of Education, determines has ceased 
participating in a boycott of the Israeli government, economy, or 
academia.
