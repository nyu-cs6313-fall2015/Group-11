            ``(9) provide for a 7-day period, beginning on the date 
        that the hearing under paragraph (8) concludes, during which 
        the Governor of the State, may submit to the Secretary an 
        affirmation of the grant or contract, which, if not timely 
        submitted, shall preclude the Secretary from awarding the grant 
        or contract; and
            ``(10) provide for a 7-day period, beginning on the date
