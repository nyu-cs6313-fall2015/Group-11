                        by each such agency.
                            (ii) Whether the programs carried out by 
                        the agency are cost effective.
                            (iii) Whether the agency or program has 
                        acted outside the scope of its original 
                        authority, and whether the original objectives 
                        of the agency have been achieved.
                            (iv) The extent to which the jurisdiction 
                        of, and the programs administered by, the

                        jurisdiction and programs of other agencies.
                            (v) The potential benefits of consolidating 
                        programs administered by the agency with 
                        similar or duplicative programs of other 
                        agencies, and the potential for consolidating 
                        such programs.
                            (vi) The extent to which the agency has 
                        complied with the applicable provisions 
                        contained in sections 1115, 1116, 1120, 1121, 
                        1123, and 1124 of title 31, United States Code,

                            (vii) The extent to which State and local 
                        governments already collect information or 
                        perform services conducted by the Federal 
                        program or agency.
                    (B) Duplicative.--If 2 or more agencies or programs 
                are performing the same essential function and the 
                function can be consolidated or streamlined into a 
                single agency or program, the Commission shall 
                recommend that the agencies or programs be realigned.
                    (C) Wasteful or inefficient.--The Commission may 
                recommend the realignment or elimination of any agency 
                or program that has wasted Federal funds by--

                        program;
                            (ii) mismanagement of resources and 
                        personnel; or
                            (iii) use of such funds for personal 
                        benefit or the benefit of a special interest 
                        group.
                    (D) Outdated, irrelevant, or failed.--The 
                Commission shall recommend the elimination of any 
                agency or program that--
                            (i) has completed its intended purpose, if 
                        such purpose is defined under the law;
                            (ii) has become irrelevant; or
                            (iii) has failed to meet its objectives.
            (4) Relocation of federal employees.--The plan under 
        paragraph (2) shall provide that if the position of an employee 
        of an agency is eliminated as a result of the implementation of 
        the plan, the affected agency shall make reasonable efforts to 
        relocate such employee to another position within the agency or 
        within another Federal agency.
            (5) Use of savings.--All funds saved by the implementation 
        of the plan shall be used for deficit reduction.
            (6) Limitation on recommendations in plan.--The plan under 
        paragraph (2)--
                    (A) may not recommend the creation of a new agency, 
                unless such agency is the result of a consolidation of 
                existing agencies, the result of such consolidation 
                producing an overall reduction in amounts provided in 
                annual appropriations Acts and the number of personnel;
                    (B) may recommend the removal of part of an agency 
                from an agency; and
                    (C) may not recommend--
                            (i) continuing an agency beyond the period 
                        authorized by law for its existence or beyond 
                        the time when it would have terminated if the

                        beyond the time when it would have terminated 
                        if the realignment had not been made;

                        function which is not expressly authorized by

Governmental Affairs of the Senate.
    (c) Discharge.--If the committee to which a resolution described in 
subsection (a) is referred has not reported such a resolution (or an 
identical resolution) by the end of the 20-day period beginning on the 
date on which the President submits the report to Congress under 
section 4(d), such committee shall be, at the end of such period, 
discharged from further consideration of such resolution, and such 
resolution shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the House 
involved.
    (d) Consideration.--
            (1) In general.--On or after the third day after the date 
        on which the committee to which such a resolution is referred 
        has reported, or has been discharged (under subsection (c)) 
        from further consideration of, such a resolution, it is in 
        order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has 
        been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to 
        move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. A 
        Member may make the motion only on the day after the calendar 
        day on which the Member announces to the House concerned the 
        Member's intention to make the motion, except that, in the case 
        of the House of Representatives, the motion may be made without 
        such prior announcement if the motion is made by direction of 
        the committee to which the resolution was referred. The motion 
        is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and is 
        privileged in the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is 
        not subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a 
        motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A 
        motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to 
        or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed 
        to the consideration of the resolution is agreed to, the 
        respective House shall immediately proceed to consideration of 
        the joint resolution without intervening motion, order, or 
        other business, and the resolution shall remain the unfinished 
        business of the respective House until disposed of.
            (2) Debate.--Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable 
        motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited 
        to not more than 2 hours, which shall be divided equally 
        between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An 
        amendment to the resolution is not in order. A motion further 
        to limit debate is in order and not debatable. A motion to 
        postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
        business, or a motion to recommit the resolution is not in 
        order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution 
        is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.
            (3) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the 
        conclusion of the debate on a resolution described in 
        subsection (a) and a single quorum call at the conclusion of 
        the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the 
        appropriate House, the vote on final passage of the resolution 
        shall occur.
            (4) Appeals on decisions by the chair.--Appeals from the 
        decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules 
        of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may 
        be, to the procedure relating to a resolution described in 
        subsection (a) shall be decided without debate.
    (e) Consideration by Other House.--
            (1) Disposition of resolution.--If, before the passage by 
        one House of a resolution of that House described in subsection 
        (a), that House receives from the other House a resolution 
        described in subsection (a), then the following procedures 
        shall apply--
                    (A) the resolution of the other House shall not be 
                referred to a committee and may not be considered in 
                the House receiving it except in the case of final 
                passage as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii); and
                    (B) with respect to a resolution described in 
                subsection (a) of the House receiving the resolution 
                (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if 
                no resolution had been received from the other House; 
                but (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the 
                resolution of the other House.
            (2) Not in order to consider other resolution.--Upon 
        disposition of the resolution received from the other House, it 
        shall no longer be in order to consider the resolution that 
        originated in the receiving House.
    (f) Rules of the Senate and House.--This section is enacted by 
Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of a resolution described in subsection 
        (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it 
        is inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.
