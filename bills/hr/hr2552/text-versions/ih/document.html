                section 2(b) required to fulfill the purposes of such 
                wilderness are secured in accordance with subparagraphs 
                (B) through (G).

                        rights for which the Secretary pursues 
                        adjudication shall be appropriated, 
                        adjudicated, changed, and administered in 
                        accordance with the procedural requirements and 
                        priority system of State law.

                                the water rights pursued under this 
                                paragraph shall be established in 
                                accordance with State law.
                                    (II) Exception.--Notwithstanding

                                to maintain surface water levels and 
                                stream flows on and across the

                    (D) Required determination.--The Secretary shall 
                not pursue adjudication for any instream flow water

                    (E) Cooperative enforcement.--
                            (i) In general.--The Secretary shall not 
                        pursue adjudication of any Federal instream 
                        flow water rights established under this 
                        paragraph if--
                                    (I) the Secretary determines, upon 
                                adjudication of the water rights by the 
                                Colorado Water Conservation Board, that 
                                the Board holds water rights sufficient 
                                in priority, amount, and timing to 
                                fulfill the purposes of this 
                                subsection; and
                                    (II) the Secretary has entered into 
                                a perpetual agreement with the Colorado 
                                Water Conservation Board to ensure full 
                                exercise, protection, and enforcement 
                                of the State water rights within the 
                                Wilderness to reliably fulfill the 
                                purposes of this subsection.
                            (ii) Adjudication.--If the Secretary 
                        determines that the provisions of clause (i) 
                        have not been met, the Secretary shall 
                        adjudicate and exercise any Federal water 
                        rights required to fulfill the purposes of the 
                        Wilderness in accordance with this paragraph.
                    (F) Insufficient water rights.--If the Colorado 
                Water Conservation Board modifies the instream flow 
                water rights obtained under subparagraph (E) to such a 
                degree that the Secretary determines that water rights 
                held by the State are insufficient to fulfill the 
                purposes of this Act, the Secretary shall adjudicate 
                and exercise Federal water rights required to fulfill 
                the purposes of this Act in accordance with 
                subparagraph (B).
                    (G) Failure to comply.--The Secretary shall 
                promptly act to exercise and enforce the water rights 
                described in subparagraph (E) if the Secretary 
                determines that--
                            (i) the State is not exercising its water 
                        rights consistent with subparagraph (E)(i)(I); 
                        or
                            (ii) the agreement described in 
                        subparagraph (E)(i)(II) is not fulfilled or 
                        complied with sufficiently to fulfill the 
                        purposes of this Act.
            (3) Water resource facility.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of law, beginning on the date of enactment of this 
        Act, neither the President nor any other officer, employee, or 
        agent of the United States shall fund, assist, authorize, or 
        issue a license or permit for development of any new irrigation 
        and pumping facility, reservoir, water conservation work, 
        aqueduct, canal, ditch, pipeline, well, hydropower project, 
        transmission, other ancillary facility, or other water, 
        diversion, storage, or carriage structure in the wilderness 
        designated by section 2(b).
    (c) Access and Operation.--
            (1) Definition.--As used in this subsection, the term 
        ``water resource facility'' means irrigation and pumping 
        facilities, reservoirs, water conservation works, aqueducts, 
        canals, ditches, pipelines, wells, hydropower projects, and 
        transmission and other ancillary facilities, and other water 
        diversion, storage, and carriage structures.
            (2) Access to water resource facilities.--Subject to the 
        provisions of this subsection, the Secretary shall allow 
        reasonable access to water resource facilities in existence on 
        the date of enactment of this Act within the areas described in 
        sections 2(b) and 2(c), including motorized access where 
        necessary and customarily employed on routes existing as of the 
        date of enactment of this Act.
            (3) Access routes.--Existing access routes within such 
        areas customarily employed as of the date of enactment of this 
        Act may be used, maintained, repaired, and replaced to the 
        extent necessary to maintain their present function, design, 
        and serviceable operation, so long as such activities have no 
        increased adverse impacts on the resources and values of the 
        areas described in sections 2(b) and 2(c) than existed as of 
        the date of enactment of this Act.
            (4) Use of water resource facilities.--Subject to the 
        provisions of this subsection and subsection (a)(4), the 
        Secretary shall allow water resource facilities existing on the 
        date of enactment of this Act within areas described in 
        sections 2(b) and 2(c) to be used, operated, maintained, 
        repaired, and replaced to the extent necessary for the 
        continued exercise, in accordance with Colorado State law, of 
        vested water rights adjudicated for use in connection with such 
        facilities by a court of competent jurisdiction prior to the 
        date of enactment of this Act. The impact of an existing 
        facility on the water resources and values of the area shall 
        not be increased as a result of changes in the adjudicated type 
        of use of such facility as of the date of enactment of this 
        Act.
            (5) Repair and maintenance.--Water resource facilities, and 
        access routes serving such facilities, existing within the 
        areas described in sections 2(b) and 2(c) on the date of 
        enactment of this Act shall be maintained and repaired when and 
        to the extent necessary to prevent increased adverse impacts on 
        the resources and values of the areas described in sections 
        2(b) and 2(c).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
