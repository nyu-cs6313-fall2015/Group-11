        purposes of this subchapter, program-related investments--
                    ``(A) are not investments which jeopardize the 
                carrying out of one or more purposes described in 
                section 170(c)(2)(B),

                4942.
            ``(2) Program-related investments defined.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of this subchapter 
                and chapter 61, an investment made by a private 
                foundation constitutes a program-related investment 
                if--
                            ``(i) the primary purpose of the investment 
                        is to accomplish one or more of the purposes 
                        described in section 170(c)(2)(B),
                            ``(ii) no significant purpose of the 
                        investment is the production of income or the 
                        appreciation of property, and
                            ``(iii) no purpose of the investment is to 
                        accomplish one or more of the purposes 
                        described in section 170(c)(2)(D).
                    ``(B) Special rules.--For purposes of subparagraph 
                (A)--
                            ``(i) determinations of whether an 
                        investment qualifies as a program-related 
                        investment shall be based on consideration of 
                        all relevant facts and circumstances, and
                            ``(ii) the fact that the entity produces 
                        significant income or capital appreciation 
                        shall not, in the absence of other factors, be 
                        conclusive evidence of a significant purpose 
                        involving the production of income or the 
                        appreciation of property.
            ``(3) Safe harbor determinations.--The Secretary shall 
        establish a procedure which shall be substantially similar to 
        the processes for recognition of exemption under section 501(a) 
        or 4945(g) and under which an entity seeking to receive 
        program-related investments may petition the Secretary for a 
        determination that, based on consideration of all relevant 
        facts and circumstances, investments by private foundations in 
        such entity will be program-related investments meeting the 
        requirements of paragraph (2). Under this procedure, the 
        Secretary shall rule on all requests within 120 days of 
        submission.
            ``(4) Effect of determination.--Once a determination has 
        been made that investments in an entity qualify as program-
        related investments, organizations making such investments 
        shall be entitled to rely on the determination, unless and 
        until the Secretary publishes notice of revocation of the 
        determination.
            ``(5) Voluntary nature of process.--Entities seeking 
        program-related investments are not required to seek a 
        determination under paragraph (3), and the absence of such a 
        determination shall not affect the ability of a private 
        foundation to make a program-related investment based on its 
        own determination that the investment qualifies as a program-
        related investment.
            ``(6) Organizations treated as private foundations.--For 
        purposes of this subsection and section 6104A, all references 
        to private foundations include organizations that are treated 
        as private foundations under any of the provisions of sections 
        4940 through 4948, inclusive, whether created under state law 
        or the law of any federally-recognized tribe.''.
