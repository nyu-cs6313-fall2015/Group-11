United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Link Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICARE LINK PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--Title XVIII of the Social Security Act is amended 
by adding after section 1899A (42 U.S.C. 1395kkk) the following new 
section:

                     ``medicare link program option

    ``Sec. 1899B.  (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish under 
this section a program (to be known as the `Medicare Link Program' and 
in this section referred to as the `Program') through which individuals 
who are entitled to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan under part C 
but who are not enrolled in such a plan under such part are eligible to 
enroll with a Medicare Link contractor under this section.
    ``(b) Enrollment; Disenrollment.--The Secretary shall establish a 
process for the enrollment (and disenrollment) of eligible individuals 
with Medicare Link contractors under the Program which process shall 
be, to the maximum extent practicable, the same as (and coordinated 
with) the process for enrollment (and disenrollment) of individuals in 
Medicare Advantage plans under part C.
    ``(c) Qualification of Contractors; Awarding of Contracts.--
            ``(1) In general.--In this section, the term `Medicare Link 
        contractor' means a nongovernmental entity, that may be a 
        Medicare Advantage organization, health plan, health insurance 
        issuer, medicare administrative contractor, or other qualified 
        third-party entity, that has entered into a contract with the 
        Secretary with respect to one or more Medicare Link regions (as 
        specified by the Secretary under paragraph (3)) for the 
        offering of Medicare Link services (described in subsection 
        (d)) to individuals residing in the region who enroll with the 
        contractor under the Program.
            ``(2) Limitation; requirements.--For each such Medicare 
        Link region, the Secretary shall select (and contract with) at 
        least 1, and not more than 3, Medicare Link contractors for the 
        offering of plans (in this section referred to as `Medicare 
        Link plans') under this section. The Secretary shall seek to 
        contract with at least 2 Medicare Link contractors within each 
        Medicare Link region. A contract with a Medicare Link 
        contractor may cover a multi-year period.
            ``(3) Specification of medicare link regions.--The 
        Secretary shall define and specify Medicare Link regions (each 
        in this section referred to as a `Medicare Link region') that, 
        across all such regions, encompass all 50 States, the District 
        of Columbia, and the territories.
            ``(4) Qualification of contractors.--The Secretary shall 
        establish uniform qualifications for Medicare Link contractors 
        based on their experience and qualifications to offer Medicare 
        Link plans under this section and to provide additional 
        services to individuals enrolled under such plans under this 
        section and to provide for reduced expenditures under parts A 
        and B. Contracts with Medicare Link contractors under this 
        section shall be for periods similar to the contracts with MA 
        organizations under part C and shall contain such terms and 
        conditions as the Secretary shall specify.
            ``(5) Contracting authority.--Nothing in this section shall 
        be construed as preventing a Medicare Link contractor from 
        contracting with other entities in carrying out activities 
        under this section, including the offering of Medicare Link 
        plans under this section.
            ``(6) Bidding process.--In selecting Medicare Link 
        contractors, the Secretary shall establish a bidding process 
        similar to the process of bidding by medicare administrative 
        contractors under section 1874A.
            ``(7) Contractor payments.--Medicare Link contractors with 
        contracts under this section shall be paid, on a monthly basis, 
        a per enrollee monthly service fee for the provision of 
        services under the contract consistent with the provisions of 
        paragraph (8). A portion of such fee (not to exceed 5 percent) 
        may be subject to adjustment based on a contractor's 
        performance on financial and quality benchmarks based upon pre-
        established measures specified by the Secretary.
            ``(8) Requirement for federal savings under contract.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Before entering into or renewing 
                a contract with a Medicare Link contractor, the 
                Secretary must determine (and the Chief Actuary of the 
                Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services must certify) 
                that the terms of the contract are expected to yield 
                average, net savings to the Medicare program under this 
                title of not less than 5 percent per program enrollee 
                in the Medicare Link region covered under the contract.
                    ``(B) Computation.--Such savings shall be computed 
                taking into account all effects on spending under this 
                title, including any reductions in premiums and cost 
                sharing or other incentives for enrollees under 
                subsection (d), payments to Medicare Link contractors 
                under the contract, and reductions in payments to 
                medicare administrative contractors that would 
                otherwise have been made under section 1874A.
                    ``(C) Payments based on shared savings, adjusted 
                for quality.--The contract shall be structured in a 
                manner so that--
                            ``(i) subject to clause (ii), the payments 
                        to the contractor under paragraph (7) are 
                        computed to represent a proportion (as 
                        specified in the contract) of the net savings 
                        in excess of the minimum savings required under 
                        subparagraph (A); and
                            ``(ii) such proportion may be increased 
                        under the contract based on a contractor's 
                        performance on quality benchmarks, based upon 
                        pre-established measures specified by the 
                        Secretary.
                    ``(D) Guaranteed federal savings.--If the Secretary 
                determines that a Medicare Link contractor, after a 
                period of three consecutive years, does not maintain an 
                average net savings to the Medicare program of at least 
                5 percent per program enrollee as required under 
                subparagraph (A), the Medicare Link contractor shall 
                remit to the Secretary a sum specified by the Secretary 
                and related to the amount of the shortfall.
            ``(9) Savings validation audit.--The Secretary shall 
        provide for the annual auditing of the financial records 
        (including data relating to Medicare utilization and costs) of 
        organizations offering Medicare Link plans under this section
            ``(10) GAO audit.--Every 3 years the Comptroller General of 
        the United States shall conduct an audit of the Medicare Link 
        program costs and program savings. Such report shall be 
        submitted to the committees of the House of Representatives and 
        of the Senate with jurisdiction over Medicare.

        this section--

                and risk prioritization (described in paragraph (3)) 
                for individuals enrolled under the plan consistent with 
                this subsection;
                    ``(B) shall carry out the functions of medicare 
                administrative contractors described in paragraph 
                1874A(a)(4);
                    ``(C) shall provide a reduction or rebate in the 
                premium otherwise applicable under part B (as

Risk for Original Fee-for-Service Benefits.--

        provide for coverage of the same items and services that are

        outside of a Medicare Link plan.

                than the payment level otherwise applicable under part

                greater than the payment rates referred to in 
                subparagraph (A).

        contractor shall not be at financial risk with respect to the 
        coverage or payment for Medicare services covered under parts A 
        and B. But the Secretary may provide financial incentives for 
        contractors that are able to reduce Medicare expenditures for 
        such services below benchmark levels (specified by the 
        Secretary) that reasonably represent the levels of payments 
        that would be made (with respect to individuals enrolled under 
        a Medicare Link plan) if such individuals were not so 
        enrolled.''.
