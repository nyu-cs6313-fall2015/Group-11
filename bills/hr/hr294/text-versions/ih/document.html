    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

    Section 5.2(e) of Executive Order 13618, ``Assignment of National 
Security and Emergency Preparedness Communications Functions'' (July 6, 
2012; 77 Fed. Reg. 40779) is revoked to the extent that it refers to 
communications resources that are privately owned.

SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON FEDERAL USE AND CONTROL OF PRIVATELY OWNED

    No agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government may satisfy 
priority communications requirements (as such term is used in section 
5.2(e) of Executive Order 13618) through the use of privately owned 
communications resources, and no funds appropriated pursuant to any 
provision of law may be used to take any action that expands the 
authority of the Federal Government to control privately owned 
communications resources.
