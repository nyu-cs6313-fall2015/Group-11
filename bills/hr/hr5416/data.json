    "text": "War Powers Consultation Act of 2014 - States that: (1) the purpose of this Act is to establish a means by which the judgment of both the President and Congress can be brought to bear when deciding whether the United States should engage in a significant armed conflict; and (2) this Act is not meant to define, circumscribe, or enhance the constitutional war powers of either the executive or legislative branch of government.\n\nRepeals the War Powers Resolution.\n\nEstablishes the Joint Congressional Consultation Committee.\n\nDirects the President to consult with the Committee: (1) regularly regarding significant matters of foreign policy and national security; (2) before ordering the deployment of members of the Armed Forces into a significant armed conflict, particularly regarding the circumstances necessitating the conflict, the objectives, and the conflict's estimated scope and duration; and (3) at least every two months for the duration of any significant armed conflict.\n\nStates that, if the President determines that the need for secrecy or other emergency circumstances preclude carrying out such reporting before significant armed conflict is ordered or begins, the President shall do such reporting not later than three days after the beginning of the significant armed conflict.\n\nDeclares that, within 30 days after the deployment of members of the Armed Forces into a significant armed conflict for which Congress has not enacted a formal declaration of war or otherwise enacted a specific authorization for the use of military force, the chair and vice chair of the Committee shall introduce a joint resolution of approval. Sets forth related congressional procedures, including the introduction of a joint resolution of disapproval if a vote against a resolution of approval's passage has taken place.\n\nStates that nothing in this Act shall be construed as modifying U.S. obligations under any treaty or international agreement."
