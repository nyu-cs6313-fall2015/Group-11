                                 A BILL


 
   To authorize further assistance to Israel for the Iron Dome anti-
                        missile defense system.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Iron Dome Replenishment 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since June 12, 2014, the foreign terrorist organization 
        Hamas and other Palestinian extremists have been launching 
        dozens of rockets per day at the State of Israel.
            (2) Hamas possesses approximately 12,000 missiles of 
        assorted ranges that could threaten approximately 40 percent of 
        the Israeli population.
            (3) Iran has supplied Hamas and other Palestinian 
        extremists with long-range missiles, capable of hitting Israeli 
        population centers 100 miles away.
            (4) Hamas rockets are either unguided or have inaccurate 
        guidance systems, making them true weapons of terror designed 
        only to kill people at random.
            (5) Hamas has admitted targeting Israel's nuclear research 
        reactor at Dimona.
            (6) The use of rockets by Hamas against Israeli population 
        centers has been called a war crime.
            (7) In March 2014, Israel intercepted the ship Klos-C, 
        which was carrying dozens of long-range rockets, reportedly 
        from Iran to Hamas.
            (8) The United States remains committed to Israel's 
        qualitative military edge, including its advantage over Hamas 
        and other foreign terrorist organizations.
            (9) The Israeli Defense Forces report that the Iron Dome 
        anti-missile defense system has achieved a success rate of 90 
        percent, intercepting rockets bound for civilian population 
        centers, including residential neighborhoods, busy road 
        junctions, shopping centers, and crowded streets.
            (10) The recent success of the Iron Dome anti-missile 
        defense system averted massive Israeli casualties.
            (11) Supporting Israel's ability to defend itself against 
        missiles, rockets, and other threats advances the United States 
        own vital national security interests and the cause of Middle 
        Eastern peace and stability.
            (12) The White House said on July 8, 2014, ``No country can 
        accept rocket fire aimed at civilians and we support Israel's 
        right to defend itself against these vicious attacks.''.
            (13) In 2012, President Obama called Iron Dome ``critical 
        in terms of providing security and safety for Israeli families. 
        It is a program that has been tested and has prevented missile 
        strikes inside of Israel.''.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL FOR IRON DOME ANTI-
              MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.

    The President, acting through the Secretary of Defense and the 
Secretary of State, is authorized to provide assistance, upon request 
by the Government of Israel, for the procurement, maintenance, and 
sustainment of the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system for purposes 
of intercepting short-range missiles launched against Israel.
                                 <all>
