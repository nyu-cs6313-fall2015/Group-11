Deems the pay fairness requirement to be satisfied if: (1) the average compensation paid by the\u00a0employer for all applicable U.S. employees for the taxable year\u00a0exceeds the inflation and productivity growth adjusted average (i.e., $115,000 in 2014)\u00a0of such compensation\u00a0for the preceding taxable year; and (2) the aggregate compensation paid by the employer to or for all applicable employees for the taxable year\u00a0is not less than the aggregate of such compensation for the preceding taxable year."
