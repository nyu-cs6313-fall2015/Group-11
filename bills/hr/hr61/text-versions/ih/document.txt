the period of such assistance, the entity will not perform, and will 
not provide any funds to any other entity that performs, an abortion.
    ``(b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not apply with respect to an

            ``(2) a physician certifies that the woman suffers from a 
        physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that 
        would place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is 
        performed, including a life-threatening physical condition 
        caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.
    ``(c) Hospitals.--Subsection (a) does not apply with respect to a

assistance described in subsection (a), provide funds to any non-
hospital entity that performs an abortion (other than an abortion 
described in subsection (b)).
    ``(d) Annual Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the 
enactment of the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, and 
annually thereafter, for the fiscal year involved, the Secretary shall

                physician provides a certification described in 
                subsection (b)(2);
            ``(3) a statement of the date of the latest certification 
        under subsection (a) for each entity receiving a grant under 
        this title; and

        paragraph (1) makes available funds received through a grant 
        under this title.
    ``(e) Definitions.--In this section:

        including any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is 
        under common control with such entity.
            ``(2) The term `hospital' has the meaning given to such 
        term in section 1861(e) of the Social Security Act.''.
