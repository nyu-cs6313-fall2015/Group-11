        determines to be related to military sexual trauma.
            ``(3) The term `military sexual trauma' means, with respect 
        to a veteran, psychological trauma, which in the judgment of a 
        mental health professional, resulted from a physical assault of 
        a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual 
        harassment which occurred during active military, naval, or air 
        service.''.
            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the 
        beginning of such chapter is amended by adding at the end the

        of this Act. Such initial report shall be in addition to the 
        annual reports required under such section beginning in 
        December 2014.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs should update and improve the regulations 
of the Department of Veterans Affairs with respect to military sexual 
trauma by--
            (1) ensuring that military sexual trauma is specified as an 
        in-service stressor in determining the service-connection of 
        post-traumatic stress disorder by including military sexual 
        trauma as a stressor described in section 3.304(f)(3) of title 
        38, Code of Federal Regulations; and
            (2) recognizing the full range of physical and mental 
        disabilities (including depression, anxiety, and other 
        disabilities as indicated in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
        Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American 
        Psychiatric Association) that can result from military sexual 
        trauma.
    (c) Provision of Information.--During the period beginning on the 
date that is 15 months after the date of the enactment of this Act and 
ending on the date on which the Secretary updates and improves 
regulations as described in subsection (b), the Secretary shall--
            (1) provide to each veteran who has submitted a covered 
        claim or been treated for military sexual trauma at a medical 
        facility of the Department with a copy of the report under 
        subsection (a)(3) or section 1164 of title 38, United States 
        Code, as added by subsection (a)(1), that has most recently 
        been submitted to Congress;
            (2) provide on a monthly basis to each veteran who has 
        submitted any claim for disability compensation or been treated 
        at a medical facility of the Department information that 
        includes--
                    (A) the date that the Secretary plans to complete 
                such updates and improvements to such regulations;
                    (B) the number of covered claims that have been 
                granted or denied during the month covered by such 
                information;
                    (C) a comparison to such rate of grants and denials 
                with the rate for other claims regarding post-traumatic 
                stress disorder;
                    (D) the three most common reasons for such denials;
                    (E) the average time for completion of covered 
                claims;
                    (F) the average time for processing covered claims 
                at each regional office; and
                    (G) any information the Secretary determines 
                relevant with respect to submitting a covered claim;
            (3) in addition to providing to veterans the information 
        described in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall make available 
        on a monthly basis such information on a conspicuous location 
        of the Internet website of the Department; and
            (4) submit to Congress on a monthly basis a report that 
        includes--
                    (A) a list of all adjudicated covered claims, 
                including ancillary claims, during the month covered by 
                the report;
                    (B) the outcome with respect to each medical 
                condition included in the claim; and
                    (C) the reason given for any denial of such a 
                claim.
    (d) Military Sexual Trauma Defined.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``covered claim'' has the meaning given that 
        term in section 1164(c)(1) of title 38, United States Code, as 
        added by subsection (a)(1).
            (2) The term ``military sexual trauma'' has the meaning 
        given that term in section 1164(c)(3) of title 38, United 
        States Code, as added by subsection (a)(1).
