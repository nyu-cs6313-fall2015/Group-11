addition to any other provided by law. The fact that the person was 
separated from the armed forces under other than honorable conditions

force in which the person last served. The service of the person in the 
armed forces shall be proved by duly authenticated copies of the 
service records of the person.
    ``(3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to alter the
