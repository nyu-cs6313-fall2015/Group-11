_______________________________________________________________________


                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                              June 5, 2013

Mr. Amash (for himself, Mr. McClintock, and Mr. Massie) introduced the

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To abolish the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Export-Import Bank Termination 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Export subsidies provide advantages to specific 
        industries or businesses at the expense of their domestic 
        competition, other sectors of the United States economy, and 
        the public at large.
            (2) Banks and other financial institutions that provide 
        trade facilitation credit also profit from export subsidies 
        such as loan guarantees and trade insurance.
            (3) International trade finance is well developed and 
        supplied by the private sector at competitive rates that 
        reflect market conditions.
            (4) The Export-Import Bank of the United States is an 
        agency of the United States Government that subsidizes exports 
        by insuring or guaranteeing trade facilitation loans and other 
        credit from private financial institutions and by providing 
        direct loans to United States exporters.
            (5) Export subsidies impose risks on United States 
        taxpayers. In a June 2012 paper using accurate, fair value 
        estimation, the Congressional Budget Office found that the 
        expected return of the Export-Import Bank of the United States 
        was less than a tenth of the estimate under the current, flawed 
        methodology used pursuant to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 
        1990.
            (6) Recent years have revealed other ``safe'' Federal 
        credit programs to have large taxpayer costs, for example, 
        Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the Federal Housing 
        Administration.
            (7) The Export-Import Bank of the United States claims to 
        serve small businesses primarily, but most of its financing 
        subsidizes exports of large multinational corporations.

SEC. 3. REDUCTIONS OF AUTHORITIES BEFORE ABOLISHMENT.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law:
            (1) Termination of authority to accept applications for 
        assistance.--The Export-Import Bank of the United States (in 
        this Act referred to as the ``Bank'') may not accept an 
        application for a loan, insurance, or a guarantee, or to 
        participate in an extension of credit by another entity, after 
        the 30-day period that begins with the date of the enactment of 
        this Act.
            (2) Termination of authority to renew or enter into a 
        contract for the provision of assistance by the bank.--The Bank 
        may not renew or enter into a contract which would obligate the 
        Bank to provide a loan, insurance, or a guarantee, or 
        participate in an extension of credit by another entity, after 
        the 12-month period that begins with such date of enactment.
