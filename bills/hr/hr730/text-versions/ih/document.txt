    This Act may be cited as the ``Pest Elimination Services 
Transparency and Terminology Act'' or the ``PESTT Act''.

SEC. 2. URBAN RODENT CONTROL DEFINED.

    Title I of the Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act, 1988 (Public Law 100-202; 101 Stat. 1329-331) is 
amended in the last proviso under the heading ``animal and plant health 
inspection service--salaries and expenses'' (7 U.S.C. 426c), by 
striking ``Animal Damage Control activities'' at the end and inserting 
``Animal Damage Control activities, and the term `urban rodent control' 
means efforts to directly control any mammal in the order Rodentia in a 
location that is not an airport or in a rural area (as defined in 
section 520 of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. 1490))''.

SEC. 3. REPORT ON ACTIVITIES OF WILDLIFE SERVICES PROGRAM OF THE ANIMAL 
              AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE.

    Not later than October 1, 2013, the Comptroller General of the 
United States shall submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry of the Senate a report that--
            (1) identifies activities carried out by the Wildlife 
        Services program of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
        Service that can be carried out by entities with appropriate 
        expertise and capacity in the private sector;
            (2) prioritizes the activities conducted by the Wildlife 
        Services program that--
                    (A) are vital to the protection of public health 
                and safety and agricultural production; and
                    (B) can be performed by the entities referred to in 
                paragraph (1); and
            (3) recommends ways, including any necessary changes to 
        Federal statutes, to avoid duplicative work being conducted by 
        the Wildlife Services program and the private sector.
                                 <all>
