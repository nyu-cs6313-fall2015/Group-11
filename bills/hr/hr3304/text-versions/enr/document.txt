    improve the sustainment of the tactical vehicle industrial base, 
    and reduce risk during this downturn in defense procurement.
    (b) Study Required.--
        (1) Study.--The Secretary of the Army, in consultation with the 
    Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and 
    Logistics, shall conduct a study of the desirability and

        increases in cost, savings, or risk that may derive from such a 
        contract in comparison to standard contracting methods.
            (B) An evaluation of whether the Secretary requires 
        legislative action to enter into such a multiyear, multivehicle 
        contract.
            (C) Any other matters the Secretary determines appropriate.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans 
    Affairs have failed to implement a solution that allows for 
    seamless electronic sharing of medical health care data; and
        (2) despite the significant amount of read-only information 
    shared between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans 
    Affairs, most of the information shared as of the date of the 
    enactment of this Act is not standardized or available in real time 
    to support all clinical decisions.
    (b) Implementation.--The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs--
        (1) shall each ensure that the electronic health record systems 
    of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs

        (2) Transition the current data exchanges between the 
    Departments and private sector health care providers where 
    practical to modern, open-architecture frameworks that use 
    computable data mapped to national standards to make data available 
    for determining medical trends and for enhanced clinician decision 
    support.
        (3) Principles with respect to open architecture standards, 
    including--
            (A) adoption of national data standards;
            (B) if such national standards do not exist as of the date 
        on which the record is being established, adoption of the 
        articulation of data of the Health Data Dictionary until such 
        national standards are established;
            (C) use of enterprise investment strategies that maximize 
        the use of commercial best practices to ensure robust 
        competition and best value;

            (F) strategies for data management rights to ensure a level 
        competitive playing field and access to alternative solutions 
        and sources across the life-cycle of the programs.
        (4) By the point of deployment, such record must be at a 
    generation 3 level or better for a health information technology 
    system.
        (5) To the extent the Secretaries consider feasible and 
    advisable, principles with respect to--
            (A) the creation of a health data authoritative source by

    pay, annuity, or award to which the employee is otherwise entitled 
    or for which the employee is otherwise eligible or limit the amount 
    thereof except that the monetary value of an award for the same 
    project or effort shall be deducted from the amount otherwise 
    available under this paragraph. Payments, determined under the 
    terms of this paragraph and made to an employee developer as such, 
    may continue after the developer leaves the DOD laboratory or the

            management systems.
                (v) Records management for hiring and clearance 
            decisions.
            (B) Elimination or reduction, where possible, of the use of 
        databases and information sources that cannot be accessed and 
        processed automatically electronically, or modification of such 
        databases and information sources, if appropriate and cost-
        effective, to enable electronic access and processing.
            (C) Access and analysis of government, publically 
        available, and commercial data sources, including social media, 
        that provide independent information pertinent to adjudication

        timeliness, and reduce costs, of investigations and 
        reinvestigations.
            (D) Use of government-developed and commercial technology 
        for continuous monitoring and evaluation of government and 
        commercial data sources that can identify and flag information 
        pertinent to hiring and clearance determinations.
            (E) Standardization of forms used for routine reporting 
        required of cleared personnel (such as travel, foreign 
        contacts, and financial disclosures) and use of continuous 
        monitoring technology to access databases containing such 
        reportable information to independently obtain and analyze 
        reportable data and events.
            (F) Establishment of an authoritative central repository of 
        personnel security information that is accessible 
        electronically at multiple levels of classification and 
        eliminates technical barriers to rapid access to information 
        necessary for eligibility determinations and reciprocal 
        recognition thereof, including the ability to monitor the 
        status of an individual and any events related to the continued 
        eligibility of such individual for employment or clearance 
        during intervals between investigations.
            (G) Elimination or reduction of the scope of, or alteration 
        of the schedule for, periodic reinvestigations of cleared 
        personnel, when such action is appropriate in light of the 
        information provided by continuous monitoring or evaluation 
        technology.
            (H) Electronic integration of personnel security processes 
        and information systems with insider threat detection and 
        monitoring systems, and pertinent law enforcement, 
        counterintelligence and intelligence information, for threat 
        detection and correlation, including those processes and

    (1) shall--
            (A) include the development of a risk-based approach to 
        monitoring and reinvestigation that prioritizes which cleared 
        individuals shall be subject to frequent reinvestigations and 
        random checks, such as the personnel with the broadest access 
        to classified information or with access to the most sensitive 
        classified information, including information technology 
        specialists or other individuals with such broad access 
        commonly known as ``super users'';
            (B) ensure that if the system of continuous monitoring for 
        all cleared individuals described in paragraph (4)(D) is 
        implemented in phases, such system shall be implemented on a 
        priority basis for the individuals prioritized under 
        subparagraph (A); and

        security clearances in granting reciprocity for security 
        clearances, and the manner in which such differences can be 
        harmonized.
            (B) The extent to which existing Federal Investigative 
        Standards are relevant, complete, and sufficient for guiding 
        agencies and individual investigators as they conduct their 
        security clearance background investigations.
            (C) The processes agencies have implemented to ensure 
        quality in the security clearance background investigation 
        process.
            (D) The extent to which agencies have developed and 
        implemented outcome-focused performance measures to track the 
        quality of security clearance investigations and any insights 
        from these measures.

    programming, budgeting, and execution challenges to such 
    approaches, including methods to address potential termination 
    liability or cancellation costs generally associated with multi-
    year contracts;
        (4) an identification of any changes needed in the requirements 
    development and approval processes of the Department of Defense to 
    facilitate effective and efficient implementation of such strategy, 
    including an identification of any consolidation of requirements 
    for such services across the Department that may achieve increased 
    buying power and efficiency; and
        (5) an identification of any necessary changes to policies, 
    procedures, regulations, or statutes.
    (d) Briefings.--
        (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the

    control systems, policies, and technical possibilities of future 
    systems;
        (2) an identification of any gaps or risks in existing space 
    control system architecture and possibilities for improvement or 
    mitigation of such gaps or risks;
        (3) a description of existing and future sensor coverage and 
    ground processing capabilities for space situational awareness;
        (4) an explanation of the extent to which all relevant and 
    available information is being utilized for space situational 
    awareness to detect, track, and identify objects in space;
        (5) a description of existing space situational awareness data 
    sharing practices, including what information is being shared and 
    what the benefits and risks of such sharing are to the national

        States Armed Forces and United States allies from limited

    robust strategic defensive capabilities as undermining the overall 
    strategic balance, and stands ready to cooperate with the Russian 
    Federation on strategic defensive capabilities, as long as such 
    cooperation is aimed at fostering and in no way constrains the 
    defensive capabilities of both sides'';
        (3) any missile defense cooperation with the Russian Federation 
    should not in any way limit United States' or NATO's missile 
    defense capabilities, and should be mutually beneficial and

SEC. 1751. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COMMANDING OFFICER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
COMMAND CLIMATE FREE OF RETALIATION.
    It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) commanding officers in the Armed Forces are responsible for 
    establishing a command climate in which sexual assault allegations 
    are properly managed and fairly evaluated and in which a victim can 
    report criminal activity, including sexual assault, without fear of 
    retaliation, including ostracism and group pressure from other 
    members of the command;
        (2) the failure of commanding officers to maintain such a 
    command climate is an appropriate basis for relief from their 
    command positions; and
        (3) senior officers should evaluate subordinate commanding 
    officers on their performance in establishing a command climate as 
    described in paragraph (1) during the regular periodic counseling 
    and performance appraisal process prescribed by the Armed Force 
    concerned for inclusion in the systems of records maintained and 
    used for assignment and promotion selection boards.

CERTAIN SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OFFENSES UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY 
JUSTICE THROUGH COURTS-MARTIAL.
    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) any charge regarding an offense specified in subsection (b) 
    should be disposed of by court-martial, rather than by non-judicial 
    punishment or administrative action; and
        (2) in the case of any charge regarding an offense specified in 
    subsection (b) that is disposed of by non-judicial punishment or 
    administrative action, rather than by court-martial, the 
    disposition authority should include in the case file a 
    justification for the disposition of the charge by non-judicial 
    punishment or administrative action, rather than by court-martial.
    (b) Covered Offenses.--An offense specified in this subsection is 
any of the following offenses under chapter 47 of title 10, United 
States Code (the Uniform Code of Military Justice):
        (1) Rape or sexual assault under subsection (a) or (b) of 
    section 920 of such title (article 120 of the Uniform Code of 
    Military Justice).
        (2) Forcible sodomy under section 925 of such title (article 
    125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice).
        (3) An attempt to commit an offense specified in paragraph (1) 
    or (2), as punishable under section 880 of such title (article 80 
    of the Uniform Code of Military Justice).
SEC. 1753. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DISCHARGE IN LIEU OF COURT-MARTIAL 
OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO COMMIT SEX-RELATED OFFENSES.
    It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the Armed Forces should be exceedingly sparing in 
    discharging in lieu of court-martial members of the Armed Forces 
    who have committed rape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy, or 
    attempts to commit such offenses, and should do so only when the 
    facts of the case clearly warrant such discharge;
        (2) whenever possible, the victims of offenses referred to in 
    paragraph (1) shall be consulted prior to the determination 
    regarding whether to discharge the members who committed such 
    offenses;
        (3) convening authorities should consider the views of victims 
    of offenses referred to in paragraph (1) when determining whether 
    to discharge the members who committed such offenses in lieu of 
    trying such members by court-martial; and
        (4) the discharge of any member who is discharged as described 
    in paragraph (1) should be characterized as Other Than Honorable.

SEC. 3147. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON B61-12 LIFE EXTENSION PROGRAM.
    It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the B61-12 life extension program must be a high priority 
    of the National Nuclear Security Administration;
        (2) the B61-12 life extension program must be given top 
    priority in the budget of the Administration and, if necessary, 
    funding should be shifted from other programs of the Administration 
    to ensure that the B61-12 life extension program stays on schedule 
    to begin delivering B61-12 nuclear bombs to the military by not 
    later than fiscal year 2020; and
        (3) further delays to the B61-12 life extension program would

    United States.

302, to--

    the Department of Labor site exposure matrix;
        (2) conduct periodic peer reviews of, and approve, medical 
    guidance for part E claims examiners with respect to the weighing 
    of a claimant's medical evidence;
        (3) obtain periodic expert review of evidentiary requirements 
    for part B claims related to lung disease regardless of approval;
        (4) provide oversight over industrial hygienists, Department of 
    Labor staff physicians, and Department of Labor's consulting 
    physicians and their reports to ensure quality, objectivity, and 
    consistency; and
        (5) coordinate exchanges of data and findings with the Advisory 
    Board on Radiation and Worker Health (under section 3624 the Energy 
    Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 
    U.S.C. 7384o)) to the extent necessary.

SEC. 3503. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) It is in the interest of United States national security 
    that the United States merchant marine, both ships and mariners, 
    serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war or national emergency.
        (2) The readiness of the United States merchant fleet should be 
    augmented by a Government-owned reserve fleet comprised of ships 
    with national defense features that may not be available 
    immediately in sufficient numbers or types in the active United 
    States-owned, United States-flagged, and United States-crewed 
    commercial industry.
        (3) The Ready Reserve Force of the Maritime Administration, a 
    component of the National Defense Reserve Fleet, plays an important 
    role in United States national security by providing necessary 
    readiness and efficiency in the form of a Government-owned sealift 
    fleet.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) maintaining a United States shipbuilding base is critical 
    to meeting United States national security requirements;
        (2) it is of vital importance that the Ready Reserve Force of 
    the Maritime Administration remains capable, modern, and efficient 
    in order to best serve the national security needs of the United 
    States in times of war or national emergency;
        (3) Federal agencies must consider investment options for 
    replacing aging vessels within the Ready Reserve Force to meet 
    future operational commitments;
        (4) investment in recapitalizing the Ready Reserve Force may 
    include--
            (A) construction of dual-use vessels, based on need, for 
        use in the America's Marine Highway Program of the Department 
        of Transportation, as a recent study performed under a 
        cooperative agreement between the Maritime Administration and 
        the Navy demonstrated that dual-use vessels transporting 
        domestic freight between United States ports could be called 
        upon to supplement sealift capacity;
            (B) construction of tanker vessels to meet military 
        transport needs; and
            (C) construction of vessels for use in transporting 
        potential new energy exports; and
        (5) the Department of Transportation, in consultation with the 
    Navy, should pursue the most cost-effective means of recapitalizing 
    the Ready Reserve Force, including by promoting the building of new 
    vessels that are militarily useful and commercially viable.

        (1) In general.--Under the port infrastructure development

    States Code, the Maritime Administrator, in consultation with the 
    Secretary of Defense, may give priority to providing funding to 
    strategic seaports in support of national security requirements.
        (2) Strategic seaport defined.--In this subsection the term 
    ``strategic seaport'' means a military port or and commercial port 
    that is subject to a port planning order or Basic Ordering 
    Agreement (or both) that is projected to be used for the deployment 
    of forces and shipment of ammunition or sustainment supplies in 
    support of military operations.
    (b) Financial Assistance.--Section 50302(c)(2)(D) of title 46,
