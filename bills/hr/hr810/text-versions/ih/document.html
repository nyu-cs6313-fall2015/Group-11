United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On September 14, 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert M. 
        Gates outlined an efficiencies initiative relating to 
        contracting for goods and services by the Department of 
        Defense, designed to save the Department $100 billion over the 
        next five years.
            (2) On January 26, 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta 
        announced that the Department of Defense was on the path to 
        save $259 billion over the next 5 years and $487 billion over 
        the next 10. Secretary Panetta called the budget ``a balanced, 
        complete package'' that keeps the American military the 
        preeminent force in the world.
            (3) On February 13, 2012, Assistant Secretary of Defense 
        Ashton Carter, along with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified 
        to the House Armed Services Committee that, if limitations on 
        the transfer of funds were lifted in the Continuing 
        Appropriations Resolution (Public Law 112-175), significant 
        shortfalls in the Operations & Maintenance accounts of their 
        respective services could be alleviated.
