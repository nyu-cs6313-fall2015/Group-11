    (a) Competitive Grants Authorized.--
            (1) Authorization and primary purpose.--The Secretary of 
        the Air Force may make a grant, on a competitive basis, to an 
        existing biofuels research center in the United States to 
        conduct pilot-scale research, development, and testing of bio-
        based fuels that are suitable for use by the Air Force as an 
        aviation fuel for jet aircraft.
            (2) Additional purposes.--Grant funds provided under 
        paragraph (1) may also be used by the grant recipient to train 
        military and civilian personnel in the new technologies and to 
        conduct a study regarding the economic feasibility of a full-
        scale bio-based aviation fuel production facility.
    (b) Grant Applications and Selection.--
            (1) In general.--Grant applicants shall submit an 
        application to the Secretary of the Air Force at such time, in 
        such manner, and accompanied by such information as the

            (2) Selection preference.--In conducting the competition 
        for selection of the grant recipient, the Secretary shall give 
        a preference to an existing biofuels research center in the 
        United States that--
                    (A) has the capacity and expertise necessary to 
                quickly and efficiently conduct the pilot-scale 
                research, development, and testing described in 
                subsection (a)(1); and

                        responsibility for military air transportation; 
                        and
                            (iii) a private or commercial airport with 
                        capacity to host a research and pilot 
                        production facility.
    (c) Grant Amounts.--Grants under subsection (a) may not exceed a 
total $25,000,000. With the approval of the Secretary of the Air Force, 
grant funds may be used for infrastructure to facilitate the pilot-
scale research, development, and testing described in subsection 
(a)(1).
