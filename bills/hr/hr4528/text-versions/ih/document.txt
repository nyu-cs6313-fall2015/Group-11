To require a report and briefing to Congress explaining the procurement 
   and inspection process for armored vehicles to transport civilian 
                employees of the Department of Defense.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. REPORT AND BRIEFING TO CONGRESS EXPLAINING THE PROCUREMENT 
              AND INSPECTION PROCESS FOR ARMORED VEHICLES TO TRANSPORT 
              CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) civilian employees of the Department of Defense should 
        be provided all reasonable protection while in hostile foreign 
        areas, and that protection should include adequate armored 
        vehicle transportation; and
            (2) to ensure adequate protection, the Department of 
        Defense should employ stringent, uniform standards while 
        procuring armored vehicles for civilians to be used overseas as 
        well as stringent standards for inspection upon delivery.
    (b) Report Required.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with the Under 
Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, shall 
submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the 
Department's policies for procuring and inspecting armored vehicles for 
transporting civilian employees. Such report should include the 
following:
            (1) An explanation of what the Department's current 
        policies are for procuring and inspecting armored vehicles for 
        transporting civilians through hostile or potentially hostile 
        territory.
            (2) A comparison of the policies outlined in paragraph (1) 
        with other departments, and specifically the Department of 
        State.
            (3) An evaluation by the Secretary to determine whether 
        changes to the policies outlined in paragraph (1) would be 
        beneficial in enhancing safety for the civilians described in 
        paragraph (1).
            (4) Any other matters the Secretary determines appropriate.
    (c) Briefing Required.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with the 
Under Secretary of Defense of Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, 
shall provide to the congressional defense committees a detailed 
briefing on the report required in subsection (b).
