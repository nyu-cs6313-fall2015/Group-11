Applies specified penalties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for violations of this Act.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to waive the application of a prohibition for up to 180 days (with renewable 180-day waivers) if in U.S. national security interests, and with congressional notification.\n\nDirects the Secretary to identify to Congress every 180 days each foreign central bank that carries out a prohibited activity.\n\nDirects the President to transmit to Congress a list of, and impose specified sanctions against, any person who knowingly engages in a transaction with a foreign person that transfers or receives, or facilitates the transfer or receipt of, any goods or services to or from ISIS.\n\nStates that the President shall not be required to include a person on this list if: (1) that person is no longer engaging in or has taken significant steps toward stopping sanctioned activities, and (2) the President has received reliable assurances that such person will not knowingly engage in any new sanctioned activity.\n\nStates that nothing in this Act shall apply to authorized U.S. intelligence activities."
