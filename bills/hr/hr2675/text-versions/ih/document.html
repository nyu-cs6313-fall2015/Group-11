appropriate calendar of the House involved.
    (d) Expedited Consideration.--
            (1) Consideration.--On or after the third day after the 
        date on which the committee to which a Commission bill 
        described in subsection (a)(1) is referred has reported, or has

        motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited 
        to not more than 2 hours, which shall be divided equally

        postpone, a motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
        business, or a motion to recommit the bill is not in order. A 
        motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill is agreed to or 
        disagreed to is not in order.
            (3) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the 
        conclusion of the debate on the bill and a single quorum call 
        at the conclusion of the debate, if requested in accordance 
        with the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final 
        passage of the bill shall occur.
            (4) Appeals.--Appeals from the decisions of the Chair 
        relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the 
        House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure 
        relating to the bill shall be decided without debate.
    (e) Consideration by Other House.--
            (1) Before passage.--If, before the passage by one House of 
        a Commission bill of that House described in subsection (a)(1),

                not be referred to a committee and may not be 
                considered in the House receiving it except in the case 
                of vote on final passage as provided in subparagraph 
                (B); and
                    (B) with respect to a Commission bill of the House 
                receiving the bill, the procedure in that House shall 
                be the same as if no bill had been received from the 
                other House, but the vote on final passage shall be on 
                the bill of the other House.
            (2) After passage.--Upon disposition of a Commission bill 
        received from the other House, it shall no longer be in order

        only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House 
        in the case of a Commission bill described in subsection 
        (a)(1), and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that 
        it is inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules of procedure of that House at
