Directs the Administrator to establish criteria for designation of an EBE, including:\n\n a maximum number of employees determined according to a certain formula, an age of not more than five years, and a specified salary limitation for any individual who owns any part of the small business or who is in a management position. Requires the head of each federal agency to establish goals for participation by the designated EBEs in at least 5% of all contracts, including prime contracts and subcontracts, for each fiscal year.\n\nAuthorizes the Administrator to make a loan to a designated EBE under the SBA Express Loan Program, but only in accordance with specified terms.\n\nRequires the Administrator, by rule, to establish a process for initial self-certification of EBEs for purposes of participation in federal contracts and eligibility for the Express Loans."
