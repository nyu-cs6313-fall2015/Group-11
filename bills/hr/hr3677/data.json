Expands the scope of covered energy under such program.\n\n Expresses the sense of Congress that open dialogue and continued mechanisms for regular engagement encourages further U.S.-Israel public, academic, and private cooperation on energy security issues.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of State to seek to establish an Energy Cooperation Working Group within the semi-annual United States-Israel Strategic Dialogue.\n\nStates that the Group's purpose shall be to strengthen U.S.-Israel dialogue on: (1) advancing research, development, and deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency; (2) identifying policy priorities associated with Israel's natural resources development; (3) identifying best practices for energy infrastructure cyber security; (4) leveraging natural gas resources to impact regional stability positively; (5) developing technical and environmental management of deep-water exploration and production; and (6) implementing coastal protection and restoration."
