                           February 13, 2013

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
      To amend the Public Health Service Act to create a National 
   Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium to provide grants and coordinate 
  research with respect to the causes of, and risk factors associated 
          with, neuromyelitis optica, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Neuromyelitis Optica Consortium 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a devastating neurologic 
        disease leading to blindness and paralysis.
            (2) There are an estimated 11,000 patients with NMO in the 
        United States.
            (3) Women are affected 7 to 9 times more than men, and a 
        large proportion of NMO patients are African-American.
            (4) The average age at diagnosis is 41 years, but the range 
        is broad and includes children as young as 2 years of age and 
        adults as old as 89 years of age.
            (5) NMO incurs substantial costs for affected patients and 
        their families.
            (6) The cause of NMO is unknown, but it is hypothesized to 
        be autoimmune in nature.
            (7) More than 90 percent of NMO patients will suffer 
        recurrent disease and accumulate neurologic disability.
            (8) Because of their relatively low overall incidence, 
        orphan diseases like NMO frequently do not receive sufficient 
        attention and research funding.
            (9) No single institution has a sufficient number of 
        patients to independently conduct research that will adequately 
        address the cause of NMO.
            (10) There has been no comprehensive study analyzing all 
        relevant clinical, biological, and epidemiological aspects of 
        NMO to identify potential risk factors and biomarkers for NMO.
            (11) We can apply our understanding of NMO to the study of 
        other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and 
        systemic lupus erythematosus.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that there is a need--
            (1) to establish and coordinate a multicenter research 
        effort based on collaboration between regional consortia and 
        governmental and nongovernmental entities in order to--
                    (A) comprehensively study the causes of NMO; and
                    (B) identify potential biomarkers of disease 
                activity; and
            (2) to encourage a collaborative effort among academic 
        medical centers with epidemiological study groups to gather 
        comprehensive and detailed information for each patient 
        enrolled in those groups, in order to investigate 
        environmental, nutritional, and genetic factors with respect 
        to, and the pathological and epidemiological characteristics 
        of, NMO.

SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL NEUROMYELITIS OPTICA CONSORTIUM.

    Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 
et seq.) is amended by adding after section 409J the following new 
section:
