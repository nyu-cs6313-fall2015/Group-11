                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to improve the operations of 
      the Election Assistance Commission, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``EAC Improvements 
Act of 2013''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The elections for Federal office which were held in 
        November 2012 were plagued with a number of serious problems, 
        including--
                    (A) long lines at polling places;
                    (B) poll workers who were trained inadequately;
                    (C) the reduction of hours for early voting; and
                    (D) the imposition of practices which restricted 
                eligible individuals from voting, such as requirements 
                to produce photo identification.
            (2) At the time these problems were developing, the 
        Election Assistance Commission, an agency of the Federal 
        Government which was established to assist the States in the 
        administration of elections, lacked a quorum in its membership 
        and therefore could not meet, appoint an executive director or 
        general counsel, or otherwise take any actions to prevent these 
        problems from occurring.
            (3) The inability of the Commission to carry out its duties 
        meant that it could not convene its Standards Board, a 
        collection of State and local election officials with the 
        authority to review guidelines for the voluntary standards 
        applicable to the voting systems used to administer these 
        elections and to make recommendations for best practices for 
        election administration.
            (4) The inability of the Commission to carry out its duties 
        meant that no new laboratories could be certified to develop 
        and test the equipment used in these elections.
            (5) The Election Assistance Commission should be allowed to 
        investigate fully the problems which plagued the elections held 
        in November 2012 and to develop solutions.
            (6) The Election Assistance Commission should be given the 
        tools it needs to carry out its mission in a manner immune from 
        illogic and partisan bickering, so that it can provide States 
        and others involved in the administration of elections with the 
        guidance that will enable them to provide each citizen who 
        wishes to participate in the electoral process the ability to 
        do so.
            (7) The Election Assistance Commission should be permitted 
        to provide to taxpayers and election officials accurate 
        information on the voting equipment used to administer 
        elections and to hold the vendors of such equipment accountable 
        for any problems that may arise with its use.

SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF COMMISSION.

    (a) Reauthorization.--Section 210 of the Help America Vote Act of 
2002 (42 U.S.C. 15330) is amended by striking ``for each of the fiscal 
years 2003 through 2005'' and inserting ``for each of the fiscal years 
2014 through 2018''.
    (b) Treatment of Commission in Same Manner as Federal Election 
Commission for Purposes of Paperwork Reduction Act.--Section 3502(1) of 
title 44, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) as 
        subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E); and
            (2) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new 
        subparagraph:
                    ``(B) the Election Assistance Commission;''.

SEC. 3. REQUIRING STATES TO PARTICIPATE IN POST-GENERAL ELECTION 
              SURVEYS.

    (a) Requirement.--Title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 
(42 U.S.C. 15481 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 303 the 
following new section:

``SEC. 303A. REQUIRING PARTICIPATION IN POST-GENERAL ELECTION SURVEYS.

    ``(a) Requirement.--Each State shall furnish to the Commission such 
information as the Commission may request for purposes of conducting 
any post-election survey of the States with respect to the 
administration of a regularly scheduled general election for Federal 
office.
    ``(b) Effective Date.--This section shall apply with respect to the 
regularly scheduled general election for Federal office held in 
November 2014 and any succeeding election.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment Relating to Enforcement.--Section 401 of 
such Act (42 U.S.C. 15511) is amended by striking ``and 303'' and 
inserting ``303, and 303A''.
    (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of such Act is 
amended by inserting after the item relating to section 303 the 
following new item:

``Sec. 303A. Requiring participation in post-general election 
                            surveys.''.

SEC. 4. DETERMINING EXTENT TO WHICH DISABLED INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO 
              POLLING PLACES.

    (a) Ongoing Surveys of Compliance With ADA.--In accordance with 
section 241 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 15381), not 
later than 180 days after the date of the regularly scheduled general 
election for Federal office held in November 2014 and each succeeding 
regularly scheduled general election for Federal office, the Election 
Assistance Commission, shall, with the assistance of the Comptroller 
General, conduct and publish a survey of each polling place used for 
the election to determine the percentage of such polling places that 
were in compliance with the standards applicable to such locations 
under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990.
    (b) Evaluation of Need To Continue Surveys.--At the time the 
Election Assistance Commission publishes the results of the survey 
conducted under subsection (a) with respect to the regularly scheduled 
general election for Federal office held in November 2022, the 
Commission shall evaluate and make a recommendation to Congress 
regarding whether the percentage of polling places in compliance with 
the standards applicable to such locations under the Americans With 
Disabilities Act of 1990 has increased to such an extent that there is 
no longer a need to conduct surveys under subsection (a) with respect 
to subsequent elections.

              TESTING OF VOTING EQUIPMENT HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE;

                as the exclusive source for making payments to 
                accredited laboratories for the costs of the testing 
                carried out in connection with the certification,

                expected to be incurred by the accredited laboratories

                            ``(ii) the request provides sufficient 
                        information for the Commission to determine the

shall include in the study conducted under this section such 
recommendations as the Commission shall consider appropriate to reduce 
the costs incurred by States and units of local government in
