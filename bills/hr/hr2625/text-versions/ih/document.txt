                                 A BILL


 
                   To protect the rights of children.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Student Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds:
            (1) So-called ``zero-tolerance'' weapons policies in 
        federally funded schools are being used to outlaw harmless 
        expressions of childhood play.
            (2) So-called ``zero-tolerance'' weapons policies in 
        federally funded schools are being used to teach children to be 
        afraid of inanimate objects that are shaped like guns.
            (3) A school in Grand Island, Nebraska, this year demanded 
        a three-year-old deaf boy in preschool change his name because 
        its sign language expression resembles a gun.
            (4) A seven-year-old Colorado boy was suspended for 
        throwing an imaginary hand grenade.
            (5) In Talbot County, Maryland, two six-year-old boys were 
        suspended this year for shaping their fingers in the shape of 
        guns while playing ``cops and robbers'' during recess.
            (6) A 14-year-old in Kentucky was not only suspended from 
        school this year for wearing an NRA T-shirt that said, 
        ``protect your right'', but the principal called police to have 
        him arrested.
            (7) A six-year-old Palmer, Massachusetts, kindergartner who 
        brought a plastic G.I. Joe Lego toy gun on a school bus was 
        given detention and ordered to write a letter of apology to the 
        bus driver and fellow student passengers.
            (8) This government-sanctioned political correctness is 
        traumatizing children and spreading irrational fear.

SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    (a) No funds appropriated pursuant to any provisions of law may be 
used for any educational institution which punishes a student as a 
result of any of the following actions by the student:
            (1) brandishing a pastry or other food which is partially 
        consumed in such a way that the remnant resembles a gun;
            (2) possession of a toy gun which is two inches or less;
            (3) possession of a toy gun made of plastic snap together 
        building blocks;

            (5) vocalizing imaginary firearms or munitions;
            (6) wearing a T-shirt that supports Second Amendment 
        rights;
            (7) drawing a picture of, or possessing an image of, a 
        firearm; or
            (8) using a pencil, pen or other writing utensil to 
        simulate a firearm.
    (b) Effective Date.--The provisions of this Act shall take effect 
on the date of enactment of the Act.
                                 <all>
