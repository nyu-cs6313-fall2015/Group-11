Taxpayer Bailout Protection Act - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, with respect to the program of risk corridors (under which a qualified health plan offered in the individual or small group market is required to participate in a payment adjustment system based on the ratio of the allowable costs of the plan to the plan's aggregate premiums), to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to ensure that the amount of payments to plans for a plan year beginning during calendar years 2014 through 2016 does not exceed the amount of payments to the Secretary for such plan year.

Requires the Secretary to proportionately decrease the amount of payments to plans in order to ensure that such requirement is satisfied each year.</summary>
