                                 A BILL


 
      To establish the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Frederick Douglass Bicentennial 
Commission Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in 
        1818 and given the name Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey 
        after his mother Harriet Bailey, Frederick Douglass has been 
        called the father of the civil rights movement.
            (2) Douglass rose through determination, brilliance, and 
        eloquence to shape the American Nation. He was an abolitionist, 
        human rights and women's rights activist, orator, author, 
        journalist, publisher, and social reformer.
            (3) Taught basic reading skills by his mistress until she 
        was forced to stop, Douglass continued to teach himself to read 
        and write and taught other slaves to read despite risks 
        including death.
            (4) During the course of his remarkable life Frederick 
        Douglass escaped from slavery, became internationally renowned 
        for his eloquence in the cause of liberty, and went on to serve 
        the national government in several official capacities.
            (5) Forced to leave the country to avoid arrest as an 
        escaped slave, he returned to become a staunch advocate of the 
        Union cause and helped recruit African-American troops for the 
        Union Army, including two of his sons, Charles and Lewis 
        Douglass. His personal relationship with Abraham Lincoln helped 
        persuade the President to make emancipation a cause of the 
        Civil War.
            (6) With the abolition of slavery at the close of the Civil 
        War, Douglass then turned his attention to the full integration 
        of African-Americans into the political and economic life of 
        the United States. Committed to freedom, Douglass dedicated his 
        life to achieving justice for all Americans, in particular 
        African-Americans, women, and minority groups. He envisioned 
        America as an inclusive Nation strengthened by diversity and 
        free of discrimination.
            (7) Douglass served as an advisor to Presidents. Abraham 
        Lincoln referred to him as the most meritorious man of the 
        nineteenth century. Douglass was appointed to several offices. 
        He served as the United States Marshal of the District of 
        Columbia under Rutherford B. Hayes' administration; President 
        James Garfield appointed Douglass the District of Columbia 
        Recorder of Deeds. In 1889, President Benjamin Harrison 
        appointed Frederick Douglass to be the United States minister 
        to Haiti. He was also appointed by President Grant to serve as 
        Assistant Secretary of the Commission of Inquiry to Santo 
        Domingo.
            (8) Douglass lived in the District of Columbia for 23 of 
        his 57 years as a free man, and in recognition of his 
        leadership and continuous fight for justice and freedom, his 
        home, Cedar Hill, was established as a National Historic Site 
        in Anacostia, in Southeast Washington, DC.
            (9) Frederick Douglass was deeply committed to obtaining 
        equal congressional voting and self-government rights for 
        District of Columbia residents and his statue in the United 
        States Capitol is a gift from the almost 650,000 American 
        citizens of the District of Columbia.
            (10) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of 
        Frederick Douglass, for Douglass dedicated his own life to 
        ensuring freedom and equality for future generations of 
        Americans. This Nation should ensure that his tireless 
        struggle, transformative words, and inclusive vision of 
        humanity continue to inspire and sustain us.
            (11) The year 2018 marks the bicentennial anniversary of 
        the birth of Frederick Douglass, and a commission should be 
        established to study and recommend to Congress activities that 
        are fitting and proper to celebrate that anniversary in a 
        manner that appropriately honors Frederick Douglass.
