                                 A BILL


 
To establish programs with respect to childhood, adolescent, and young 
                             adult cancer.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer 
Childhood Cancer Reauthorization Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Every year, 13,500 children in the United States are 
        diagnosed with cancer.
            (2) While the cure rates for some childhood cancers are now 
        over 80 percent, the survival rates for many types of cancers 
        in children remain extremely low.
            (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, cancer continues to be the leading cause of death 
        by disease in children and adolescents under the age of 14.
            (4) There are currently more than 360,000 childhood cancer 
        survivors living in the United States.
            (5) As many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors 
        experience at least one long-term health effect of their cancer 
        treatment, including secondary malignancies, cardiopulmonary 
        damage, physical and intellectual developmental impairments, 
        endocrine disorders, and others.
            (6) Collection of biospecimens and clinical and demographic 
        data on the maximum possible number of children with cancer in 
        the United States is necessary to improve childhood cancer 
        treatments and cures. Currently biospecimens and some 
        demographic data are collected for less than half of children 
        with cancer.

SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE CHILDREN'S CANCER BIOREPOSITORIES.

    (a) In General.--Section 417E of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 285a-11) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections 
        (k) and (l), respectively;
            (2) by striking subsections (a) and (b) and inserting the 
        following:
    ``(a) Comprehensive Children's Cancer Biorepositories.--The 
Secretary, acting through the Director of NIH, may make an award for a 
duration of at least 5 years to an entity or entities described in 
subsection (d) to build upon existing initiatives to collect 
biospecimens and clinical and demographic information for at least 90 
percent of all children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer in 1 
or more Comprehensive Children's Cancer Biorepositories to achieve a 
better understanding of the cause of such cancers and the effects of 
treatments for such cancers.
    ``(b) Use of Funds.--Amounts received under the award under 
subsection (a) may be used to carry out the following:
            ``(1) Prospectively acquire, preserve, and store high-

        demographic information on children, adolescents, and young 
        adults diagnosed with cancer in the United States.
            ``(2) Maintain a secure searchable database on stored 
        biospecimens and associated clinical and demographic data from 
        children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer for the 
        conduct of research by scientists and qualified health care 
        professionals.
            ``(3) Establish procedures for evaluating applications for 
        access to such biospecimens and clinical and demographic data 
        from researchers and other qualified health care professionals.

        clinical and demographic data from children, adolescents, and 
        young adults with cancer to researchers and qualified health

    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall report 
to Congress on barriers to studying oncologic therapies in pediatric 
populations under section 505B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
