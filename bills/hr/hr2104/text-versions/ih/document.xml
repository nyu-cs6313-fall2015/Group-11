			 findings:</text>
			<paragraph id="H0124B8FC48BB40E184D63959DE07389E"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The inappropriate
			 display, sale, or purchase of Social Security numbers has contributed to a
			 growing range of illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in
			 some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HA6E88D7C1FAE4FD4BDCC5250C018A342"><enum>(2)</enum><text>While financial
			 institutions, health care providers, and other entities have often used Social
			 Security numbers to confirm the identity of an individual, the general display
			 to the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used to commit
			 crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of individual privacy.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HAAEFC031A95945C8A8FDEEB7E3678A8E"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Federal
			 Government requires virtually every individual in the United States to obtain
			 and maintain a Social Security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for
			 Social Security benefits, or to seek employment. An unintended consequence of
			 these requirements is that Social Security numbers have become one of the tools
			 that can be used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy of
			 the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because the Federal
			 Government created and maintains this system, and because the Federal
			 Government does not permit individuals to exempt themselves from those
			 requirements, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to take steps to
			 stem the abuse of Social Security numbers.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H582CF76751B84F629A6AF25E1AE205B1"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The display, sale,
			 or purchase of Social Security numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited,
			 robust, and wide-open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, or
			 purchase would not affect public debate.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H9B6E11CE41504DA0A59FFD29415C3919"><enum>(5)</enum><text>No one should seek
			 to profit from the display, sale, or purchase of Social Security numbers in
			 circumstances that create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or
			 financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are assigned.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HAC849F4843A540A98F48F1B3C1C190DB"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Consequently, this
			 Act provides each individual that has been assigned a Social Security number
			 some degree of protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that number
			 in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful conduct.</text>
