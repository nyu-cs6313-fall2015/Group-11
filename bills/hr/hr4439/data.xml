  <summary>4/9/2014--Introduced.
Establishes for the Federal Railroad Administration a program for disadvantaged business enterprises, that is, small business concerns owned or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (including women).

Requires that at least 10% of federal funds for covered rail projects be expended on disadvantaged business enterprises.

Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to establish: (1) a unified certification program that lists disadvantaged business enterprises; (2) minimum uniform criteria for certifying small business concerns; and (3) minimum requirements for covered rail project federal funding recipients to report to the Secretary information on minority-owned and women-owned business awards, commitments, and achievements.</summary>
