Allows the EPA to require that test data and other product information be submitted to facilitate product listing and performance verification for a sample of products.\n\nTerminates the exemption from third-party certification provided to a program partner if the partner is found to have violated program requirements with respect to at least two separate models during a two-year period. Resumes the exemption if the partner complies with all program requirements for at least three years."
