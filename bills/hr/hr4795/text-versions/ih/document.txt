accessible location on the Environmental Protection Agency's public 
Website the Agency's estimate of the following:
            (1) The total number of preconstruction permits issued 
        during the fiscal year.

    (b) Initial Publication; Updates.--The Administrator shall--
            (1) make the publication required by subsection (a) for

            (1) With respect to information to be published for fiscal 
        years 2008 through 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency's

            (2) With respect to information to be published for any 
        fiscal year, nothing in the section compels the Environmental 
        Protection Agency to seek or collect any information in

        States and local air agencies for the RACT/BACT/LAER

SEC. 3. TIMELY ISSUANCE OF REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE TO ADDRESS NEW OR

    (a) In General.--In publishing any final rule establishing or 
revising a national ambient air quality standard, the Administrator 
shall, as the Administrator determines necessary and appropriate to 
assist States, permitting authorities, and permit applicants, 
concurrently publish regulations and guidance for implementing the 
standard, including information relating to submission and 
consideration of a preconstruction permit application under the new or 
revised standard.
    (b) Applicability of Standard to Preconstruction Permitting.--If 
the Administrator fails to publish final regulations and guidance that 
include information relating to submission and consideration of a

standard shall not apply to the review and disposition of a 
preconstruction permit application until the Agency has published such 
final regulations and guidance.

        regulations or guidance to assist States and facilities in 
        implementing such standards.
            (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to eliminate 
        the obligation of a preconstruction permit applicant to install 
        best available control technology and lowest achievable 
        emissions rate technology, as applicable.

SEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON ACTIONS TO EXPEDITE REVIEW OF
