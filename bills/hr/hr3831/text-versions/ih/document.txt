        provide dialysis care to patients at certain outpatient 
        facilities operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
            (2) The term ``initial facility'' means one of the four 
        outpatient facilities identified by the Secretary to 
        participate in the dialysis pilot program prior to the date of
