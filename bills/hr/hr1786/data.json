Directs the Committee to oversee Program planning and coordination and to develop and submit to Congress a strategic plan, progress report, and coordinated budget for the Program.\n\n(Sec. 4) Revises provisions providing for the establishment of an Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction (currently, the National Advisory Committee on Windstorm Impact Reduction), which shall: (1) be composed of at least seven non-federal members, (2) provide recommendations to be considered by federal agencies in implementing the Program, and (3) offer assessments of the priorities of the Program's strategic plan, coordination of the Program, and Program revisions. Terminates the Committee on September 30, 2016.\n\nAuthorizes appropriations to the Program agencies for FY2014-FY2015 for carrying out the Program."
