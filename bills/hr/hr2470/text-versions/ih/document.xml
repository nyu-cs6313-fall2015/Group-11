In addition, eligibility for many Federal and State programs for assistance to working families, such as the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit, supplemental nutritional assistance program, housing assistance programs, Federal and State health care programs, child care assistance, and temporary assistance to needy families, is based in part on income levels. The rates at which the benefits from such programs are phased out have the same disposable income reducing effect as escalating marginal tax rates.</text></paragraph>
