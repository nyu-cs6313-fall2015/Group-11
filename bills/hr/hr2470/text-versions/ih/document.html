_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To establish the National Commission on Effective Marginal Tax Rates 
                        for Low-Income Families.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Making Work and Marriage Pay Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The take-home pay of low-income families is subject to 
        reductions from many sources, including the Federal income tax, 
        Social Security payroll taxes, and State income taxes. In 
        addition, eligibility for many Federal and State programs for 
        assistance to working families, such as the earned income tax 
        credit, the child tax credit, supplemental nutritional 
        assistance program, housing assistance programs, Federal and 
        State health care programs, child care assistance, and 
        temporary assistance to needy families, is based in part on 
        income levels. The rates at which the benefits from such 
        programs are phased out have the same disposable income 
        reducing effect as escalating marginal tax rates.
            (2) The total effective marginal rate of tax for additional 
        income earned by low-income people can exceed 100 percent and 
        can be a disincentive to working more hours, getting a raise, 
        seeking education toward a more lucrative trade, getting 
        married, or engaging in other economic or social activities.
            (3) Congress has enacted each of these programs without 
        full consideration of the impact it would have on other 
        existing programs. As a result, the structure of the United 
        States system for the support of low-income families is 
        uncoordinated and contains features which work against the goal 
        of encouraging families to work their way toward self-
        sufficiency.

            (1) Low-income.--The term ``low-income'' means, with

SEC. 4. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON EFFECTIVE MARGINAL TAX RATES FOR LOW-
              INCOME FAMILIES.

    (a) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be known 
as the ``National Commission on Effective Marginal Tax Rates for Low-
Income Families'' (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the 
``Commission'').
    (b) Duties of Commission.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission shall study and make 
        recommendations on policy changes to mitigate the impact of the 
        effective marginal tax rate and of phaseouts in Federal 
        benefits on low-income earners and their families.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the first 
        meeting of the Commission, the Commission shall submit to the 
        President and to the Chairman and Ranking member of each 
        Committee of the House and the Senate that has legislative 
        jurisdiction over any of the Federal programs or revenue 
        policies addressed therein, a report containing the following:
                    (A) Analysis.--A detailed analysis of the 
                following:
                            (i) The Commission's general 
                        recommendations for increasing coordination of 
                        the delivery of Federal benefits for low-income 
                        families in order to reduce effective marginal 
                        tax rates and decrease disincentives to work 
                        and marriage.
                            (ii) The relative usefulness of sudden 
                        benefit cutoffs (sometime referred to as 
                        ``cliffs'') versus gradual reductions (sometime 
                        referred to as ``phaseouts'') in Federal 
                        benefits on low-income workers' behavior 
                        relating to work and marriage.
                            (iii) The interaction of Federal benefits 
                        and State assistance programs, and the 
                        potential benefits of structuring State 
                        programs consistent with the design of Federal 
                        assistance.
                            (iv) The maximum extent to which funding 
                        for Federal benefits can be appropriated 
                        annually avoiding the need to create additional 
                        entitlement programs.
                            (v) The extent to which low-income 
                        cohabiting couples (including couples with 
                        children and couples without children) resist 
                        entering a legal marriage in order to maximize 
                        Federal benefits and avoid lost income.
                    (B) Recommendations.--
                            (i) In general.--A description of the 
                        Commission's recommendations relating to the 
                        following:
                                    (I) Combining all Federal benefits 
                                which are not tax benefits into a 
                                single flexible voucher, allowing the 
                                beneficiary to allocate funds within 
                                each of the supported benefit areas.
                                    (II) To the extent possible, 
                                providing all eligible families with 
                                equal voucher funds described in 
                                subclause (I), varying only for income, 
                                family size, and the presence of 
                                children in the household.
                                    (III) Combining all Federal 
                                benefits which are tax benefits for 
                                low-income families into a coordinated 
                                credit that minimizes phaseouts, 
                                encourages work, is adjusted for family 
                                size, and does not penalize marriage.
                                    (IV) Establishing a single 
                                eligibility standard for all Federal 
                                benefits.
                            (ii) Revenue neutrality.--In making 
                        recommendations under this subparagraph, the 
                        Commission shall consider the need to maintain 
                        revenue neutrality in order to avoid increasing 
                        the deficit.
                            (iii) Blueprint for legislation.--The 
                        Commission shall provide a blueprint for 
                        legislative proposals for each policy 
                        recommendation under this subparagraph.
                    (C) Other matters.--
                            (i) Non-feasibility.--Should the Commission 
                        conclude that the policy framework described in 
                        subparagraph (B) is not feasible, the 
                        Commission shall include in its report--
                                    (I) a detailed analysis of such 
                                policy framework,
                                    (II) a comprehensive explanation of 
                                the reasons for its conclusion, and
                                    (III) one or more policy 
                                recommendations addressing the problem 
                                of effective marginal tax rates on low-
                                income families.
                            (ii) Additional matter.--If the Commission 
                        includes in its report a policy plan using the 
                        policy elements described in subparagraph (B), 
                        it may also include additional alternative 
                        recommendations (together with a legislative 
                        blueprint as provided under subparagraph
