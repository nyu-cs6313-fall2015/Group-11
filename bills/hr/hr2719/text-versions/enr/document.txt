                                 An Act


 
To require the Transportation Security Administration to implement best 
practices and improve transparency with regard to technology acquisition 
                    programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Security Acquisition 
Reform Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds the following:
        (1) The Transportation Security Administration has not 
    consistently implemented Department of Homeland Security policies 
    and Government best practices for acquisition and procurement.
        (2) The Transportation Security Administration has only 
    recently developed a multiyear technology investment plan, and has 
    underutilized innovation opportunities within the private sector, 
    including from small businesses.
        (3) The Transportation Security Administration has faced 
    challenges in meeting key performance requirements for several 
    major acquisitions and procurements, resulting in reduced security 
    effectiveness and wasted expenditures.
