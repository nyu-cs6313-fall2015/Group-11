    Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives (H.R. 
2719) entitled ``An Act to require the Transportation Security 
Administration to implement best practices and improve transparency 
with regard to technology acquisition programs, and for other 
purposes.'', do pass with the following

                               AMENDMENT:

            Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the 
      following:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Security Acquisition 
Reform Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Transportation Security Administration has not 
        consistently implemented Department of Homeland Security 
        policies and Government best practices for acquisition and 
        procurement.
            (2) The Transportation Security Administration has only 
        recently developed a multiyear technology investment plan, and 
        has underutilized innovation opportunities within the private 
        sector, including from small businesses.
            (3) The Transportation Security Administration has faced 
        challenges in meeting key performance requirements for several 
        major acquisitions and procurements, resulting in reduced 
        security effectiveness and wasted expenditures.
