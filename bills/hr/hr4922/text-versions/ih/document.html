                        the placement of an additional eligible

        educational assistance under this chapter whom the Secretary 
        approves for participation in the program established under

        individual in an internship on a full-time basis with an

        Department of Veterans Affairs and not the eligible employer 
        during the period of such internship under the program.
            ``(4) Relation to other federal assistance.--
        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, pay received by an

        assistance.
            ``(5) Certification.--For each month that an individual
