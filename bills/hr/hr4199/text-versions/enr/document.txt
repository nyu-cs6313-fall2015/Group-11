    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) On October 12, 1919, Doris Miller was born in Waco, Texas.
        (2) On September 16, 1939, Miller enlisted in the United States 
    Navy as mess attendant, third class at Naval Recruiting Station, 
    Dallas, Texas, to serve for a period of six years.
        (3) On February 16, 1941, Miller received a change of rating to 
    mess attendant, second class.

    attendant, first class.
        (5) On June 1, 1943, Miller received a change of rating, to 
    cook, third class.
        (6) On November 25, 1944, Miller was presumed dead by the 
    Secretary of the Navy a year and a day after being carried as 
    missing in action since November 24, 1943, while serving aboard USS 
    Liscome Bay when that vessel was torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific 
    Ocean.
        (7) Miller was awarded the Navy Cross Medal, Purple Heart 
    Medal, American Defense Service Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign 
    Medal, and World War II Victory Medal.
        (8) Miller's citation for the Navy Cross said ``for 
    distinguished devotion to duty, extraordinary courage and disregard

    Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, by Japanese forces on December 7, 
    1941. While at the side of his Captain on the bridge, Miller, 
    despite enemy strafing and bombing and in the face of a serious 
    fire, assisted in moving his Captain, who had been mortally 
    wounded, to a place of greater safety, and later manned and 
    operated a machine gun directed at enemy Japanese attacking 
    aircraft until ordered to leave the bridge.''.
