                                considers appropriate.
                            (ii) If an agency or program is funded in

            (3) Relocation of federal employees.--The proposed

        position of an employee of an agency is eliminated as a result 
        of the implementation of the plan under paragraph (1)(A), the 
        affected agency shall make reasonable efforts to relocate such 
        employee to another position within the agency or within

SEC. 8. CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF REFORM PROPOSALS.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section--
            (1) the term ``implementation bill'' means only a bill 
        which is introduced as provided under subsection (b), and 
        contains the proposed legislation included in a report 
        submitted to Congress under section 3, without modification; 
        and
            (2) the term ``calendar day'' means a calendar day other 
        than one on which either House is not in session because of an 
        adjournment of more than 3 days to a date certain.
    (b) Introduction; Referral; and Report or Discharge.--
            (1) Introduction.--On the first calendar day on which both 
        Houses are in session, on or immediately following the date on 
        which the report is submitted to Congress under section 3, a 
        single implementation bill shall be introduced (by request)--
                    (A) in the Senate by the majority leader of the 
                Senate, for himself and the minority leader of the 
                Senate, or by Members of the Senate designated by the 
                majority leader and minority leader of the Senate; and
                    (B) in the House of Representatives by the Speaker 
                of the House of Representatives, for himself and the 
                minority leader of the House of Representatives, or by 
                Members of the House of Representatives designated by 
                the Speaker and minority leader of the House of 
                Representatives.
            (2) Referral.--The implementation bills introduced under 
        paragraph (1) shall be referred to any appropriate committee of 
        jurisdiction in the Senate and any appropriate committee of 
        jurisdiction in the House of Representatives. A committee to 
        which an implementation bill is referred under this paragraph 
        may report such bill to the respective House without amendment.
            (3) Report or discharge.--If a committee to which an 
        implementation bill is referred has not reported such bill by 
        the end of the 15th calendar day after the date of the 
        introduction of such bill, such committee shall be immediately 
        discharged from further consideration of such bill, and upon 
        being reported or discharged from the committee, such bill 
        shall be placed on the appropriate calendar.
    (c) Floor Consideration.--
            (1) In general.--When the committee to which an 
        implementation bill is referred has reported, or has been 
        discharged under subsection (b)(3), it is at any time 
        thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same 
        effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective 
        House to move to proceed to the consideration of the 
        implementation bill, and all points of order against the 
        implementation bill (and against consideration of the 
        implementation bill) are waived. The motion is highly 
        privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged in 
        the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to 
        amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to 
        proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or 
        disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to 
        the consideration of the implementation bill is agreed to, the 
        implementation bill shall remain the unfinished business of the 
        respective House until disposed of.
            (2) Amendments.--An implementation bill may not be amended 
        in the Senate or the House of Representatives.
            (3) Debate.--Debate on the implementation bill, and on all 
        debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be 
        limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided 
        equally between those favoring and those opposing the 
        resolution. A motion further to limit debate is in order and 
        not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a 
        motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a 
        motion to recommit the implementation bill is not in order. A 
        motion to reconsider the vote by which the implementation bill 
        is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.
            (4) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the 
        conclusion of the debate on an implementation bill, and a 
        single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested 
        in accordance with the rules of the appropriate House, the vote 
        on final passage of the implementation bill shall occur.
            (5) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the 
        decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules 
        of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may 
        be, to the procedure relating to an implementation bill shall 
        be decided without debate.
    (d) Coordination With Action by Other House.--If, before the 
passage by one House of an implementation bill of that House, that 
House receives from the other House an implementation bill, then the 
following procedures shall apply:
            (1) Nonreferral.--The implementation bill of the other 
        House shall not be referred to a committee.
            (2) Vote on bill of other house.--With respect to an 
        implementation bill of the House receiving the implementation 
        bill--
                    (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same 
                as if no implementation bill had been received from the 
                other House; but
                    (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the 
                implementation bill of the other House.
    (e) Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives.--This 
section is enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it 
        is deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of an implementation bill described in 
        subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the 
        extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.
