   To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for a national 
     program to conduct and support activities toward the goal of 
 significantly reducing the number of cases of overweight and obesity 
                among individuals in the United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Healthier Lifelong 
Improvements in Food and Exercise Act'' or the ``LIFE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Currently, 64.5 percent of adults in the United States, 
        age 20 years and older, are overweight and 72 million (more 
        than one-third of the adult population in the United States) 
        are obese.
            (2) Data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination 
        Surveys show that among adults who are 20 to 74 years of age 
        the prevalence of obesity increased from 15.0 percent in the 
        1976-1980 survey to 34.9 percent in the 2011-2012 survey.
            (3) In 2011 and 2012, of children and adolescents 2 to 19 
        years of age more than 12,500,000 (or 17 percent) were 
        overweight, and of adults more than 66,000,000 (or 34.9 
        percent) were obese. Almost 6 percent of adults were extremely 
        obese.
            (4) The percentage of children who are obese has more than 
        doubled, and among adolescents the percentage has more than 
        tripled, since 1980 the obesity rate for adolescents increased 
        from 5 percent to 21 percent.
            (5) More than \1/3\ of adults in the United States do not 
        get enough physical activity and national data have shown an 
        increase in the calorie consumption of adults.
            (6) The rising rates of obesity portend greater disease and 
        health conditions including hypertension, high total 
        cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, 
        gallbladder disease, osteoporosis, sleep apnea, and respiratory 
        problems, and some cancers, such as endometrial, breast, and 
        colon cancer.
            (7) Many underlying factors have been linked to the 
        increase in obesity, such as increasing portion sizes, eating 
        out more often, increased consumption of sugar-sweetened 
        drinks, increasing television, computer, and electronic gaming 
        time, changing labor markets, and fear of crime, which prevents 
        outdoor exercise.
            (8) Chronic diseases account for 1.7 million, or 70 
        percent, of all deaths in the United States each year. Although 
        chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health 
        problems, they are also among the most preventable. Adopting a 
        healthy lifestyle such as eating nutritious foods and engaging 
        in physical activity, can prevent or control the devastating 
        effects of these diseases. Although chronic diseases are among 
        the most common and costly health problems, they are also among 
        the most preventable.
            (9) In 2008, overall medical costs related to obesity for 
        United States adults were estimated to be as high as $147 
        billion. People who were obese had medical costs that were on 
        average $1,429 higher than the cost for people of normal body 
        weight.
