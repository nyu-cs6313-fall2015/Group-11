    program established and maintained by a State, or agency or 
    instrumentality thereof--
            ``(A) under which a person may make contributions for a 
        taxable year, for the benefit of an individual who is an 
        eligible individual for such taxable year, to an ABLE account 
        which is established for the purpose of meeting the qualified 
        disability expenses of the designated beneficiary of the

    treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides that any 
    designated beneficiary under such program may, directly or

    program (or any earnings thereon) no more than 2 times in any 
    calendar year.

    the program or any portion thereof to be used as security for a 
    loan.
