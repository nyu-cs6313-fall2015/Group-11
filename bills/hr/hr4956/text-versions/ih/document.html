    TITLE II--MODIFYING THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE AND FUNDING 
            CONSERVATION AND ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created by 
        Congress in 1975, to protect the Nation from any future oil 
        supply disruptions. When the program was established, United 
        States refiners were capable of handling light crude and medium 
        crude and the makeup of the SPR matched this capacity. This is 
        not the case today.
            (2) A GAO analysis found that nearly half of the refineries 
        considered vulnerable to supply disruptions are not compatible 
        with the types of oil currently stored in the SPR and would be 
        unable to maintain normal refining capacity if forced to rely 
        on SPR oil as currently constituted, thereby reducing the 
        effectiveness of the SPR in the event of a supply disruption. 
        GAO concluded that the SPR should be comprised of at least 10 
        percent heavy crude.
            (3) This Act implements the GAO recommendation and 
        dedicates funds received from the transactions to existing 
        energy conservation, research, and assistance programs.

SEC. 202. DEFINITIONS.

    In this title--
            (1) the term ``light grade petroleum'' means crude oil with 
        an API gravity of 35 degrees or higher;
            (2) the term ``heavy grade petroleum'' means crude oil with 
        an API gravity of 26 degrees or lower; and
            (3) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Energy.

SEC. 203. OBJECTIVES.

    The objectives of this title are as follows:
            (1) To modernize the composition of the Strategic Petroleum 
        Reserve to reflect the current processing capabilities of 
        refineries in the United States.
            (2) To provide increased funding to accelerate 
        conservation, energy research and development, and assistance 
        through existing programs.

SEC. 204. MODIFICATION OF THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.

    Notwithstanding section 161 of the Energy Policy and Conservation 
Act (42 U.S.C. 6241), the Secretary shall publish a plan not later than 
30 days after the date of enactment of this Act to--
            (1) exchange as soon as possible light grade petroleum from 
        the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in an amount equal to 10 
        percent of the total number of barrels of crude oil in the 
        Reserve as of the date of enactment of this Act, for an 
        equivalent volume of heavy grade petroleum plus any additional 
        cash bonus bids received that reflect the difference in the 
        market value between light grade petroleum and heavy grade 
        petroleum and the timing of deliveries of the heavy grade 
        petroleum;
            (2) from the gross proceeds of the cash bonus bids, deposit 
        the amount necessary to pay for the direct administrative and 
        operational costs of the exchange into the SPR Petroleum 
        Account established under section 167 of the Energy Policy and 
        Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6247); and
            (3) deposit 90 percent of the remaining net proceeds from 
        the exchange into the account established under section 205(a).
