SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) There is a strong link between savings and economic 
        opportunity. Children in the poorest fifth of households who 
        manage to move up the income ladder as adults have almost ten 
        times the wealth of those who remain at the bottom.
            (2) Even a small amount of children's savings can have a 
        significant impact on college success, a key driver of economic 
        mobility. Low- and moderate-income children with less than $500 
        saved for college are three times more likely to enroll in 
        college and four times more likely to graduate than children 
        with no savings.
            (3) Most working families in America lack savings and face 
        financial insecurity as a result. 44 percent of families are 
        ``liquid asset poor,'' meaning they lack accessible savings to 
        survive for three months at the Federal poverty level.
            (4) Families with children face additional barriers to 
        building savings. These families are more likely than childless 
        households to live in asset poverty.
            (5) The Great Recession has exacerbated financial 
        insecurity for millions of American families. Between 2009 and 
        2011, the bottom 93 percent of households saw a drop in net 
        worth, while the wealthiest 7 percent of households saw a 
        significant increase in net worth.
            (6) Children's savings accounts programs are evidence-based 
        and have been tested throughout the country. In 2003, the 
        Saving for Education, Entrepreneurship, and Downpayment (SEED) 
        national demonstration project was established to evaluate the 
        policy and practice of savings accounts for children. SEED 
        found that even very low-income parents will save and invest 
        for their children's future if given the opportunity.
            (7) Since 2009, publicly funded, universal children's 
        savings accounts programs have launched citywide in San 
        Francisco, California, countywide in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and 
        statewide in Nevada and Maine. Additional children's savings 
        programs serving thousands of children have launched or are 
        launching in Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, 
        Minnesota, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, 
        South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Washington, DC.
            (8) In order to expand economic opportunity and spur 
        economic growth, the United States should promote savings and 
        investments for all Americans.

SEC. 3. USACCOUNT FUND.

    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of the 
United States a fund to be known as the ``USAccount Fund''.
    (b) Amounts Held by Fund.--The USAccount Fund consists of the sum 
of all amounts paid into the Fund under this Act, increased by the 
total net earnings from investments of sums held in the Fund or reduced 
by the total net losses from investments of sums held in the Fund, and 
reduced by the total amount of payments made from the Fund (including 
payments for administrative expenses).
    (c) Use of Fund.--
            (1) In general.--The sums in the USAccount Fund are 
        appropriated and shall remain available without fiscal year 
        limitation--

                    (C) to make distributions in accordance with this 
                Act,
                    (D) to pay the administrative expenses of carrying 
                out this Act, and
                    (E) to purchase insurance as provided in section 
                8(c)(2).
            (2) Exclusive purposes.--The sums in the USAccount Fund 
        shall not be appropriated for any purpose other than the 
        purposes specified in this section and may not be used for any 
        other purpose.
    (d) Transfers to USAccount Fund.--The Secretary shall make 
transfers from the general fund of the Treasury to the USAccount Fund 
as follows:
            (1) Automatic contribution.--Upon receipt of a 
        certification under section 4(b)(2) with respect to an 
        individual, the Secretary shall transfer $500 to the USAccount 
        of the individual.
            (2) Matching contributions.--Upon receipt of each 
        certification under section 4(d) with respect to an individual, 
        the Secretary shall transfer the matching amount to the 
        USAccount of the individual.
    (e) Private Contributions.--The Executive Director shall pay into 
the USAccount Fund such amounts as are contributed under section 4(c).
    (f) Prohibition on Use of Payroll Taxes To Fund USAccounts.--The 
USAccount Fund and USAccounts are wholly separate and unique from the 
Social Security system. No amount from any tax on employment may be 
contributed to the USAccount Fund or USAccounts.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Establishment.--The Executive Director shall establish 
        in the USAccount Fund an account (to be known as a 
        ``USAccount'') for each qualifying child certified under 
        subsection (b). Each such account shall be identified to its 
        account holder by means of a unique personal identifier 
        currently recognized by the Internal Revenue Service and shall 
        remain in the USAccount Fund unless transferred to private 
        management under subsection (g).
            (2) Account balance.--The balance in an account holder's 
        USAccount at any time is the excess of--
                    (A) the sum of--
                            (i) all deposits made into the USAccount 
                        Fund and credited to the account under 
                        paragraph (3), and
                            (ii) the total amount of allocations made 
                        to and reductions made in the account pursuant 
                        to paragraph (4), over
                    (B) the amounts paid out of the account with 
                respect to such individual under subsection (d).
            (3) Crediting of contributions.--Pursuant to regulations 
        which shall be prescribed by the Executive Director, the 
        Executive Director shall credit to each USAccount the amounts 
        paid into the USAccount Fund under section 3(d) which are 
        attributable to the account holder of such account.
            (4) Allocation of earnings and losses.--The Executive 
        Director shall allocate to each USAccount an amount equal to 
        the net earnings and net losses from each investment of sums in 
        the USAccount Fund which are attributable, on a pro rata basis, 
        to sums credited to such account, reduced by an appropriate 
        share of the administrative expenses paid out of the net

        qualifying child.
    (c) Private Contributions.--
            (1) In general.--The Executive Director shall accept cash 
        contributions for payment into the USAccount Fund if such 
        contribution is identified (in such manner as the Executive 
        Director may require) with the account holder of a USAccount to 
        whom it is to be credited at the time the contribution is made.
            (2) Alternative methods of contribution.--
                    (A) Payroll deduction.--Under regulations 
                prescribed by the Executive Director and at the
