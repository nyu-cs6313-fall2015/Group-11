Provides for an initial government contribution of $500 to a USAccount, private contributions\u00a0up to $2,000, and\u00a0government matching contributions up to $500 in a calendar year. Allows tax-exempt distributions from USAccounts\u00a0for higher education expenses and for funding individual retirement plans of a qualifying child.\n\nEstablishes in the executive branch a USAccount Fund Board to\u00a0manage investments in the USAccount Fund.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exempt the USAccount Fund and USAccounts from income taxation, and (2) increase the amount of the child tax credit by the applicable USAccount contribution amount."
