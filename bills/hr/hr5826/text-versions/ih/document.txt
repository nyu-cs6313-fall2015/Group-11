determines that a requirement of title VI is inconsistent with the 
purposes of this section.''.

        subsection (a)(1), in accordance with a formula to be 
        established by the Administrator, after providing notice and an 
        opportunity for public comment, that allocates to each State a 
        proportional share of such amounts based on the total needs of 
        the State for municipal combined sewer overflow controls and 
        sanitary sewer overflow controls identified in the most recent 
        survey conducted pursuant to section 516.''.
