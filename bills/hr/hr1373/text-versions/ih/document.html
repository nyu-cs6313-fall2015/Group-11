representative. If any miner is not currently working in such mine as 
the result of an accident in such mine, but would be currently working 
in such mine but for such accident, such miner may designate such a 
representative. A representative of miners shall have the right to 
participate in any accident investigation the Secretary initiates 
pursuant to subsection (b), including the right to participate in 
investigative interviews and to review all relevant papers, books, 
documents and records produced in connection with the accident

and during any litigation under this Act, no attorney shall represent 
or purport to represent both the operator of a coal or other mine and 
any other individual, unless such individual has knowingly and 
voluntarily waived all actual and reasonably foreseeable conflicts of 
interest resulting from such representation. The Secretary is 
authorized to take such actions as the Secretary considers appropriate 
to ascertain whether such individual has knowingly and voluntarily 
waived all such conflicts of interest. If the Secretary finds that such 
an individual cannot be represented adequately by such an attorney due 
to such conflicts of interest, the Secretary may petition the 
appropriate United States District Court which shall have jurisdiction 
to disqualify such attorney as counsel to such individual in the 
matter. The Secretary may make such a motion as part of an ongoing 
related civil action or as a miscellaneous action.''.

                any of them provides information to an authorized 
                representative of the Secretary, to a State or local 
                mine safety or health officer or official, or to other 
                law enforcement officer, in reasonable belief that the 
                information is true and related to an apparent health 
                or safety violation, or to an apparent unhealthful or 
                unsafe condition, policy, or practice under this Act,

                information,
        shall be fined under title 18 or imprisoned for not more than 5 
        years, or both.''.
    (b) Advance Notice of Inspections.--
            (1) In general.--Section 110(e) (30 U.S.C. 820(e)) is 
        amended to read as follows:
    ``(e) Whoever knowingly, with intent to give advance notice of an 
inspection conducted or to be conducted under this Act, and thereby to 
impede, interfere with, or frustrate such inspection, engages in, or 
directs another person to engage in, conduct that a reasonable person 
would expect to result in such advance notice, shall be fined under 
title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, 
or both, except that a miner (other than a director, officer or agent 
of the operator involved) who commits the offense at the direction of a 
superior shall be fined under title 18, or imprisoned not more than 1 
year, or both, unless the miner commits a second or subsequent offense 
under this subsection (without regard to whether the offense was 
committed at the direction of a superior) in which case the miner shall 
be fined for such second and subsequent offense under title 18, United 
States Code, or imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both.''.
            (2) Posting of advance notice penalties.--Section 109 (30

or other mine shall post, on the bulletin board described in subsection 
(a) and in a conspicuous place near each staffed entrance onto the mine 
property, a notice stating, in a form and manner to be prescribed by 
the Secretary--
            ``(1) that it is unlawful pursuant to section 110(e) for 
        any person, with the intent to impede, interfere with, or 
        frustrate an inspection conducted or to be conducted under this 
        Act, to engage in, or direct another person to engage in, any 
        conduct that a reasonable person would expect to result in 
        advance notice of such inspection; and
            ``(2) the maximum penalties for a violation under such 
        subsection.''.

SEC. 304. COMMISSION REVIEW OF PENALTY ASSESSMENTS.

    Section 110(i) (30 U.S.C. 820(i)) is amended by striking ``In 
assessing civil monetary penalties, the Commission shall consider'' and 
inserting the following: ``In any review of a citation and proposed 
penalty assessment contested by an operator, the Commission shall 
assess not less than the penalty derived by using the same methodology 
(including any point system) prescribed in regulations under this Act, 
so as to ensure consistency in operator penalty assessments, except 
that the Commission may assess a penalty for less than the amount that 
would result from the utilization of such methodology if the Commission 
finds that there are extraordinary circumstances. If there is no such 
methodology prescribed for a citation or there are such extraordinary 
circumstances, the Commission shall assess the penalty by 
considering''.

SEC. 305. DELINQUENT PAYMENTS AND PREJUDGMENT INTEREST.

    (a) Pre-Final Order Interest.--Section 110(j) (30 U.S.C. 820(j)) is

following: ``Pre-final order interest on such penalties shall begin to 
accrue on the date the operator contests a citation issued under this 
Act, including any mandatory health or safety standard or regulation 
promulgated under this Act, and shall end upon the issuance of the 
final order. Such pre-final order interest shall be calculated at the 
current underpayment rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury 
pursuant to section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and 
shall be compounded daily. Post-final order interest shall begin to 
accrue 30 days after the date a final order of the Commission or the 
court is issued, and shall be charged at the rate of 8 percent per 
annum.''.
    (b) Ensuring Payment of Penalties.--
            (1) Amendments.--Section 110 (30 U.S.C. 820) is further 
        amended--
                    (A) by redesignating subsection (l) as subsection 
                (m); and
                    (B) by inserting after subsection (k) the 
                following:
    ``(l) Ensuring Payment of Penalties.--
            ``(1) Delinquent payment letter.--If the operator of a coal 
        or other mine fails to pay any civil penalty assessment that 
        has become a final order of the Commission or a court within 45 
        days after such assessment became a final order, the Secretary 
        shall send the operator a letter advising the operator of the 
        consequences under this subsection of such failure to pay. The 
        letter shall also advise the operator of the opportunity to 
        enter into or modify a payment plan with the Secretary based 
        upon a demonstrated inability to pay, the procedure for 
        entering into such plan, and the consequences of not entering 
        into or not complying with such plan.
            ``(2) Withdrawal orders following failure to pay.--If an 
        operator that receives a letter under paragraph (1) has not 
        paid the assessment by the date that is 180 days after such 
        assessment became a final order and has not entered into a 
        payment plan with the Secretary, the Secretary shall issue an 
        order requiring such operator to cause all persons, except 
        those referred to in section 104(c), to be withdrawn from, and 
        to be prohibited from entering, the mine that is covered by the 
        final order described in paragraph (1), until the operator pays 
        such assessment in full (including interest and administrative 
        costs) or enters into a payment plan with the Secretary. If 
        such operator enters into a payment plan with the Secretary and 
        at any time fails to comply with the terms specified in such 
        payment plan, the Secretary shall issue an order requiring such 
        operator to cause all persons, except those referred to in 
        section 104(c), to be withdrawn from the mine that is covered 
        by such final order, and to be prohibited from entering such 
        mine, until the operator rectifies the noncompliance with the 
        payment plan in the manner specified in such payment plan.''.
            (2) Applicability and effective date.--The amendments made 
        by paragraph (1) shall apply to all unpaid civil penalty 
        assessments under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 
        1977 (30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), except that, for any unpaid civil 
        penalty assessment that became a final order of the Commission 
        or a court before the date of enactment of this Act, the time 
        periods under section 110(n) of the Federal Mine Safety and 
        Health Act of 1977 (as amended) (30 U.S.C. 820(n)) shall be 
        calculated as beginning on the date of enactment of this Act 
        instead of on the date of the final order.

                the Secretary, shall order the immediate reinstatement

        compensation by the operator at their regular rates of pay and 
        in accordance with their regular schedules of pay, from the 
        time of such closure until such time as the Secretary 
        authorizes reopening of such mine or such area of the mine, not 
        to exceed 60 days, except where an operator promptly withdraws 
        miners upon discovery of a hazard, and notifies the Secretary 
        where required, and within the prescribed time period.
            ``(3) Refusal to comply.--Whenever an operator violates or 
        fails or refuses to comply with any order issued under section

        authority of the Secretary to order miners withdrawn from a 
        mine under this Act, the Secretary shall order a mine that has 
        been subject to a withdrawal order under section 103, 104, 107, 
        108, or 110, and has reopened, to be closed again if 
        compensation in accordance with the provisions of this section 
        is not paid by the end of the next regularly scheduled payroll 
        period following the lifting of a withdrawal order.
