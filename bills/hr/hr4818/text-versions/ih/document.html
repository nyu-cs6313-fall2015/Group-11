in-state tuition at public four-year colleges and universities located 
in the State in which the spouse resides in tuition assistance for 
education and training courses and licensing and credentialing fees.
    ``(B) Financial assistance provided under the MyCAA program shall

        offered through professional associations.
            ``(iv) Degree programs, including programs at four-year 
        colleges and universities, leading to employment in portable 
        careers.
            ``(v) Secondary education completion courses, GED tests, 
        and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes.

Assistance document before incurring the tuition fees for which payment 
under the program is sought. The MyCAA program does not provide 
reimbursements of any kind to spouses for any reason. Once the eligible

sought under the program while the member of the armed forces who is 
married to the spouse is serving on active duty.''.

the MyCAA program available to all eligible spouses.''.
