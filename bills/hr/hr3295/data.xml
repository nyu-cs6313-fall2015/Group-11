Eliminating Disparities in Breast Cancer Treatment Act of 2013 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish a breast cancer treatment quality performance system to: (1) assess and disclose publicly, through the use of quality measures, the quality of care provided for the treatment of breast cancer by specified health care providers; and (2) base payment to such providers for such treatment on their performance with respect to such measures.

Requires reduced payments to providers that either do not submit data in accordance with the reporting process in the system, or furnish low quality care for treatment of breast cancer.</summary>
