        the period described in paragraph (2), the payroll 
        administrator of that agency shall deposit in an escrow account

        official only upon the expiration of such period.
            (2) Period described.--With respect to a responsible

            (3) Withholding and remittance of amounts from payments 
        held in escrow.--The payroll administrator shall provide for 
        the same withholding and remittance with respect to a payment 
        deposited in an escrow account under paragraph (1) that would 
        apply to the payment if the payment were not subject to 
        paragraph (1).
            (4) Release of amounts at end of appointment.--
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the 
        payroll administrator shall release for payment to a

        section any pay which was so withheld from such official and 
        which remains in an escrow account under this section on the 
        last day on which that individual serves in the office by 
        virtue of which such individual is considered to be the 
        responsible official.
            (5) Role of secretary of the treasury.--The Secretary of 
        the Treasury shall provide a payroll administrator of an agency 
        with such assistance as may be necessary to enable such payroll 
        administrator to carry out this section.
