For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State that has

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, insofar as funds have been

effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this Act, to

            (1) any amounts that are so appropriated that are not so

        issued; and
            (2) Federal financial participation for medical assistance

        such amendments (or before the date of guidance, if any, 
        regarding the implementation of such amendments) shall not be
