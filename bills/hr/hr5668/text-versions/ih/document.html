                                 A BILL


 
  To suspend the provision of United States foreign assistance to the 
             Palestinian Authority, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Assistance Accountability 
Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since fiscal year 2008, the annual regular-year United 
        States bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has 
        averaged approximately $500 million per fiscal year, including 
        annual averages of approximately $200 million in direct 
        budgetary assistance and $100 million in non-lethal security 
        assistance for the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
            (2) The Government Accountability Office has found some 
        glaring insufficiencies in the vetting process of the foreign 
        aid grants to the Palestinian Authority and as such it is very 
        easy for United States foreign aid dollars to be used to 
        provide a monthly stipend for accused terrorists.
            (3) The Palestinian Authority Government Resolutions 21 and 
        23 (2010) codified into law a longstanding Palestinian 
        Authority practice of providing a monthly salary to ``anyone 
        imprisoned in the occupation's [Israel's] prisons as a result 
        of his participation in the struggle against the occupation.''.
            (4) According to the Palestinian Authority's definition, 
        more than 4,500 Palestinian prisoners as of December 2012 are 
        serving time for terror-related offenses and are recipients of 
        salaries allocated from the Palestinian Authority's general 
        salary budget that range from 2,400 to 12,000 shekels ($680 to 
        $3,400) per month.

SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF UNITED STATES FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO THE 
              PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY.

    (a) Suspension.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall 
suspend the provision of United States foreign assistance to the 
Palestinian Authority.
    (b) Reinstatement.--
            (1) In general.--The President may reinstate the provision 
        of United States foreign assistance to the Palestinian 
        Authority that is suspended under subsection (a) if the 
        President determines that the Palestinian Authority has taken 
        sufficient action to stop providing funds or rewards to 
        terrorist organizations and working with terrorist 
        organizations, including Hamas.
            (2) Consultation.--The President shall consult with 
        Congress regarding the matters described in paragraph (1) prior 
        to making a determination under paragraph (1).

SEC. 4. REPORT.

    The President shall submit to Congress on an annual basis a report 
on matters relating to this Act, including documentation on the extent 
to which the Palestinian Authority works with or otherwise supports 
terrorist organizations.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
