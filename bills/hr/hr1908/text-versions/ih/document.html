                                 A BILL


 
 To repeal certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
     Care Act relating to the premium tax credits and cost-sharing 
                               subsidies.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Repeal of Expensive 
Exchanges Act'' or the ``FREE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act makes 
        health care more expensive and less accessible, while also 
        driving up the Federal deficit and debt.
            (2) This increase in cost is most noticeable in the health 
        insurance exchanges established under such Act, which would 
        increase the Federal deficit by $1.017 trillion over an eleven-
        year timeframe, as stated in a July, 2012 Congressional Budget 
        Office report.
            (3) The Federal mandate to establish health insurance 
        exchanges directly assaults the States' traditional authority 
        to regulate health insurance.
            (4) Such Federal mandate imposes unknown insurance costs on 
        consumers and administrative costs on States.
            (5) Such Federal mandate imposes a ``one-size-fits-all'' 
        approach that ignores State differences.
            (6) Such Federal mandate undermines choice and competition 
        and guarantees further consolidation of the health insurance 
        markets.
