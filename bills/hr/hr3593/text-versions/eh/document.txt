                                 AN ACT


 
 To amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the construction of 
           major medical facilities, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``VA Construction Assistance Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to testimony by the Director of Physical 
        Infrastructure of the General Accountability Office before the 
        Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives 
        in May 2013, schedule delays of major medical center 
        construction projects of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        have averaged 35 months, with the delays ranging from 14 months 
        to 74 months.
            (2) The average cost increase attributed to such delays has 
        been $336,000,000 per project.
            (3) Management of the major medical facility projects 
        currently underway as of the date of the enactment of this Act 
        in Denver, Colorado, Orlando, Florida, and New Orleans, 
        Louisiana, should be subject to the oversight of a special 
        project manager of the Army Corps of Engineers that is 
        independent of the Department of Veterans Affairs because, 
        according to the Comptroller General of the United States, such 
        projects have experienced continuous delays and a total cost 
        increase of nearly $1,000,000,000.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the management of the major medical center construction 
        projects of the Department of Veterans Affairs has been an 
        abysmal failure; and
            (2) in order to minimize repeated delays and cost increases 
        to such projects, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should 
        fully implement all recommendations made by the Comptroller 
        General of the United States in an April 2013 report to improve 
        construction procedures and practices of the Department.

SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION REFORMS.

    Section 8104 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(i)(1) With respect to each project described in paragraph (2), 
the Secretary shall--
            ``(A) use the services of a medical equipment planner as 
        part of the architectural and engineering firm for the project;
            ``(B) develop and use a project management plan to ensure 
        clear and consistent communication among all parties;
            ``(C) subject the project to construction peer excellence 
        review;
            ``(D) develop--
                    ``(i) a metrics program to enable the monitoring of 
                change-order processing time; and
                    ``(ii) goals for the change-order process 
                consistent with the best practices of other departments 
                and agencies of the Federal Government; and
            ``(E) to the extent practicable, use design-build processes 
        to minimize multiple change orders.
    ``(2) A project described in this paragraph is a construction or 
alteration project that is a major medical facility project.''.
