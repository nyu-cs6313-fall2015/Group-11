Requires the NCCIC to: (1) promote ongoing multi-directional sharing among entities and provide technical assistance as well as crisis management support; (2) identify requirements for data and information formats and accessibility, system interoperability, redundant systems, and alternative capabilities in the event of a disruption in NCCIC's primary information sharing mechanisms; (3) cooperate with international partners to share information and respond to cyber incidents; (4) safeguard sensitive cyber threat information from unauthorized disclosure; and (5) participate in appropriate exercises run by the National Exercise Program.

Directs the NCCIC to require other federal civilian agencies to provide NCCIC with: (1) reports and information about cyber incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities affecting federal civilian information systems and critical infrastructure systems; (2) cyber incident detection, analysis, mitigation, and response information; and (3) cyber threat information received by such agencies. Requires the NCCIC, in the event a private vendor product or service of such an agency is implicated, to first notify such private vendor of a vulnerability before further disclosing such information.

Directs the NCCIC to require federal civilian agencies with data breaches involving unauthorized acquisition or access of personally identifiable information to notify: (1) the NCCIC without unreasonable delay after discovery of the breach; and (2) potential victims without unreasonable delay, based on the risk of harm and consistent with the needs of law enforcement.

 Requires the NCCIC to: (1) collaborate with SCCs, ISACs, SSAs, and relevant critical infrastructure sectors on the development of prioritized federal response efforts to support the defense and recovery of critical infrastructure from cyber incidents; and (2) facilitate continuous improvements to the security and resiliency of public safety communications networks.

Directs the Secretary to report annually to Congress and the Comptroller General (GAO) regarding: (1) major cyber incidents involving federal civilian agency information systems, including aggregate statistics on the number of breaches, the extent of any personally identifiable information involved, the volume of data exfiltrated, the consequential impact, and the estimated cost of remedies; (2) the capacity of the NCCIC to carry out its cybersecurity mission; (3) DHS's interactions with critical infrastructure sectors, SCCs, and SSAs; and (4) the volume and range of voluntary technical assistance sought and provided by DHS to critical infrastructure owners and operators.

Requires a Comptroller General report on the effectiveness of NCCIC.

(Sec. 105) Requires the Secretary to establish Cyber Incident Response Teams to provide technical assistance and recommendations to federal, state, and local government entities, private entities, and critical infrastructure owners and operators.

Directs the Secretary, in coordination with SCCs, ISACs, and federal, state, and local governments, to develop, regularly update, and exercise a National Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan that: (1) includes emergency response plans associated with cyber threats to critical infrastructure, information systems, or networks; (2) adapts to a changing cyber threat environment; (3) incorporates best practices from exercises, training, and after-action reports; and (4) facilitates coordination between DHS and each critical infrastructure sector.

(Sec. 106) Redesignates the National Protection and Programs Directorate as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Directorate.

Requires the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint: (1) the Under Secretary for Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection, (2) the Deputy Under Secretary for Cybersecurity, and (3) the Deputy Under Secretary for Infrastructure Protection.

Requires the Secretary to report to Congress with recommendations for: (1) making the Cybersecurity and Communications Office an operational component of DHS; and (2) restructuring the SAFETY Act Office (the office implementing the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002) within DHS to provide incentives for the development and deployment of anti-terrorism technologies, including the use of third-party registrars to improve the certification process.
