        digital information and control of the power grid for improving 
        reliability, resilience, and congestion and for potentially 
        increasing vulnerability to cyber attack;
            (6) review regulatory, industry, and institutional factors 
        and programs affecting the future of the grid;
            (7) research the costs and benefits, as well as the

            (8) identify the barriers to realizing the options 
        identified and suggest strategies for overcoming those barriers 
        including suggested actions, priorities, incentives, and 
        possible legislative and executive actions; and
            (9) research the ability of the grid to integrate existing 
        and future infrastructure, including utilities, 
        telecommunications lines, highways, and other critical 
        infrastructure.
