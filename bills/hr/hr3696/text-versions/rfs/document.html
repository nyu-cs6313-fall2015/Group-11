        digital information and control of the power grid for improving 
        reliability, resilience, and congestion and for potentially 
        increasing vulnerability to cyber attack;
            (6) review regulatory, industry, and institutional factors 
        and programs affecting the future of the grid;
            (7) research the costs and benefits, as well as the

        identified and suggest strategies for overcoming those barriers 
        including suggested actions, priorities, incentives, and 
        possible legislative and executive actions; and
            (9) research the ability of the grid to integrate existing 
        and future infrastructure, including utilities, 
        telecommunications lines, highways, and other critical 
        infrastructure.
