  <summary>9/18/2014--Introduced.
Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to prohibit any subsection (d) hospital located in an area which after September 30, 2014, is reclassified from a rural to an urban area from being required to waive the application of a wage index increase in order to be eligible for such reclassification for the first two fiscal years for which the reclassification from rural to urban is effective.

(Generally, a subsection [d] hospital is an acute care hospital, particularly one that receives payments under Medicare's inpatient prospective payment system [IPPS] when providing covered inpatient services to eligible beneficiaries.)</summary>
