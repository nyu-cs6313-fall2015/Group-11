 To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to permit the 2-year 
 phase-in for changes in hospital wage index classification from rural 
  to urban without requiring waiver of a wage index increase, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PERMITTING 2-YEAR PHASE-IN OF HOSPITAL WAGE INDEX 
              RECLASSIFICATION FROM RURAL TO URBAN WITHOUT REQUIRING 
              WAIVER OF WAGE INDEX INCREASE.

    Section 1886(d)(13)(G) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395ww(d)(13)(G)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``(G) A hospital'' and inserting ``(G)(i) 
        Except as provided in clause (ii), a hospital''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new clause:
    ``(ii) In the case of any hospital which is located in an area 
which, at any time after September 30, 2014, is reclassified from a 
rural to an urban area, such hospital shall not be required to waive 
the application of a wage index increase under this paragraph in order 
to be eligible for reclassification under paragraph (8)(E) (related to 
treating hospitals as being located in a rural area) for the first two 
fiscal years for which the reclassification from rural to urban is 
effective. The Secretary shall treat any hospital described in this 
clause that reclassifies as rural under paragraph (8)(E) during such 
two fiscal years as not having waived the application of the wage index 
increase under this paragraph.''.
