Energy Star Program Integrity Act - Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prohibit any disclosure relating to participation of a product in the Energy Star program from creating a warranty or giving rise to any private claims or rights of action under state or federal law relating to disqualification of the product from Energy Star if: (1) the product has been certified by a certification body recognized by the program, (2) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved corrective measures, and (3) the responsible party has fully complied with all approved corrective measures.

Prohibits this Act from being construed to require the Administrator to modify any procedure or take any other action.</summary>
