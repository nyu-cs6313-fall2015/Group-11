Requires a certification of the medical condition to be included in the pregnant woman's medical file and kept by the abortion provider for not less than five years.\n\nSubjects an abortion provider who knowingly or recklessly fails to comply with this Act to civil penalties and notification of the appropriate state medical licensing authority. Gives standing to file a civil action for violations of this Act to the Attorney General or a woman upon whom an abortion has been performed in violation of this Act or the parent or legal guardian of such a woman if she is an unemancipated minor."
