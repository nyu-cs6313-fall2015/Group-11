SECTION 1. SCORING OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH SAVINGS.

    Section 202 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act 
of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 602) is amended by adding at the end the following 
new subsection:
    ``(h) Scoring of Preventive Health Savings.--
            ``(1) Determination by the director.--Upon a request by the 
        chairman or ranking minority member of the Committee on the 
        Budget, the Committee on Finance, or the Committee on Health, 
        Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, or by the 
        chairman or ranking minority member of the Committee on the 
        Budget, the Committee on Energy and Commerce, or the Committee 
        on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the Director 
        shall determine if a proposed measure would result in 
        reductions in budget outlays in budgetary outyears through the 
        use of preventive health and preventive health services.
            ``(2) Projections.--If the Director determines that a 
        measure would result in substantial reductions in budget 
        outlays as described in paragraph (1), the Director--
                    ``(A) shall include, in any projection prepared by 
                the Director, a description and estimate of the 
                reductions in budget outlays in the budgetary outyears 
                and a description of the basis for such conclusions; 
                and
                    ``(B) may prepare a budget projection that includes 
                some or all of the budgetary outyears, notwithstanding 
                the time periods for projections described in 
                subsection (e) and sections 308, 402, and 424.
            ``(3) Definitions.--As used in this subsection--
                    ``(A) the term `preventive health' means an action 
                that focuses on the health of the public, individuals 
                and defined populations in order to protect, promote, 
                and maintain health and wellness and prevent disease, 
                disability, and premature death that is demonstrated by 
                credible and publicly available evidence from 
                epidemiological projection models, clinical trials, 
                observational studies in humans, longitudinal studies, 
                and meta-analysis, to avoid future health care costs; 
                and
                    ``(B) the term `budgetary outyears' means the 2 
                consecutive 10-year periods beginning with the first 
                fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year 
                provided for in the most recently agreed to concurrent 
                resolution on the budget.''.
