To amend title 23, United States Code, to require States to dedicate 5 
  percent of certain funds to projects that reduce emission to public 
                safety vehicles, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean and Efficient Public Safety 
Vehicles Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Public safety is a critically important activity.
            (2) The unique nature of public safety vehicles requires 
        the on-board systems of the vehicles to continually operate for 
        communications, health, and public safety reasons.
            (3) The fleets of municipal fire, rescue, police, and 
        safety vehicles require significant fuel use.
            (4) State and local governments strive to reduce operating 
        costs, and to lead by example on emissions policy.
            (5) Congress, through the congestion mitigation and air 
        quality improvement program, has long recognized the importance 
        of partnering with States and municipalities in addressing 
        emissions reduction.
            (6) The private sector has developed a range of 
        technologies matched to light and medium duty public safety 
        vehicles that have not yet been evaluated by the Environmental 
        Protection Agency under its current SmartWay technology 
        verification program.

SEC. 3. SPECIAL RULE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY VEHICLES.

    Section 149(c) of title 23, United States Code, is amended by 
adding at the end the following:
            ``(4) Public safety vehicles.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A State shall obligate 5 percent 
                of the funds apportioned to the State for a fiscal year 
                under section 104(b)(4) for projects to implement, 
                develop, or deploy cost-effective technologies that 
                reduce emissions of pollutants from publicly owned or 
                leased vehicles used to provide public safety services, 
                including firefighting vehicles, ambulances, law 
                enforcement vehicles, and other emergency response 
                vehicles.
                    ``(B) Technology.--Projects carried out under 
                subparagraph (A) shall not be limited to using 
                technology developed or recommended by the SmartWay 
                program of the Environmental Protection Agency or any 
                successor program.''.
                                 <all>
