				<paragraph id="HC502BD716BD849F387CFEC3C94C545B1"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The Strategic
			 Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created by Congress in 1975, to protect the Nation
			 from any future oil supply disruptions. When the program was established,
			 United States refiners were capable of handling light crude and medium crude
			 and the makeup of the SPR matched this capacity. This is not the case
			 today.</text>

			 GAO analysis found that nearly half of the refineries considered vulnerable to
			 supply disruptions are not compatible with the types of oil currently stored in
			 the SPR and would be unable to maintain normal refining capacity if forced to
			 rely on SPR oil as currently constituted, thereby reducing the effectiveness of
			 the SPR in the event of a supply disruption. GAO concluded that the SPR should
			 be comprised of at least 10 percent heavy crude.</text>
