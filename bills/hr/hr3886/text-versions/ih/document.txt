    (a) Exemption.--Section 403 of the Secure Rural Schools and 
Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (16 U.S.C. 7153) is amended by 
adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(c) Exemption From Sequestration.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, any Presidential sequestration order issued after the 
date of the enactment of this subsection under part C of title II of 
the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 
900 et seq.) shall provide that no reduction is made with respect to 
funds made available under section 402 or derived from the other 
funding sources authorized by section 102(b)(3) for the purpose of 
making the payments to States and counties required by section 102.''.
    (b) Reimbursement of Previously Sequestered Payments or Forgiveness 
of Repayment Requirement.--
            (1) Reimbursement required.--Using the payment sources 
        authorized by subsection (b)(3) of section 102 of the Secure 
        Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (16 
        U.S.C. 7112), the Secretary of the Treasury shall reimburse 
        each State or county that, in response to a Presidential 
        sequestration order issued during fiscal year 2013, repaid some 
        of the payment received by the State or county during such 
        fiscal year under such section 102 either by--
                    (A) returning to the Secretary a portion of the 
                payment;
                    (B) having funds deducted from other amounts due 
                the State or county under such Act; or
                    (C) providing some combination of returning and 
                deducting funds.
            (2) Reimbursement amount.--The amount to be reimbursed to a 
        State or county under paragraph (1) shall be equal to the 
        amount repaid by the State or county as provided in such 
        paragraph.
            (3) Forgiveness.--In the case of any State or county that 
        did not repay, before the date of the enactment of this Act, 
        the required portion of the payment received by the State or 
        county during fiscal year 2013 under section 102 of the Secure 
        Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (16 
        U.S.C. 7112) despite the Presidential sequestration order, the 
        Secretary of the Treasury shall waive the repayment 
        requirement.
                                 <all>
