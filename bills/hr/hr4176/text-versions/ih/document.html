sciences will increase such benefits. Congress also recognizes that 
scientists who are both accomplished in their fields and who foster the 
public's interest in science do a special service to the United States. 
To honor their service and to further increase the public's awareness 
about the sciences, there is established the position of Science 
Laureate of the United States.

        Sciences may in its discretion provide a Science Laureate with 
        reimbursement for travel expenses incurred while performing 
        duties as a Science Laureate, including per diem in lieu of 
        subsistence, in accordance with applicable provisions in the
