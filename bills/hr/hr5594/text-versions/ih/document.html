    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
consultation with the Secretary of State, immediately shall suspend 
from the visa waiver program established under section 217 of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187) any country that has 
identified passport holders fighting with Islamic extremist 
organizations, including such groups as the Islamic State of Iraq and 
the Levant (ISIL) and al-Qaeda affiliated organization.
    (b) Restoration of Participation.--The Secretary of Homeland 
Security shall restore a suspended country's participation in the visa 
waiver program upon a determination by the Secretary of State, the 
Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National 
Intelligence of the ability of both the suspended country and the 
United States to identify, track, and negate the risk of any individual 
entering the United States from such country under the visa waiver 
program.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the Comptroller General of the United States should 
        conduct a review of the national security risks associated with 
        the visa waiver program and submit the results of that review 
        to the Congress;
            (2) the Secretary of Homeland Security should take steps to 
        strengthen the electronic travel authorization system described 
        in section 217(h)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
        U.S.C. 1187(h)(3)), identify any individual fighting with an 
        Islamic extremist organization, and deny such individual the 
        ability to enter the United States by means of such system; and
            (3) the Secretary of Homeland Security should complete as 
        expeditiously as possible the biometric entry and exit data 
        system described in section 7208 of the 9/11 Commission 
        Implementation Act of 2004 (8 U.S.C. 1365b).

SEC. 3. TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.

(except in subsection (c)(11)(B)) and inserting ``Secretary of Homeland 
Security''.
