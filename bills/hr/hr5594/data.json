Expresses the sense of the Congress that:\n\n the Comptroller General (GAO) should review the national security risks associated with the visa waiver program and report the results to Congress; the Secretary of DHS should strengthen the electronic travel authorization system (ESTA), identify any individual fighting with an Islamic extremist organization, and deny that individual the ability to enter the United States by means of ESTA; and the Secretary DHS should expeditiously complete the biometric entry and exit data system."
