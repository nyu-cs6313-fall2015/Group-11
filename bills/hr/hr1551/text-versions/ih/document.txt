                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Consumer Credit Protection Act to assure meaningful 
   disclosures of the terms of rental-purchase agreements, including 
disclosures of all costs to consumers under such agreements, to provide 
certain substantive rights to consumers under such agreements, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Rental Purchase Agreement 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The rental-purchase industry provides a service that 
        meets and satisfies the demands of many consumers.
            (2) Each year, approximately 2,300,000 United States 
        households enter into rental-purchase transactions and over a 
        5-year period approximately 4,900,000 United States households 
        will do so.
            (3) Competition among the various firms engaged in the 
        extension of rental-purchase transactions would be strengthened 
        by informed use of rental-purchase transactions.
            (4) The informed use of rental-purchase transactions 
        results from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to assure the 
availability of rental-purchase transactions and to assure simple, 
meaningful, and consistent disclosure of rental-purchase terms so that 
consumers will be able to more readily compare the available rental-
purchase terms and avoid uninformed use of rental-purchase 
transactions, and to protect consumers against unfair rental-purchase 
practices.

shall not be construed so as to prevent a merchant from attempting to 
repossess property during the reinstatement period pursuant to 
subsection (a)(4)(A), but such a repossession does not affect the 
consumer's right to reinstate.

``SEC. 1006. RIGHT TO ACQUIRE OWNERSHIP.

property that is the subject of the rental-purchase agreement, and the

option provided in the rental purchase agreement, and upon payment of 
any past due payments and fees, as permitted in regulation by the 
Board.

that is the subject of the rental-purchase agreement, any fee or charge 
in addition to, or in excess of, the regular periodic payments required 
by subsection (b), or any early purchase option amount provided in the 
rental-purchase agreement, as applicable. A requirement that the 
consumer pay an unpaid late charge or other fee or charge which the 
merchant has previously billed to the consumer shall not constitute an 
additional fee or charge for purposes of this subsection.
    ``(d) Transfer of Ownership Rights.--Upon payment by the consumer 
of all payments necessary to acquire ownership under subsection (b) or 
any early purchase option amount provided in the rental-purchase

        the repossession of the rental property or the collection of 
        any obligation or alleged obligation of the consumer arising 
        out of the rental-purchase agreement;

        periodic payment because a previously assessed late fee has not 
        been paid in full.

``SEC. 1008. STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS.

    ``Upon request of a consumer, a merchant shall provide a statement

    ``(a) Renegotiations.--A renegotiation occurs when a rental-
purchase agreement is satisfied and replaced by a new agreement 
undertaken by the same consumer. A renegotiation requires new 
disclosures, except as provided in subsection (c).

the merchant, to continue an existing rental-purchase agreement beyond 
the original end of the payment schedule, but does not include a 
continuation that is the result of a renegotiation.

        which is readily available to the consumer at the point of 
        rental if the merchandise is not displayed in the merchant's

        impractical due to the size of the merchandise.
            ``(2) Clearly and conspicuously.--As used in this section, 
        the term `clearly and conspicuously' means that information 
        required to be disclosed to the consumer shall appear in a type

at the stated amounts or terms.
    ``(c) Clearly and Conspicuously.--
            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the term

        typically applied in each medium by the Federal Trade 
        Commission.
            ``(3) Limitation.--Nothing contrary to, inconsistent with, 
        or in mitigation of, the required disclosures shall be used in 
        any advertisement in any medium, and no audio, video, or print 
        technique shall be used that is likely to obscure or detract 
        significantly from the communication of the disclosures.

``SEC. 1012. CIVIL LIABILITY.

    ``(a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided in section 1013, 
any merchant who fails to comply with any requirement of this title 
with respect to any consumer is liable to such consumer as provided for

        the date the last payment was made by the consumer under the 
        rental-purchase agreement.
            ``(2) Recoupment or set-off.--This subsection shall not bar 
        a consumer from asserting a violation of this title in an 
        action to collect an obligation arising from a rental-purchase 
        agreement, which was brought after the end of the 1-year period 
        described in paragraph (1) as a matter of defense by recoupment 
        or set-off in such action, except as otherwise provided by 
        State law.

    ``(a) Individual Cases With Actual Damages.--Any merchant who fails 
to comply with any requirements imposed under section 1010 or 1011 with 
respect to any consumer who suffers actual damage from the violation 
shall be liable to such consumer as provided in section 130.

a pattern or practice of violating any requirement imposed under 
section 1010 or 1011, the Federal Trade Commission or an appropriate

        subsection, a violation that is apparent on the face of a 
        rental-purchase agreement includes, but is not limited to, a 
        disclosure that can be determined to be incomplete or 
        inaccurate from the face of the agreement.

        in a case in which the assignment is involuntary.

        agreement.
    ``(c) Proof of Disclosure.--In an action by or against an assignee, 
the consumer's written acknowledgment of receipt of a disclosure, made 
as part of the rental-purchase agreement, shall be conclusive proof

disclosure had not been made when the assignee acquired the rental-
purchase agreement to which it relates.

``SEC. 1015. REGULATIONS.

    ``(a) In General.--The Board shall prescribe regulations as 
necessary to carry out the purposes of this title, to prevent its 
circumvention, and to facilitate compliance with its requirements.
    ``(b) Model Disclosure Forms.--The Board may publish model 
disclosure forms and clauses for common rental-purchase agreements to 
facilitate compliance with the disclosure requirements of this title 
and to aid the consumer in understanding the transaction by utilizing 
readily understandable language to simplify the technical nature of the 
disclosures. In devising such forms, the Board shall consider the use 
by merchants of data processing or similar automated equipment. Nothing 
in this title may be construed to require a merchant to use any such 
model form or clause prescribed by the Board under this section. A 
merchant shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirement to 
provide disclosure under section 1003(a) if the merchant--
            ``(1) uses any appropriate model form or clause as 
        published by the Board; or

                required by this title; or
                    ``(B) rearranging the format, if in making such 
                deletion or rearranging the format, the merchant does 
                not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful 
                sequence of the disclosure.
    ``(c) Effective Date of Regulations.--Any regulation prescribed by 
the Board, or any amendment or interpretation thereof, shall not be 
effective before the October 1 that follows the date of publication of 
the regulation in final form by at least 6 months. The Board may at its 
discretion lengthen that period of time to permit merchants to adjust 
to accommodate new requirements. The Board may also shorten that period 
of time, notwithstanding the first sentence, if it makes a specific 
finding that such action is necessary to comply with the findings of a 
court or to prevent unfair or deceptive practices. In any case, 
merchants may comply with any newly prescribed disclosure requirement 
prior to its effective date.

    ``(a) Federal Enforcement.--Compliance with the requirements 
imposed under this title shall be enforced under the Federal Trade

requirements imposed under this title shall be deemed a violation of a 
requirement imposed under that Act. All of the functions and powers of

the requirements of this title, irrespective of whether that person is

        not follow such term or provision and shall incur no liability 
        under the law of that State for failure to follow such term or

        greater protection and benefit to the consumer than the 
        protection and benefit provided under this title as determined 
        by the Board, on its own motion or upon the petition of any 
        interested party.

        interest, credit sale, retail installment sale, conditional 
        sale or any other form of consumer credit, or that imputes to a
