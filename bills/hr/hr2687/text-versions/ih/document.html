SEC. 201. SPACE EXPLORATION POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress supports a human exploration program that is 
        not critically dependent on the achievement of milestones by 
        fixed dates and an exploration technology development program 
        to enable lunar human and robotic operations, as described in 
        paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 70502 of title 51, United 
        States Code.
            (2) Congress supports the expansion of permanent human 
        presence beyond low-Earth orbit, in a manner involving 
        international partners where practical.
            (3) Congress remains committed to ensuring that authorized 
        budgets for the human space flight program should allow the 
        Administration to maintain high safety standards.
            (4) Exploration deeper into the solar system should be the 
        core mission of the Administration.
            (5) Congress strongly supports the development of the Space 
        Launch System and the Orion crew capsule as the enabling 
        elements for human exploration, advanced scientific missions, 
        and national security priorities beyond low-Earth orbit.
    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that the 
development of capabilities and technologies necessary for human 
missions to lunar orbit, the surface of the Moon, the surface of Mars, 
and beyond shall be the goal of the Administration's human space flight 
program.

                      Subtitle B--Space Operations

SEC. 211. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The International Space Station is the ideal short-term 
        testbed for future exploration systems development, including 
        long-duration space travel.
            (2) The use of the private market to provide cargo and crew 
        transportation services is currently the most expeditious 
        process to restore domestic access to the International Space 
        Station and low-Earth orbit.
            (3) Government-assured access to low-Earth orbit is 
        paramount to the continued success of the International Space 
        Station and National Laboratory.
            (4) Acquiring and maintaining an operational domestic 
        commercial crew transportation service by the year 2017 is of 
        the utmost importance for the future viability of the 
        International Space Station and National Laboratory.

                the operating costs of the International Space Station.
            (3) Reliance on foreign carriers for crew transfer is 
        unacceptable, and the Nation's human space flight program must 
        acquire the capability to launch United States astronauts on 
        United States rockets from United States soil as soon as is 
        safe and practically possible, whether on Government-owned and 
        operated space transportation systems or privately owned

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat 
        to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid 
        or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the 
        majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, 
        nearly 65,000,000 years ago.
            (2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through 
        the Earth's atmosphere several times in the Earth's history and 
        pose a similar threat in the future.
            (3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been 
        discovered within days of the objects' closest approach to 
        Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate 
        that many large near-Earth objects remain to be discovered.
            (4) The efforts taken to date by the Administration for 
        detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects 
        must continue to fully determine the threat posed by such 
        objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``near-
Earth object'' means an asteroid or comet with a perihelion distance of 
less than 1.3 Astronomical Units from the Sun.
    (c) Near-Earth Object Survey.--The Administrator shall continue to 
discover, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical 
characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 
meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth 
objects to the Earth, pursuant to the George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth 
Object Survey Act (42 U.S.C. 16691). It shall be the goal of the Survey 
program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object 
catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth 
objects) by 2020.
    (d) Warning and Mitigation of Potential Hazards of Near-Earth 
Objects.--Congress reaffirms the policy set forth in section 20102(g) 
of title 51, United States Code (relating to detecting, tracking, 
cataloguing, and characterizing asteroids and comets).
    (e) Program Report.--The Administrator shall transmit to the

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Space Technology Mission Directorate created by the 
        Administration is lacking an organic statutory authorization 
        and in need of congressional direction.
            (2) In order to appropriately prioritize the 
        Administration's resources to accomplish its goals and 
        purposes, the Space Technology Mission Directorate needs to be 
        reorganized as provided in the amendments made by this section.
            (3) Projects, programs, and activities currently within the

                      TITLE VII--POLICY PROVISIONS

SEC. 701. ASTEROID RETRIEVAL MISSION.

    (a) In General.--Consistent with the policy stated in section 
201(b), the Administrator may not fund the development of an asteroid 
retrieval mission to send a robotic spacecraft to a near-Earth asteroid 
for rendezvous, retrieval, and redirection of that asteroid to lunar 
orbit for exploration by astronauts.
    (b) Asteroid Survey.--The Administration may not pursue a program 
to search for asteroids of 20 meters or less in diameter unless the 
survey program described in section 322(c) is at least 90 percent 
complete.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Administrator shall provide to the Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a report on the

        and the NASA Advisory Council that includes a recommendation to 
        Congress on the feasibility of the mission as proposed by the 
        Administration.

SEC. 702. TERMINATION LIABILITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The International Space Station, the Space Launch 
        System, and the Orion crew capsule will enable the Nation to 
        continue operations in low-Earth orbit and to send its 
        astronauts to deep space. As a result of their unique 
        capabilities and their critical contribution to the future of 
        space exploration, these systems have been designated by 
        Congress and the Administration as priority investments.
            (2) While the Space Launch System and the Orion programs, 
        currently under development, have made significant progress, 
        they have not been funded at levels authorized, and as a result 
        congressionally authorized milestones will be delayed by 
        several years.
            (3) In addition, contractors are currently holding program 
        funding, estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of 
        dollars, to cover the potential termination liability should 
        the Government choose to terminate a program for convenience. 
        As a result, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are 
        unavailable for meaningful work on these programs.
            (4) According to the Government Accountability Office, the 
        Administration procures most of its goods and services through 
        contracts, and it terminates very few of them. In fiscal year 
        2010, the Administration terminated 28 of 16,343 active 
        contracts and orders--a termination rate of about 0.17 percent.
            (5) Providing processes requiring congressional action on 
        termination of these high-priority programs would enable 
        contractors to apply taxpayer dollars to making maximum 
        progress in meeting the established technical goals and 
        schedule milestones of these programs.
    (b) NASA Termination Liability.--
            (1) General rule.--Termination liability costs for a 
        covered program shall be provided only pursuant to this 
        subsection.
            (2) Prohibition on reserving funds.--The Administrator may 
        not reserve funds from amounts appropriated for a covered 
        program, and shall direct prime contractors not to reserve 
        funds, for potential termination liability costs with respect 
        to a covered program.
            (3) Intent of congress.--It is the intent of Congress that 
        funds authorized to be appropriated for covered programs be 
        applied in meeting established technical goals and schedule 
        milestones.
            (4) Void contractual provisions.--Any provision in a prime 
        contract entered into before the date of enactment of this Act 
        that provides for the payment of termination liability costs 
        through any means other than as provided in this subsection is 
        hereby declared to be void and unenforceable.
            (5) Congressional action; notice.--
                    (A) Termination for convenience.--The Administrator 
                may not initiate termination for the convenience of the 
                Government of a prime contract on a covered program 
                unless such program termination is authorized or 
                required by a law enacted after the date of enactment 
                of this Act.
                    (B) Termination for cause.--The Administrator shall 
                notify the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology 
                of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
                Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate 
                before initiating termination for cause of a prime 
                contract on a covered program.
            (6) Supplemental appropriation request.--
                    (A) Request.--If the Administrator decides to 
                terminate a prime contract on a covered program, and 
                sufficient unobligated appropriations are not available 
                to cover termination liability costs in the 
                appropriations account that is funding the prime 
                contract being terminated, the Administrator shall 
                provide to Congress a notification that an 
                authorization of appropriations is necessary not later 
                than 120 days in advance of the proposed contract 
                settlement for the covered program.
                    (B) Intent of congress.--It is the intent of 
                Congress to provide additional authorization for 
                appropriations as may be necessary to pay termination 
                liability costs on prime contracts for covered programs 
                if Congress deems it appropriate that the 
                Administration terminate such prime contracts.
            (7) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
