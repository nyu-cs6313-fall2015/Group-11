        loan agreement, a private educational lender shall, upon 
        receiving notification of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner 
        who is jointly liable for the private education loan--

                the loan before deeming the borrower to be in default, 
                changing the terms of the loan, accelerating the 
                repayment terms of the loan, or notifying consumer
