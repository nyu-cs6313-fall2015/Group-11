SEC. 4. LOSS OF ELIGIBILITY.

    If a graduate medical school loses eligibility to participate in 
the loan programs under part D of title IV of the Higher Education Act 
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) due to the enactment of the 
amendments made by section 3, then a student enrolled at such graduate 
medical school on or before the date of enactment of this Act may, 
notwithstanding such loss of eligibility, continue to be eligible to 
receive a loan under such part D while attending such graduate medical 
school in which the student was enrolled upon the date of enactment of 
this Act, subject to the student continuing to meet all applicable 
requirements for satisfactory academic progress, until the earliest 
of--
            (1) withdrawal by the student from the graduate medical 
        school;
            (2) completion of the program of study by the student at 
        the graduate medical school; or
            (3) the fourth June 30 after such loss of eligibility.
