                                 A BILL


 
   To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of 
alternatives for commemorating and interpreting the role of the Buffalo 
   Soldiers in the early years of the National Parks, and for other 
                               purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Buffalo Soldiers in the National 
Parks Study Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the late 19th century and early 20th century, 
        African-American troops who came to be known as the Buffalo 
        Soldiers served in many critical roles in the western United 
        States, including protecting some of the first National Parks.
            (2) Based at the Presidio in San Francisco, Buffalo 
        Soldiers were assigned to Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks 
        where they patrolled the backcountry, built trails, stopped 
        poaching, and otherwise served in the roles later assumed by 
        National Park rangers.
            (3) The public would benefit from having opportunities to 
        learn more about the Buffalo Soldiers in the National Parks and 
        their contributions to the management of National Parks and the 
        legacy of African-Americans in the post-Civil War era.
            (4) As the centennial of the National Park Service in 2016 
        approaches, it is an especially appropriate time to conduct 
        research and increase public awareness of the stewardship role 
        the Buffalo Soldiers played in the early years of the National 
        Parks.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize a study to 
determine the most effective ways to increase understanding and public 
awareness of the critical role that the Buffalo Soldiers played in the 
early years of the National Parks.

SEC. 3. STUDY.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a 
study of alternatives for commemorating and interpreting the role of 
the Buffalo Soldiers in the early years of the National Parks.
    (b) Contents of Study.--The study shall include--
            (1) a historical assessment, based on extensive research, 
        of the Buffalo Soldiers who served in National Parks in the 
        years prior to the establishment of the National Park Service;
            (2) an evaluation of the suitability and feasibility of 
        establishing a national historic trail commemorating the route 
        traveled by the Buffalo Soldiers from their post in the 
        Presidio of San Francisco to Sequoia and Yosemite National 
        Parks and to any other National Parks where they may have 
        served;
            (3) the identification of properties that could meet 
        criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic 
        Places or criteria for designation as National Historic 
        Landmarks;
            (4) an evaluation of appropriate ways to enhance historical 
        research, education, interpretation, and public awareness of 
        the story of the Buffalo Soldiers' stewardship role in the 
        National Parks, including ways to link the story to the 
        development of National Parks and the story of African-American 
        military service following the Civil War; and
            (5) any other matters that the Secretary of the Interior 
        deems appropriate for this study.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 3 years after funds are made available 
for the study, the Secretary of the Interior shall submit to the 
Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report 
containing the study's findings and recommendations.
