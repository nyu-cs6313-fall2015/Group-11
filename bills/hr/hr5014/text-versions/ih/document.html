                                 A BILL


 
To suspend foreign assistance to certain countries related to unlawful 
                               migration.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Illegal Entry Accountability Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

     Congress finds the following:
            (1) The border between the United States and Mexico is not 
        secure on either side, thereby allowing hundreds of thousands 
        of individuals annually to enter the United States illegally.
            (2) The majority of the individuals illegally crossing the 
        United States-Mexico border are from Mexico, Honduras, 
        Guatemala, and El Salvador.
            (3) Today, tens of thousands of unaccompanied alien 
        children are crossing the United States-Mexico border sparking 
        a humanitarian crisis and endangering thousands of children.
            (4) The Department of Homeland Security is spending 
        millions of Americans' tax dollars to process and provide 
        housing and healthcare services to unaccompanied alien 
        children.
            (5) The countries previously listed have failed to secure 
        their borders and have failed to adopt and enforce policies 
        that discourage illegal immigration into the United States.

SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF FOREIGN ASSISTANCE.

    (a) In General.--Upon enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State 
shall immediately suspend all United States foreign assistance to the 
countries of Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Such 
assistance may be reinstated only if Congress determines that Mexico, 
Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador have taken sufficient action to 
mitigate unlawful United States-Mexico border crossings by their 
respective citizens.
    (b) Report.--The Secretary of State shall annually submit to 
Congress a report documenting the measures taken by Mexico, Honduras, 
Guatemala and El Salvador to mitigate unlawful entry into the United 
States by its citizens.
    (c) Exception.--Foreign assistance distributed under the 
International Narcotic Control Law Enforcement program shall not be 
considered under subsection (a).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
