    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law and 
to the extent permitted under State law, a State educational agency may 
allocate grant funds under this part among the local educational 
agencies in the State based on the number of eligible children enrolled 
in the public schools served by each local educational agency and the

            ``(1) Definition.--In this section, the term `eligible 
        child' means a child aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from a family 
        with an income below the poverty level on the basis of the most 
        recent satisfactory data published by the Department of 
        Commerce.
            ``(2) Criteria of poverty.--In determining the families 
        with incomes below the poverty level for the purposes of this 
        section, a State educational agency shall use the criteria of 
        poverty used by the Census Bureau in compiling the most recent 
        decennial census, as the criteria have been updated by 
        increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, 
        published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
    ``(c) Student Enrollment in Public and Private Schools.--
            ``(1) Identification of eligible children.--On an annual 
        basis, on a date to be determined by the State educational 
        agency, each local educational agency that receives grant 
        funding in accordance with subsection (a) shall inform the 
        State educational agency of the number of eligible children 
        enrolled in public schools served by the local educational 
        agency and the State-accredited private schools within the 
        local educational agency's geographic jurisdiction.
            ``(2) Allocation to local educational agencies.--Based on 
        the identification of eligible children in paragraph (1), the 
        State educational agency shall provide to a local educational 
        agency an amount equal to the sum of the amount available for 
        each eligible child in the State multiplied by the number of 
        eligible children identified by the local educational agency 
        under paragraph (1).
            ``(3) Distribution to schools.--Each local educational 
        agency that receives funds under paragraph (2) shall distribute 
        such funds to the public schools served by the local 
        educational agency and State-accredited private schools within 
        the local educational agency's geographic jurisdiction--
                    ``(A) based on the number of eligible children 
                enrolled in such schools; and
                    ``(B) in a manner that would, in the absence of 
                such Federal funds, supplement the funds made available 
                from non-Federal resources for the education of pupils 
                participating in programs under this subpart, and not 
                to supplant such funds.''.
