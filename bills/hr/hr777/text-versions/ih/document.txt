                            ``(i) before filing a complaint alleging a 
                        violation of this title or such a State law, 
                        the plaintiff provides the defendant with a 
                        written notice of the alleged violation by 
                        registered mail;
                            ``(ii) the written notice identifies the

                        elapses after the date on which the plaintiff 
                        provides the written notice;
                            ``(iv) the written notice informs the 
                        defendant that the plaintiff is barred from 
                        filing the complaint until the end of the 
                        remedial period; and
                            ``(v) the complaint states that, as of the 
                        date on which the complaint is filed, the 
                        defendant has not corrected the alleged 
                        violation.
                    ``(B)  Extension of remedial period.--The court may 
                extend the remedial period by not more than 30 days if 
                the defendant applies for such an extension.''.
