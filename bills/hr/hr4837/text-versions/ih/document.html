                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Small Business Act 
   to expand the availability of employee stock ownership plans in S 
                 corporations, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promotion and Expansion of Private 
Employee Ownership Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) on January 1, 1998--nearly 25 years after the Employee 
        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 was enacted and the 
        employee stock ownership plan (hereafter in this section 
        referred to as an ``ESOP'') was created--employees were first 
        permitted to be owners of subchapter S corporations pursuant to 
        the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-
        188);
            (2) with the passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 
        (Public Law 105-34), Congress designed incentives to encourage 
        businesses to become ESOP-owned S corporations;
            (3) since that time, several thousand companies have become 
        ESOP-owned S corporations, creating an ownership interest for 
        several million Americans in companies in every State in the 
        country, in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to 
        technology development to services;
            (4) while estimates show that 40 percent of working 
        Americans have no formal retirement account at all, every 
        United States worker who is an employee-owner of an S 
        corporation company through an ESOP has a valuable qualified 
        retirement savings account;
            (5) recent studies have shown that employees of ESOP-owned 
        S corporations enjoy greater job stability than employees of 
        comparable companies;
            (6) studies also show that employee-owners of S corporation 
        ESOP companies have amassed meaningful retirement savings 
        through their S ESOP accounts that will give them the means to 
        retire with dignity;
            (7) under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) 
        and the regulations promulgated by the Administrator of the 
        Small Business Administration, a small business concern that 
        was eligible under the Small Business Act for the numerous 
        preferences of the Act is denied treatment as a small business 
        concern after an ESOP acquires more than 49 percent of the 
        business, even if the number of employees, the revenue of the 
        small business concern, and the racial, gender, or other 
        criteria used under the Act to determine whether the small 
        business concern is eligible for benefits under the Act remain 
        the same, solely because of the acquisition by the ESOP; and
            (8) it is the goal of Congress to both preserve and foster 
        employee ownership of S corporations through ESOPs.

SEC. 3. DEFERRAL OF TAX FOR CERTAIN SALES OF EMPLOYER STOCK TO EMPLOYEE 
              STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN SPONSORED BY S CORPORATION.

    (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 1042(c)(1) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining qualified securities) is 
amended by striking ``domestic C corporation'' and inserting ``domestic 
corporation''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to sales after the date of the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 4. DEDUCTION FOR INTEREST ON LOAN TO FINANCE PURCHASE OF EMPLOYER 
              SECURITIES BY AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN SPONSORED 
              BY AN S CORPORATION.

                ownership plan to acquire employer securities for the 
                plan.
        For purposes of this paragraph, the term `employer securities'

        similar to the terms of the loan to the S corporation.
            ``(3) Treatment of refinancings.--The term `qualified 
        securities acquisition loan' shall include any loan which is 
        (or is part of a series of loans) used to refinance a loan

        (2)).
            ``(4) Plan must hold more than 50 percent of stock after 
        acquisition or transfer.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A loan shall not be treated as a 
                qualified securities acquisition loan for purposes of 
                this section unless, immediately after an acquisition 
                of employer securities referred to in paragraph (1), 
                the employee stock ownership plan owns more than 50 
                percent of the outstanding stock of the S corporation.
                    ``(B) Failure to retain minimum stock interest.--
                            ``(i) In general.--Subsection (a) shall not 
                        apply to any interest received with respect to 
                        a qualified securities acquisition loan which 
                        is allocable to any period during which the 
                        employee stock ownership plan does not own 
                        stock meeting the requirements of subparagraph 
                        (A).

                        by the Secretary, clause (i) shall not apply to 
                        any period if, within 90 days of the first date 
                        on which the failure occurred (or such longer 
                        period not in excess of 180 days as the 
                        Secretary may prescribe), the plan acquires 
                        stock which results in its meeting the 
                        requirements of subparagraph (A).
                    ``(C) Stock.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the

                purposes under subparagraph (A).

the term `employee stock ownership plan' has the meaning given to such 
term by section 4975(e)(7).''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for part VI of
