  <summary>1/29/2014--Introduced.
Directs the President to direct the Secretary of State to undertake discussions with Israel to identify the steps necessary to include Israel within the list of countries eligible for the Strategic Trade Authorization exception to the requirement for a license for the export, re-export, or in-country transfer of an item subject to certain export controls.

(This exception authorizes exports, re-exports, and transfers [in-country], including releases within a single country of software source code and technology to foreign nationals, in lieu of a license that would otherwise be required. The list of countries eligible for the license exception covers those countries with respect to which the reasons for control that would ordinarily impose the license requirement include national security, chemical or biological weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, regional stability, crime control, and/or significant items authorized for destinations in or nationals of a specified Country Group.)</summary>
