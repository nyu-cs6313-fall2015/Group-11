SEC. 3. NEW FEDERAL TAX SYSTEM.

    (a) Structure.--The Congress hereby declares that any new Federal

            (4) eliminates the bias against savings and investment;
            (5) promotes economic growth and job creation; and
            (6) does not penalize marriage or families.
    (b) Timing of Implementation.--In order to ensure an easy

that any new Federal tax system should be approved by Congress in its 
final form no later than July 4, 2017.

SEC. 4. DELAY OF TERMINATION DATES.

    (a) Two-Thirds Majority Required.--In the House of Representatives 
or the Senate, a bill or joint resolution, amendment, or conference 
report carrying a change of the dates specified in section 2(a) of this 
Act may not be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined 
by a vote of not less than two-thirds of the Members voting, a quorum 
being present.
    (b) Rules of the Senate and House.--The provisions of subsection 
(a) are enacted by the Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power 
of the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as 
such they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, 
respectively, or of that House to which they specifically apply, and 
such rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are 
inconsistent therewith.
