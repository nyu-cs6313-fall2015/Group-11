Establishes a six-month moratorium during which the Financial Stability Oversight Council is prohibited from making a determination under the Financial Stability Act of 2010 that a U.S. nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and be subject to prudential standards, if the Council determines that material financial distress at the company (or its nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of activities) could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.</summary>
