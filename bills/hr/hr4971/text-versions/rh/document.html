to each of the following:

        medical services at the facility in a timely manner.

        veterans to be surveyed is statistically significant; and
            (2) the non-government entity may not conduct such a survey

hearing through the use of the facilities and equipment described in 
subsection (e)(1) or by the appellant personally appearing before a 
Board member or panel.
    ``(B) The Board shall notify the appellant of the determinations of 
the location and type of hearing made under subparagraph (A). Upon 
notification, the appellant may request a different location or type of

the earliest possible date without any undue delay or other prejudice
