SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Money laundering is a serious threat to our national 
        and economic security. The scale, efficiency, and complexity of 
        the U.S. financial system make it a prime target for those who 
        seek to conceal and move the proceeds of illicit activity.
            (2) The spate of recent high-profile enforcement actions 
        against some of the largest and most sophisticated financial 
        institutions raises troubling questions about the effectiveness 
        of U.S. domestic anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism 
        financing regulatory, compliance and enforcement efforts.
            (3) Money launderers have proven to adapt quickly in order 
        to avoid detection. U.S. anti-money laundering laws and 
        regulations must be rigorously reviewed and constantly updated 
        to close loopholes and address the changing tactics employed by 
        bad actors.
            (4) Given the global nature of money laundering and 
        terrorist financing and the increasing interrelatedness of the 
        global financial system, a secure global framework is essential 
        to the integrity of the U.S. financial system.
            (5) Efforts to stanch the flow of illegal money across the 
        world to drug cartels and terrorist organizations should be a 
        top U.S. priority. To achieve this mission, extensive 
        collaboration among financial regulators, the Department of 
        Treasury, the Department of State, the Department of Justice 
        and state and federal law enforcement agencies is required.
            (6) U.S. anti-money laundering laws should meet 
        international standards set by the Financial Action Task Force.
            (7) Without serious consequences for institutions and 
        individuals who fail to protect financial institutions from 
        illicit financial activity - including significant fines, 
        banning individuals from the industry, and prison sentences for 
        those who seek to actively evade anti-money laundering 
        controls, financial institutions and individuals will continue 
        to avoid compliance with U.S. anti-money laundering rules and 
        regulations.
            (8) Effective anti-money laundering programs must emphasize 
        sound corporate governance including business line 
        accountability and clear lines of legal responsibility for 
        individuals, including board members and chief executive 
        officers.
            (9) Avoiding money laundering risks requires an effective 
        anti-money laundering program and a strong institutional 
        compliance culture, with written standards, knowledgeable and 
        adequate staff, strong monitoring processes, effective anti-
        money laundering training, and compensation structures that 
        reward compliance.
            (10) Anti-money laundering deficiencies often reflect 
        weaknesses in the management of a financial firm, which can in 
        turn adversely affect the firm's overall safety and soundness. 
        Failure to account for management deficiencies in this context 
        may perpetuate a false perception of the stability of financial 
        firms.
            (11) Anti-money laundering examinations in recent years at 
        times failed to recognize the cumulative effect of the 
        violations they cited, instead narrowly focusing their 
        attention on individual banking units. The failure to review 
        the cumulative effect of such violations permitted national 
        banks to avoid and delay correcting problems, which allowed 
        massive problems to occur before serious enforcement actions 
        were taken.
            (12) Independent contractors often play a central role in 
        monitoring and auditing the overall adequacy and effectiveness 
        of a bank's compliance program under the Bank Secrecy Act. Any 
        failure to hold these independent entities to the same standard 
        as any other party who participates in the affairs of a bank 
        may jeopardize the efficacy of a bank's anti-money laundering 
        program.
            (13) Collaboration is an essential component of the U.S. 
        strategy against money laundering, and is critical to our 
        national security. U.S. law enforcement agencies are most 
        effective when they work together by sharing information, 
        insight, and data.
            (14) The flow of information related to suspicious activity 
        from financial institutions to law enforcement plays a key role 
        in facilitating the disruption of terrorist networks that seek 
        to harm the United States. The flow of such information depends 
        on a high degree of certainty that financial institutions will 
        be protected from civil liability when sharing such information 
        with federal law enforcement agencies.
            (15) Whistleblower rights and protections play an important 
        role in helping to ensure corporate integrity. Robust 
        protections for whistleblowers and enhanced rewards for 
        informants will incentivize compliance with anti-money 
        laundering rules and procedures, and encourage the provision of 
        valuable information to regulators and law enforcement 
        agencies.

      TITLE VI--SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING CRIMINAL PENALTIES

SEC. 601. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Department of Justice should 
vigorously pursue criminal penalties to the maximum extent of the law, 
including prison sentences, for individuals who willfully violate Bank 
Secrecy Act anti-money laundering laws, thereby exposing the U.S. 
financial system to a wide array of money laundering, drug trafficking 
and terrorism financing risks.

              TITLE VII--STRENGTHENING GLOBAL COMMITMENTS

SEC. 701. INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION.

    The Secretary of the Treasury shall work with the Secretary's 
foreign counterparts, including through the Financial Action Task 
Force, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the United 
Nations, to promote stronger anti-money laundering frameworks and 
enforcement of anti-money laundering laws.

SEC. 702. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING LIST OF COUNTRIES AT HIGH RISK 
              FOR MONEY LAUNDERING.

    It is the sense of Congress that when Treasury identifies countries 
or jurisdictions as a primary money laundering concern under section 
311 of the USA Patriot Act, it should consider--
            (1) countries and jurisdictions identified by the 
        Department of State in its annual International Narcotics 
        Control Strategy Report as Jurisdictions of Primary Concern or 
        jurisdiction's subject to heightened scrutiny;
            (2) whether the Financial Action Task Force has identified 
        a country or jurisdiction as having anti-money laundering or 
        counter-terrorism financing deficiencies and to which 
        countermeasures apply; and
            (3) countries and jurisdictions that have not made 
        sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies identified 
        by the Financial Action Task Force or have not committed to an 
        action plan developed with the Financial Action Task Force to 
        address the deficiencies.
                                 <all>
