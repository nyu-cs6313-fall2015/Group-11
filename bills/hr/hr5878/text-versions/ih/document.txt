    (a) Findings.--Section 2(a) of the International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401(a)) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (3) through (7) as 
        paragraphs (4) through (8), respectively;
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following new 
        paragraph:
            ``(3) International religious freedom means the right of 
        all persons to fully enjoy freedom of religion or belief, as 
        protected by international law, and applies to the holders of 
        all religious beliefs and those who reject religious belief 
        altogether.'';
            (3) in paragraph (5) (as so redesignated)--
                    (A) by striking the second and third sentences and 
                inserting the following: ``More than 76 percent of the 
                world's population live in countries in which religion 
                is restricted in significant ways, either by the 
                government or by societal non-state actors. These 
                limitations severely restrict or prohibit the freedom 
                of people to study, believe, observe, and freely 
                practice the religious faith of their choice.''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following new 
                sentence: ``Other governmental violations include 
                registration laws, laws limiting or prohibiting 
                religious dress or symbols, anti-conversion laws, 
                blasphemy laws, and apostasy laws.'';
            (4) by further redesignating paragraph (7) and (8) (as so 
        redesignated) as paragraphs (9) and (12), respectively;
            (5) by inserting after paragraph (6) the following new 
        paragraphs:
            ``(7) In addition to governments, non-state actors severely 
        violate freedom of religion or belief. These actors include 
        individuals, mobs, vigilante groups, anti-government 
        insurgents, militant organizations, and recognized terrorist 
        groups. In those cases in which governments' legal systems 
        promote intolerance, non-state actors often act unilaterally to 
        enforce these biased measures.
            ``(8) Over the past 15 years, the global landscape for 
        religious freedom has deteriorated. While authoritarian 
        governments continue to persecute individuals, unchecked 
        majoritarianism against religious minorities and increasing 
        acts of violence by religious extremists against any who 
        challenge their ideologies are troubling new threats to this 
        fundamental freedom. Such violence includes the 2011 
        assassination of Pakistan's Minister of Minority Affairs, 
        Shahbaz Bhatti, an advocate for religious freedom.'';
            (6) by inserting after paragraph (9) (as so redesignated) 
        the following new paragraphs:
            ``(10) Freedom of religion or belief also is central to a 
        country's stability and security. Religious freedom abuses are 
        linked to abuses of other human rights, and to instability and 
        violent extremism. Wherever religious freedom is abused, peace 
        and security may be threatened, affecting societies and in some 
        cases the security of the United States. As such, religious 
        freedom merits consideration with economic, security, and other 
        concerns.
            ``(11) The United States must do more to promote freedom of 
        religion or belief overseas. This fundamental freedom is under 
        serious and sustained pressure across much of the globe.''; and
            (7) by striking paragraph (12) (as so redesignated) and 
        inserting the following:
            ``(12) Congress has recognized and denounced acts of 
        religious persecution through the passage of the following 
        measures and adoption of the following resolutions:

                is a product of Burma (Myanmar) until the President 
                determines and certifies to Congress that Burma has met 
                certain conditions, including the releasing of all 
                political prisoners and permitting the peaceful

                that U.S. officials and representatives should draw 
                international attention to Iran's violations of human
