                                 A BILL


 
   To increase Federal Pell Grants for the children of fallen police 
       officers, firefighters, and other public safety officers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Children of Fallen Heroes 
Scholarship Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The year 2012 was a deadly year for law enforcement 
        officers, with 126 men and women killed in the line of duty. 
        That year, 83 firefighters lost their lives and 21 emergency 
        medical services providers suffered fatalities in the line of 
        duty.
            (2) Congress recognizes the sacrifice of the families of 
        fallen public safety officers.
            (3) The financial loss for a family with children could be 
        detrimental for decades.
            (4) Families who have given the ultimate sacrifice deserve 
        the support of the American people as their children pursue 
        higher education.

            ``(i) whose parent or guardian--
                    ``(I) was actively serving as a police officer, 
                firefighter, or other public safety officer; and
                    ``(II) died as a result of performing a public 
                safety service; and
            ``(ii) who was 18 years or less, or was enrolled as a full-

                within the jurisdiction of such State or political 
                subdivision;
                    ``(II) is an emergency medical services provider

                including an emergency medical technician or paramedic; 
                or
                    ``(III) is a member of a qualified volunteer 
                emergency response organization who provides 
                firefighting services or emergency medical services; 
                and
            ``(ii) the term `qualified volunteer emergency response 
        organization' means any volunteer organization that--
                    ``(I) is organized and operated to provide 
                firefighting or emergency medical services for persons 
                in the State or political subdivision, as the case may 
                be; and
                    ``(II) is required (by written agreement) by the 
                State or political subdivision to furnish firefighting 
                or emergency medical services in such State or 
                political subdivision.''.
