Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act - Amends the Antiquities Act of 1906 to subject national monument declarations by the President to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).

Prohibits: (1) the President from making more than one such declaration in a state during any presidential four-year term of office without an express Act of Congress, or (2) such a declaration from including private property without the informed written consent of the affected private property owner.

Requires such a declaration: (1) to be considered a major federal action under NEPA, except if it affects 5,000 acres or less; (2) to be categorically excluded under NEPA and to expire three years after the date of the declaration (unless specifically designated as a monument by federal law) if it affects 5,000 acres or less; and (3) to be followed by a feasibility study that includes an estimate of the costs associated with managing the monument in perpetuity, including any loss of federal and state revenue, and the benefits associated with managing the monument in perpetuity.

 Allows a declaration to become permanent if: (1) it is specifically designated as a monument by federal statute, or (2) the President follows the review process under NEPA.

Prohibits this Act from being construed to increase the amount of funds that are authorized to be appropriated.</summary>
