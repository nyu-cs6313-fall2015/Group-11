                    ``(C) that is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, 
                by an industry, trade, or service group or association, 
                and whose primary purpose is to provide insurance to 
                cover the risks to any member in such group or

                            ``(i) a risk retention group'';
                    (B) by striking the period at the end and inserting 
                ``; or''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
