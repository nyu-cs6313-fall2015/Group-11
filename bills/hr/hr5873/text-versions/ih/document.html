    (a) Carbon Dioxide Emissions Report.--Not later than the first ____ 
occurring at least 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator shall transmit to the Internal Revenue Service and make 
public a report on the total life-cycle emissions of carbon dioxide for 
each covered transportation fuel, expressed in tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions per barrel of fuel or an appropriate alternate measure. Such 
report shall take into account the differences in carbon dioxide 
emissions per barrel of fuel across different regions and countries due 
to means of resource extraction and production, transportation, and 
other factors, with each covered transportation fuel being as 
regionally specific as determined by the Administrator.
    (b) Addition of Covered Transportation Fuel.--The Administrator 
shall--
            (1) from time to time determine which transportation fuels 
        have achieved a sufficient share of the on-road transportation 
        fuel market to warrant being considered a covered 
        transportation fuel, and
            (2) update the report transmitted under subsection (a), and 
        transmit such updated report to Congress, with the 
        specifications on the total life-cycle emissions of carbon 
        dioxide and other greenhouse gases for each fuel newly 
        determined under paragraph (1) to be considered a covered 
        transportation fuel.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the 
        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
            (2) Biofuel.--The term ``biofuel'' means the biofuel 
        component of a transportation fuel.
            (3) Covered transportation fuel.--The term ``covered 
        transportation fuel'' means gasoline, diesel fuel, biofuel, and 
        any other fuel the Administrator determines has achieved a 
        sufficient share of the on-road transportation fuel market to 
        warrant regulation under this section.
            (4) Greenhouse gas.--The term ``greenhouse gas'' has the 
        same meaning given the term in section 211(o)(1) of the Clean 
        Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(o)(1)).
            (5) Life-cycle emissions.--The term ``life-cycle 
        emissions'' means emissions from all activities included in the 
        production, transport, storage, and use of a fuel, including 
        land use changes, means of resource extraction and production, 
        transportation systems, and leakages.
