SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Trade Secrets Protection Act of

SEC. 2. FEDERAL JURISDICTION FOR THEFT OF TRADE SECRETS.

    (a) In General.--Section 1836 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:
    ``(b) Private Civil Actions.--
            ``(1) In general.--An owner of a trade secret may bring a 
        civil action under this subsection if the person is aggrieved 
        by a misappropriation of a trade secret that is related to a 
        product or service used in, or intended for use in, interstate 
        or foreign commerce.
            ``(2) Civil seizure.--
                    ``(A) In general.--
                            ``(i) Application.--Based on an affidavit 
                        or verified complaint satisfying the 
                        requirements of this paragraph, the court may, 
                        upon ex parte application, issue an order 
                        providing for the seizure of property necessary 
                        to preserve evidence in a civil action brought 
                        under paragraph (1) or to prevent the 
                        propagation or dissemination of the trade 
                        secret that is the subject of the action.

                        court may not grant an application under clause 
                        (i) unless the court finds that it clearly 
                        appears from specific facts that--
                                    ``(I) an order issued pursuant to 
                                Rule 65(b) of the Federal Rules of

                                achieve the purpose of this paragraph 
                                because the party to which the order 
                                would be issued would evade, avoid, or 
                                otherwise not comply with such an 
                                order;

                                the person against whom seizure would 
                                be ordered of granting the application

                                reasonable under the circumstances,

                                matter is to be seized;

                                court, if the applicant were to proceed 
                                on notice to such person; and

                                publicized the requested seizure.

                        property in a manner that minimizes any 
                        interruption of the business operations of 
                        third parties and, to the extent possible, does 
                        not interrupt those legitimate business 
                        operations of the person accused of 
                        misappropriating the trade secret that are 
                        unrelated to the trade secret that has 
                        allegedly been misappropriated;

                        including during the seizure, and prohibiting 
                        any copies, in whole or in part, of the seized 
                        property, to prevent undue damage to the party 
                        against whom the order has issued or others,

                        harmed by the order may move the court at any 
                        time to dissolve or modify the order after 
                        giving notice to the applicant who obtained the

                        damages as any person may be entitled to 
                        recover as a result of a wrongful or excessive 
                        seizure or wrongful or excessive attempted 
                        seizure under this paragraph.

                take appropriate action to protect the person against 
                whom an order under this paragraph is directed from 
                publicity, by or at the behest of the person obtaining 
                the order, about such order and any seizure under such 
                order.
                    ``(D) Materials in custody of court.--Any materials 
                seized under this paragraph shall be taken into the

                material from physical and electronic access during the 
                seizure and while in the custody of the court.
                    ``(E) Service of order.--The court shall order that 
                service of a copy of the order under this paragraph 
                shall be made by a Federal law enforcement officer, or 
                may be made by a State or local law enforcement 
                officer, who, upon making service, shall carry out the 
                seizure under the order.
                    ``(F) Action for damage caused by wrongful 
                seizure.--A person who suffers damage by reason of a 
                wrongful or excessive seizure under this paragraph has 
                a cause of action against the applicant for the order 
                under which such seizure was made, and shall be 
                entitled to the same relief as is provided under 
                section 34(d)(11) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 
                U.S.C. 1116(d)(11)). The security posted with the court 
                under subparagraph (B)(v) shall not limit the recovery 
                of third parties for damages.
            ``(3) Remedies.--In a civil action brought under this 
        subsection with respect to the misappropriation of a trade 
        secret, a court may--

                        liability for a reasonable royalty for the 
                        misappropriator's unauthorized disclosure or 
                        use of the trade secret;

                damages awarded under subparagraph (B); and
                    ``(D) if a claim of the misappropriation is made in 
                bad faith, a motion to terminate an injunction is made

                willfully and maliciously misappropriated, award 
                reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party.
    ``(c) Jurisdiction.--The district courts of the United States shall 
have original jurisdiction of civil actions brought under this section.
    ``(d) Period of Limitations.--A civil action under subsection (b) 
may not be commenced later than 5 years after the date on which the 
misappropriation with respect to which the action would relate is 
discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been 
discovered. For purposes of this subsection, a continuing 
misappropriation constitutes a single claim of misappropriation.''.
    (b) Definitions.--Section 1839 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``and'' at the end;
