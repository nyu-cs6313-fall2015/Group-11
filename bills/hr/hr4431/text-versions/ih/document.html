                                 A BILL


 
 To provide that, if emergency unemployment compensation is extended, 
      prospective benefits shall be subject to gradual reduction.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CONDITION.

    In the event that a law extending title IV of the Supplemental 
Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-252; 26 U.S.C. 3304) is 
enacted on or after the date of enactment of this Act, then, effective 
with respect to emergency unemployment compensation payable for each 
week beginning on or after such date of enactment or, if later, the 
effective date of the extension (the first such week, in the case of 
any individual, to be referred to as the individual's ``initial post-
extension week''), section 2 shall apply.

SEC. 2. REDUCTION.

    Notwithstanding any provision of title IV of the Supplemental 
Appropriations Act, 2008, the amount of emergency unemployment 
compensation payable to any individual under such title shall--
            (1) for the first week of unemployment following the 
        initial post-extension week described in section 1, be equal 
        to--
                    (A) the amount that would otherwise be payable,
                    (B) reduced by 5 percent; and
            (2) for each week of unemployment subsequent to the week of 
        unemployment to which paragraph (1) applies, be equal to--
                    (A) the amount that would otherwise be payable,
                    (B) reduced by--
                            (i) the percentage reduction applicable 
                        under this section to the individual's 
                        preceding week of unemployment,
                            (ii) increased by 5 percentage points,
                but not below zero.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
