        include a therapeutic response, where appropriate;

        each victim of allergy bullying to report such bullying to 
        school personnel; and

aggressive behavior by a student toward another student with an allergy 
and includes--
            ``(1) a real or perceived imbalance of power due to such 
        other student's allergy, such as physical strength, access to 
        embarrassing information, or popularity, to control or harm 
        such other student; and
            ``(2) actions such as making threats, spreading rumors,
