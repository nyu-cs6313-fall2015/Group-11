Requires the LEAs to submit an annual written certification to their state that they have established and implemented such policy.\n\nDefines \"allergy bullying\" as unwanted, aggressive behavior by a student toward another student with an allergy, including: (1) a real or perceived imbalance of power due to such other student's allergy; and (2) actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, making physical or verbal attacks, and excluding such other student from a group on purpose."
