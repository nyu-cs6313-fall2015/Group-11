                                 A BILL


 
         To repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sunset to the Authorization for Use 
of Military Force Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On September 11, 2001, the United States and its 
        citizens were victims of the worst terrorist attacks in world 
        history.
            (2) The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were planned, 
        financed, and executed by al Qaeda, a terrorist organization 
        led by Osama bin Laden.
            (3) Al Qaeda was based in Afghanistan throughout the period 
        leading up to the attacks, and the three previous attacks 
        against United States targets, the 1993 World Trade Center 
        bombing, the 1998 East Africa bombings, and the 2000 attack on 
        the USS Cole, were planned by al Qaeda central.
            (4) From 1996 to 2001, the Taliban government of 
        Afghanistan knowingly harbored al Qaeda, and was complicit in 
        its plots against the United States, and that al Qaeda, in 
        turn, supported the Taliban, including sponsoring and training 
        the elite Arab 55th Brigade of the Taliban Army.
            (5) Following the September 11, 2001, attacks Congress 
        passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 
        107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) to provide the President with 
        requisite authorization to use ``force against those nations, 
        organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, 
        committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 
        September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, 
        in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism 
        against the United States by such nations, organizations or 
        persons''.
            (6) Following passage of Public Law 107-40, and consistent 
        with its purpose, the United States invaded Afghanistan, 
        resulting in the toppling of the Taliban government and the 
        routing of al Qaeda forces in the country.
            (7) Osama bin Laden and other senior al Qaeda leaders left 
        Afghanistan in the wake of the United States invasion, with 
        many fleeing to neighboring Pakistan.
            (8) Many of al Qaeda's senior leaders, including Osama bin 
        Laden, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abu Yahya al-Libi, and Abu Hamza 
        Rabia have either been killed or captured by United States 
        forces in the years since the 2001 terrorist attacks.
            (9) Intelligence experts now describe al Qaeda's core as 
        largely decimated, and Director of National Intelligence James 
        Clapper told Congress in early 2013, that al Qaeda's core had 
        been so ``degraded'' that it is ``probably unable to carry out 
        complex, large-scale attacks in the West''.
            (10) Congress never intended and did not authorize a 
        perpetual war.
            (11) With the withdrawal of United States combat troops 
        from Afghanistan and the transition to Afghan national security 
        forces at the end of 2014, Public Law 107-40, which was focused 
        on the September 11th attacks and those directly responsible, 
        will have largely served its purpose.
            (12) The homeland and the American people face new threats 
        from individuals, entities, and organizations that may 
        affiliate with al Qaeda, or share its ideology and its 
        determination to attack Americans, but which may not be 
        connected to the September 11, 2001, attacks or those who 
        carried them out to a degree sufficient to be covered by Public 
        Law 107-40.
            (13) Even after the expiration of Public Law 107-40, there 
        is likely to remain the need to defend against specific 
        networks of violent extremists, including al Qaeda and its 
        affiliates, that threaten the United States, and the Congress 
        urges the President to work with the legislative branch to 
        secure whatever new authorities may be required to meet the 
        threat and comply with the Constitution, the War Powers 
        Resolution, and the law of war.

SEC. 3. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE.

    Effective on December 31, 2014, the Authorization for Use of 
Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is hereby 
repealed.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
