  To require approval for the construction, connection, operation, or 
 maintenance of oil or natural gas pipelines or electric transmission 
facilities at the national boundary of the United States for the import 
  or export of oil, natural gas, or electricity to or from Canada or

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``North American Energy Infrastructure 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDING.

    Congress finds that the United States should establish a more 
uniform, transparent, and modern process for the construction, 
connection, operation, and maintenance of oil and natural gas pipelines 
and electric transmission facilities for the import and export of oil 
and natural gas and the transmission of electricity to and from Canada 
and Mexico, in pursuit of a more secure and efficient North American 
energy market.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF CERTAIN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AT THE 
              NATIONAL BOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Authorization.--Except as provided in subsection (c) and 
section 7, no person may construct, connect, operate, or maintain a 
cross-border segment of an oil pipeline or electric transmission 
facility for the import or export of oil or the transmission of 
electricity to or from Canada or Mexico without obtaining a certificate 
of crossing for the construction, connection, operation, or maintenance 
of the cross-border segment under this section.
    (b) Certificate of Crossing.--
            (1) Requirement.--Not later than 120 days after final 
        action is taken under the National Environmental Policy Act of 
        1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) with respect to a cross-border 
        segment for which a request is received under this section, the 
        relevant official identified under paragraph (2), in 
        consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, shall issue a 
        certificate of crossing for the cross-border segment unless the 
        relevant official finds that the construction, connection, 
        operation, or maintenance of the cross-border segment is not in 
        the public interest of the United States.
            (2) Relevant official.--The relevant official referred to 
        in paragraph (1) is--
                    (A) the Secretary of State with respect to oil

            (3) Additional requirement for electric transmission 
        facilities.--In the case of a request for a certificate of 
        crossing for the construction, connection, operation, or 
        maintenance of a cross-border segment of an electric 
        transmission facility, the Secretary of Energy shall require, 
        as a condition of issuing the certificate of crossing for the 
        request under paragraph (1), that the cross-border segment of 
        the electric transmission facility be constructed, connected, 
        operated, or maintained consistent with all applicable policies 
        and standards of--
                    (A) the Electric Reliability Organization and the

                Independent System Operator with operational or 
                functional control over the cross-border segment of the 
                electric transmission facility.
    (c) Exclusions.--This section shall not apply to any construction, 
connection, operation, or maintenance of a cross-border segment of an 
oil pipeline or electric transmission facility for the import or export 
of oil or the transmission of electricity to or from Canada or Mexico--
            (1) if the cross-border segment is operating for such 
        import, export, or transmission as of the date of enactment of 
        this Act;
            (2) if a permit described in section 6 for such
