SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Sean Goldman, a United States citizen and resident of 
        New Jersey, was abducted from the United States in 2004 and 
        separated from his father, David Goldman, who spent nearly six 
        years battling for the return of his son from Brazil before 
        Sean was finally returned to Mr. Goldman's custody on December 
        24, 2009.
            (2) The Department of State's Office of Children's Issues, 
        which serves as the Central Authority of the United States for 
        the purposes of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects 
        of International Child Abduction, has received thousands of 
        requests since 2007 for assistance in the return to the United 
        States of children who have been abducted by a parent or other 
        legal guardian to another country. For a variety of reasons 
        reflecting the significant obstacles to the recovery of 
        abducted children, as well as the legal and factual complexity 
        involving such cases, not all cases are reported to the Central 
        Authority of the United States.
            (3) The number of outgoing international child abductions 
        reported to the Central Authority of the United States has 
        increased substantially since 2006.
            (4) Only about half of the children abducted from the 
        United States to countries with which the United States enjoys 
        reciprocal obligations under the Hague Abduction Convention are 
        returned to the United States.
            (5) The United States and Convention countries have 
        expressed their desire, through the Hague Abduction Convention, 
        ``to protect children internationally from the harmful effects 
        of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish 
        procedures to ensure their prompt return to the State of their 
        habitual residence, as well as to secure protection for rights 
        of access.''.
            (6) Compliance by the United States and Convention 
        countries depends on the actions of their designated central 
        authorities, the performance of their judiciaries as reflected 
        in the legal process and decisions rendered to enforce or 
        effectuate the Hague Abduction Convention, and the ability and 
        willingness of their law enforcement to insure the swift 
        enforcement of orders rendered pursuant to the Hague Abduction 
        Convention.
            (7) The Central Authority of the United States reports that 
        nearly 40 percent of abduction cases and access cases involve 
        children taken from the United States to countries with which 
        the United States does not have Hague Abduction Convention 
        obligations or other agreements relating to the resolution of 
        abduction cases and access cases.
            (8) According to the Department of State's April 2010 
        Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil 
        Aspects of International Child Abduction, ``parental child 
        abduction jeopardizes the child and has substantial long-term 
        consequences for both the child and the left-behind parent.''.
            (9) Abducted children are at risk of serious emotional and 
        psychological problems and have been found to experience 
        anxiety, eating problems, nightmares, mood swings, sleep 
        disturbances, aggressive behavior, resentment, guilt and 
        fearfulness, and as adults may struggle with identity issues, 
        personal relationships, and parenting.
            (10) Left-behind parents may encounter substantial 
        psychological and emotional problems, and few have the 
        extraordinary financial resources necessary to pursue 
        individual civil or criminal remedies in both the United States 
        and a foreign country, even where available, or to engage in 
        repeated foreign travel to attempt to procure the return of 
        their children by evoking diplomatic and humanitarian remedies.
            (11) Left-behind parents who are military parents may be 
        unable to leave their military duties to pursue multinational 
        litigation or take leave to attend multiple court proceedings, 
        and foreign authorities may not schedule proceedings to 
        accommodate such duties.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should set a strong example for Convention countries in the 
timely location and return of abducted children in the United States 
whose habitual residence is not the United States.
    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) protect children whose habitual residence is the United 
        States from the harmful effects of abduction and to assist 
        left-behind parents to have access to their abducted child in a 
        safe and predictable manner, wherever the child is located, 
        while an abduction case is pending;
            (2) provide left-behind parents, including military 
        parents, their advocates, and judges the information they need 
        to enhance the resolution of abduction cases and access cases 
        through established legal procedures, the tools for assessing 
        the risk of abduction and denial of rights of access, and the 
        practical means for overcoming obstacles to recovering an 
        abducted child;
            (3) establish measured, effective, and predictable actions 
        to be undertaken by the President on behalf of abducted 
        children whose habitual residence is the United States at the 
        time of the abduction;
            (4) promote an international consensus that it is in the 
        interest of children to have any issues related to their care 
        and custody determined in the country of their habitual 
        residence;
            (5) provide the necessary training for officials of the 
        United States Armed Forces and the Department of Defense to 
        establish policies and provide services to military parents 
        that address the unique circumstances of abductions and 
        violations of rights of access that may occur with regard to 
        military dependent children; and
            (6) encourage the effective implementation of international 
        mechanisms, particularly those established pursuant to the 
        Hague Abduction Convention, to achieve reciprocity in the 
        resolution of abductions and to protect children from the 
        harmful effects of an abduction.
