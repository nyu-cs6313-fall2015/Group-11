_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
      To establish the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Western Hemisphere Drug Policy 
Commission Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
        Services Administration's (SAMHSA) National Survey on Drug Use 
        and Health, in 2012 in the United States, an estimated 
        23,900,000 persons age 12 or older were current drug users. 
        There were an estimated 1,600,000 users of cocaine, 440,000 
        users of methamphetamine, 335,000 users of heroin, 18,900,000 
        users of marijuana, and 6,800,000 non-medical users of 
        prescription-type drugs.
            (2) On September 13, 2013, President Barack Obama 
        identified 22 countries as major drug transit or major illicit 
        drug producing countries. Of these, 17 are located in the 
        Western Hemisphere. They are The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, 
        Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El 
        Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, 
        Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.
            (3) Nearly all cocaine consumed in the United States 
        originates in the Andean countries of Bolivia, Colombia, and 
        Peru and most of the heroin consumed in the United States 
        originates in Colombia and Mexico. The cultivation, production 
        and trafficking of cocaine and heroin generate violence, 
        instability, and corruption.
            (4) In the transit countries of Central America, Mexico, 
        Venezuela, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and other 
        Caribbean countries, drug trafficking is central to the growing 
        strength of organized criminals to threaten local and national 
        law enforcement, political institutions, citizen security, rule 
        of law, and United States security and interests.
            (5) Drug trafficking-related violence continues unabated in 
        Mexico. According to Government of Mexico estimates, some 
        70,000 people died in Mexico and 25,000 people disappeared as a 
        result of drug trafficking and organized crime-related violence 
        between December 2006 and December 2012. According to analysts, 
        more than 11,500 more people died in Mexico in 2013 due to the 
        violence.
            (6) Foreign Terrorist Organizations and their supporters in 
        the Western Hemisphere, including the Revolutionary Armed 
        Forces of Colombia (FARC) and Hezbollah, have used drug 
        trafficking to finance their activities.
            (7) The United States obligated roughly $15,700,000,000 
        ($18,600,000,000 in constant 2012 dollars) for counternarcotics 
        programs in Latin America and the Caribbean between 1980 and 
        2012.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.
