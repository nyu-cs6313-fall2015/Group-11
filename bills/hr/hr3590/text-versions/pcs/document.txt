SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Target Practice and Marksmanship 
Training Support Act''.

SEC. 202. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the use of firearms and archery equipment for target 
        practice and marksmanship training activities on Federal land 
        is allowed, except to the extent specific portions of that land 
        have been closed to those activities;
            (2) in recent years preceding the date of enactment of this 
        Act, portions of Federal land have been closed to target 
        practice and marksmanship training for many reasons;
            (3) the availability of public target ranges on non-Federal 
        land has been declining for a variety of reasons, including 
        continued population growth and development near former ranges;
            (4) providing opportunities for target practice and 
        marksmanship training at public target ranges on Federal and 
        non-Federal land can help--
                    (A) to promote enjoyment of shooting, recreational, 
                and hunting activities; and
                    (B) to ensure safe and convenient locations for 
                those activities;
            (5) Federal law in effect on the date of enactment of this 
        Act, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act 
        (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides Federal support for 
        construction and expansion of public target ranges by making 
        available to States amounts that may be used for construction, 
        operation, and maintenance of public target ranges; and
            (6) it is in the public interest to provide increased 
        Federal support to facilitate the construction or expansion of 
        public target ranges.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to facilitate the 
construction and expansion of public target ranges, including ranges on 
Federal land managed by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land 
Management.

SEC. 203. DEFINITION OF PUBLIC TARGET RANGE.

    In this title, the term ``public target range'' means a specific 
location that--
            (1) is identified by a governmental agency for recreational 
        shooting;

            (3) may be supervised; and
            (4) may accommodate archery or rifle, pistol, or shotgun 
        shooting.

    This title may be cited as the ``Recreational Lands Self-Defense 
Act''.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Second Amendment to the Constitution provides that 
        ``the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be 
        infringed''.
            (2) Section 327.13 of title 36, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, provides that, except in special circumstances, 
        ``possession of loaded firearms, ammunition, loaded projectile 
        firing devices, bows and arrows, crossbows, or other weapons is 
        prohibited'' at water resources development projects 
        administered by the Secretary of the Army.
            (3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent 
        individuals complying with Federal and State laws from 
        exercising the second amendment rights of the individuals while 
        at such water resources development projects.
            (4) The Federal laws should make it clear that the second 
        amendment rights of an individual at a water resources 
        development project should not be infringed.
    (b) Protecting the Right of Individuals To Bear Arms at Water 
Resources Development Projects.--The Secretary of the Army shall not 
promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from 
possessing a firearm including an assembled or functional firearm at a 
water resources development project covered under section 327.0 of 
title 36, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of 
enactment of this Act), if--
            (1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from 
        possessing the firearm; and
            (2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the

        industries have generated billions of dollars of critical 
        funding for fish and wildlife conservation, research, and 
        management by providing revenues from purchases of fishing and 
        hunting licenses, permits, and stamps, as well as excise taxes 
        on fishing, hunting, and shooting equipment that have generated 
        billions of dollars of critical funding for fish and wildlife 
        conservation, research, and management;
            (6) recreational shooting is also an important and 
        traditional activity in which millions of Americans 
        participate, safe recreational shooting is a valid use of 
        Federal public lands, including the establishment of safe and 
        convenient shooting ranges on such lands, and participation in 
        recreational shooting helps recruit and retain hunters and 
        contributes to wildlife conservation;
            (7) opportunities to recreationally fish, hunt, and shoot 
        are declining, which depresses participation in these 
        traditional activities, and depressed participation adversely 
        impacts fish and wildlife conservation and funding for 
        important conservation efforts; and
            (8) the public interest would be served, and our citizens' 
        fish and wildlife resources benefitted, by action to ensure 
        that opportunities are facilitated to engage in fishing and 
        hunting on Federal public land as recognized by Executive Order 
        No. 12962, relating to recreational fisheries, and Executive 
        Order No. 13443, relating to facilitation of hunting heritage 
        and wildlife conservation.

    (a) In General.--Subject to valid existing rights and subsection 
(g), and cooperation with the respective State fish and wildlife 
agency, Federal public land management officials shall exercise 
authority under existing law, including provisions regarding land use 
planning, to facilitate use of and access to Federal public lands, 
including National Monuments, Wilderness Areas, Wilderness Study Areas, 
and lands administratively classified as wilderness eligible or 
suitable and primitive or semi-primitive areas, for fishing, sport 
hunting, and recreational shooting, except as limited by--
            (1) statutory authority that authorizes action or 
        withholding action for reasons of national security, public 
        safety, or resource conservation;
            (2) any other Federal statute that specifically precludes 
        recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting on specific Federal

            (3) discretionary limitations on recreational fishing, 
        hunting, and shooting determined to be necessary and reasonable 
        as supported by the best scientific evidence and advanced 
        through a transparent public process.
    (b) Management.--Consistent with subsection (a), the head of each 
Federal public land management agency shall exercise its land 
management discretion--
            (1) in a manner that supports and facilitates recreational 
        fishing, hunting, and shooting opportunities;
            (2) to the extent authorized under applicable State law; 
        and
            (3) in accordance with applicable Federal law.
    (c) Planning.--
            (1) Evaluation of effects on opportunities to engage in 
        recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting.--Federal public 
        land planning documents, including land resources management

        recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting.
            (2) No major federal action.--No action taken under this 
        title, or under section 4 of the National Wildlife Refuge 
        System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd), either 
        individually or cumulatively with other actions involving 
        Federal public lands or lands managed by the United States Fish 
        and Wildlife Service, shall be considered to be a major Federal 
        action significantly affecting the quality of the human 
        environment, and no additional identification, analysis, or

        effects, is necessary or required.
            (3) Other activity not considered.--Federal public land 
        management officials are not required to consider the existence 
        or availability of recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting 
        opportunities on adjacent or nearby public or private lands in 
        the planning for or determination of which Federal public lands 
        are open for these activities or in the setting of levels of 
        use for these activities on Federal public lands, unless the 
        combination or coordination of such opportunities would enhance 
        the recreational fishing, hunting, or shooting opportunities 
        available to the public.
    (d) Federal Public Lands.--
            (1) Lands open.--Lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau

                    (A) In general.--The head of each Federal agency 
                shall use his or her authorities in a manner consistent 
                with this title and other applicable law, to--
                            (i) lease or permit use of lands under the 
                        jurisdiction of the agency for shooting ranges; 
                        and
                            (ii) designate specific lands under the 
                        jurisdiction of the agency for recreational 
                        shooting activities.
                    (B) Limitation on liability.--Any designation under 
                subparagraph (A)(ii) shall not subject the United 
                States to any civil action or claim for monetary 
                damages for injury or loss of property or personal 
                injury or death caused by any activity occurring at or 
                on such designated lands.
    (e) Necessity in Wilderness Areas and ``Within and Supplemental 
to'' Wilderness Purposes.--
            (1) Minimum requirements for administration.--The provision 
        of opportunities for hunting, fishing and recreational 
        shooting, and the conservation of fish and wildlife to provide 
        sustainable use recreational opportunities on designated 
        Federal wilderness areas shall constitute measures necessary to 
        meet the minimum requirements for the administration of the 
        wilderness area, provided that the provision of opportunities 
        for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting under the 
        authority of this title shall not authorize or facilitate 
        commodity development, use, or extraction, motorized 
        recreational access, road construction or maintenance, or use 
        that is not otherwise allowed under the Wilderness Act (16 
        U.S.C. 1131 et seq.) within designated wilderness areas.
            (2) Application of wilderness act.--Provisions of the 
        Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), stipulating that 
        wilderness purposes are ``within and supplemental to'' the 
        purposes of the underlying Federal land unit are reaffirmed. 
        When seeking to carry out fish and wildlife conservation 
        programs and projects or provide fish and wildlife dependent 
        recreation opportunities on designated wilderness areas, the 
        head of each Federal agency shall implement these supplemental 
        purposes so as to facilitate, enhance, or both, but not to 
        impede the underlying Federal land purposes when seeking to 
        carry out fish and wildlife conservation programs and projects 
        or provide fish and wildlife dependent recreation opportunities 
        in designated wilderness areas, provided that the provision of 
        opportunities for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting 
        under the authority of this title shall not authorize or 
        facilitate commodity development, use or extraction, motorized 
        recreational access, road construction or maintenance, or use 
        that is not otherwise allowed under the Wilderness Act (16 
        U.S.C. 1131 et seq.) within designated wilderness areas.
    (f) Report.--Beginning on the second October 1 after the date of 
the enactment of this Act and biennially on October 1 thereafter, the 
head of each Federal agency who has authority to manage Federal public 
land on which fishing, hunting, or recreational shooting occurs shall 
submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of 
the Senate a report that describes--
            (1) any Federal public land administered by the agency head 
        that was closed to recreational fishing, sport hunting, or 
        shooting at any time during the preceding year; and
            (2) the reason for the closure.
    (g) Closures or Significant Restrictions of 640 or More Acres.--
            (1) In general.--Other than closures established or 
        prescribed by land planning actions referred to in subsection 
        (d) or emergency closures described in paragraph (3) of this 
        subsection, a permanent or temporary withdrawal, change of 
        classification, or change of management status of Federal 
        public land that effectively closes or significantly restricts 
        640 or more contiguous acres of Federal public land to access 
        or use for fishing or hunting or activities related to fishing, 
        hunting, or both, shall take effect only if, before the date of 
        withdrawal or change, the head of the Federal agency that has 
        jurisdiction over the Federal public land--
                    (A) publishes appropriate notice of the withdrawal 
                or change, respectively;
                    (B) demonstrates that coordination has occurred 
                with a State fish and wildlife agency; and
                    (C) submits to the Committee on Natural Resources 
                of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
                Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate written 
                notice of the withdrawal or change, respectively.
            (2) Aggregate or cumulative effects.--If the aggregate or 
        cumulative effect of separate withdrawals or changes 
        effectively closes or significantly restricts 1,280 or more 
        acres of land or water, such withdrawals and changes shall be 
        treated as a single withdrawal or change for purposes of 
        paragraph (1).
            (3) Emergency closures.--Nothing in this title prohibits a 
        Federal land management agency from establishing or 
        implementing emergency closures or restrictions of the smallest 
        practicable area to provide for public safety, resource 
        conservation, national security, or other purposes authorized 
        by law. Such an emergency closure shall terminate after a 
        reasonable period of time unless converted to a permanent 
        closure consistent with this title.
    (h) National Park Service Units Not Affected.--Except as provided 
by subsection (l), nothing in this title shall affect or modify 
management or use of units of the National Park System.
    (i) No Priority.--Nothing in this title requires a Federal land 
management agency to give preference to recreational fishing, hunting, 
or shooting over other uses of Federal public land or over land or 
water management priorities established by Federal law.
    (j) Consultation With Councils.--In fulfilling the duties set forth 
in this title, the heads of Federal agencies shall consult with 
respective advisory councils as established in Executive Order Nos. 
12962 and 13443.
    (k) Authority of the States.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in this title shall be construed 
        as interfering with, diminishing, or conflicting with the 
        authority, jurisdiction, or responsibility of any State to 
        exercise primary management, control, or regulation of fish and 
        wildlife under State law (including regulations) on land or 
        water within the State, including on Federal public land.
            (2) Federal licenses.--Nothing in this title shall be 
        construed to authorize the head of a Federal agency to require 
        a license, fee, or permit to fish, hunt, or trap on land or 
        water in a State, including on Federal public land in the 
        States, except that this paragraph shall not affect the 
        Migratory Bird Stamp requirement set forth in the Migratory 
        Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act (16 U.S.C. 718 et 
        seq.).
    (l) Motorized Vessels in the Ozark National Scenic Riverways.--The 
Secretary of the Interior--
            (1) shall manage the Ozark National Scenic Riverways to 
        allow the use of motorized vessels in a manner that is not more 
        restrictive than the use restrictions in effect on November 21, 
        2013; and
            (2) may manage the Ozark National Scenic Riverways to allow 
        the use of motorized vessels in a manner that is less 
        restrictive than the use restrictions in effect on November 21, 
        2013.

SEC. 805. RESTRICTIONS ON HUNTING IN KISATCHIE NATIONAL FOREST.

    (a) Hunting in Kisatchie National Forest.--Consistent with the Act 
of June 4, 1897 (16 U.S.C. 551), the Secretary of Agriculture may not 
restrict the use of dogs in deer hunting activities in Kisatchie 
National Forest, unless such restrictions--
            (1) apply to the smallest practicable portions of such 
        unit; and
            (2) are necessary to reduce or control trespass onto land 
        adjacent to such unit.
    (b) Prior Restrictions Void.--Any restrictions regarding the use of 
dogs in deer hunting activities in Kisatchie National Forest in force 
on the date of the enactment of this Act shall be void and have no 
force or effect.
    (c) Adjacent Landowners.--Landowners whose property abuts a unit of 
the Kisatchie National Forest may petition the Secretary of Agriculture 
to restrict the use of dogs in deer hunting activities that take place 
on such unit which abut their property. If the Secretary of Agriculture 
receives a petition from an adjacent landowner, the Secretary, after 
notice and opportunity for a hearing, may impose restrictions on the 
use of dogs in deer hunting--
            (1) limited to those units of the Kisatchie National Forest 
        within 300 yards of the boundary of the petitioning landowner's 
        property; and

 TITLE XI--SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SNOWMOBILES ON NATIONAL FOREST 
                              SYSTEM LANDS

SEC. 1101. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The clear identification of roads, trails, and areas 
        for motor vehicle use in each National Forest will improve 
        management of National Forest System lands and protect these 
        national treasures, enhance opportunities, and address access 
        for motorized recreation experiences on National Forest System 
        lands and preserve areas of opportunity in each National Forest 
        for non-motorized travel and experiences.
            (2) The sport of snowmobiling supports thousands of jobs 
        across the country and provides a variety of enriching 
        recreational opportunities for both families and individuals.
            (3) In 2005, the Forest Service promulgated a Travel 
        Management Rule that required travel management plans for off-
        road vehicles, with the exception of snowmobiles, on all lands 
        managed by the Forest Service.
            (4) Under the 2005 Travel Management Rule, the Department 
        of Agriculture deemed that the use of snowmobiles on National 
        Forest System lands presented a different set of management 
        issues and environmental impacts on National Forest System 
        lands than the use of other types of motor vehicles. Therefore, 
        the final rule exempted snowmobiles from the mandatory 
        designation scheme provided for under section 212.51 of title 
        36, Code of Federal Regulations, but retained the National 
        Forest System's ability to allow, restrict or prohibit 
        snowmobile travel, as appropriate, on a case-by-case basis.
            (5) In 2013, the Ninth U.S. District Court of Idaho ruled 
        in the case captioned as Winter Wildlands Alliance v. US Forest 
        Service, Case No. 1:11-cv-00586-REB, ruled that the Forest 
        Service must promulgate travel management rules that include 
        snowmobiles. The Ninth U.S. District Court of Idaho required 
        that the final rule be promulgated by September 14, 2014, 
        barring no additional extension.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Forest 
Service should continue to allow snowmobiles access to National Forest 
System lands at the same levels as were allowed as of March 28, 2013, 
subject to closures for public health and safety at the discretion of 
the respective agencies, until a final travel management rule is 
promulgated for snowmobiles.

            Passed the House of Representatives February 5, 2014.
