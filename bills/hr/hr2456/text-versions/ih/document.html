        in accordance with subsection (e).

        opportunities for the disadvantaged.

SEC. 4. MAINTENANCE OF FUNDING LEVELS SPENT BY STATES ON EDUCATION.

    (a) In General.--For each State consolidating and using funds 
pursuant to a declaration of intent under this Act, for each school 
year of the declaration of intent, the aggregate amount of funds spent

than 90 percent of the aggregate amount of funds spent by the State on 
elementary and secondary education for the school year that coincides

    (b) Exception.--
            (1) State waiver claim.--The requirement of subsection (a) 
        may be waived by the State Authorizing Officials if the State 
        having a declaration of intent in effect makes a determination, 
        supported by specific findings, that uncontrollable or 
        exceptional circumstances, such as a natural disaster or 
        extreme contraction of economic activity, preclude compliance 
        for a specified period, which may be extended. Such

SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the amount 
that a State with a declaration of intent may expend for administrative 
expenses shall be limited to 1 percent of the aggregate amount of 
Federal funds made available to the State through the eligible programs 
included within the scope of such declaration of intent.
    (b) States Not Consolidating Funds Under Part A of Title I.--If the 
declaration of intent does not include within its scope part A of title 
I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311

shall be limited to 3 percent of the aggregate amount of Federal funds 
made available to the State pursuant to such declaration of intent.
