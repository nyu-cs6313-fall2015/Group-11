    The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (29 
U.S.C. 401 et seq.) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 611 (29 U.S.C. 531) as section 
        612; and
            (2) by inserting after section 610 (29 U.S.C. 530), the 
        following new section:

    ``Sec. 611.  (a) In General.--No labor organization shall terminate 
or in any other way discriminate against, or cause to be terminated or 
discriminated against, any covered employee of the labor organization

the employee or in the ordinary course of the duties of the employee 
(or any person acting pursuant to a request of the employee), has--
            ``(1) provided, caused to be provided, or is about to 
        provide or cause to be provided, information to the labor 
        organization, the Department of Labor, or any other State, 
        local, or Federal government authority or law enforcement 
        agency relating to any violation of, or any act or omission 
        that the employee reasonably believes to be a violation of, any 
        provision of this Act or any other provision of law that is 
        subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor, the 
        National Labor Relations Board, or any rule, order, standard, 
        or prohibition prescribed by the Department of Labor or the 
        National Labor Relations Board;
            ``(2) testified or will testify in any proceeding resulting 
        from the administration or enforcement of any provision of this 
        Act or any other provision of law that is subject to the 
        jurisdiction of the Department of Labor or National Labor 
        Relations Board, or any rule, order, standard, or prohibition 
        prescribed by the Department of Labor or the National Labor 
        Relations Board;

        (or other such person) reasonably believed to be in violation 
        of any law, rule, order, standard, or prohibition, subject to 
        the jurisdiction of, or enforceable by, the Department of Labor 
        or the National Labor Relations Board.
    ``(b) Definition of Covered Employee.--For the purposes of this 
section, the term `covered employee' means any employee of a labor 
organization who receives financial compensation for his or her

                discharge or discrimination and identifying the person 
                responsible for such act. Such a complaint must be 
                filed not later than either--

                        internal appeals, review, or other judicial or 
                        investigative process conducted by the labor 
                        organization employing such person.
                    ``(B) Actions of secretary of labor.--Upon receipt

                named in the complaint who is alleged to have committed 
                the violation that is the basis for the complaint an 
                opportunity to submit to the Secretary of Labor a 
                written response to the complaint and an opportunity to 
                meet with a representative of the Secretary of Labor to 
                present statements from witnesses, the Secretary of 
                Labor shall--
                            ``(i) initiate an investigation and 
                        determine whether there is reasonable cause to 
                        believe that the complaint has merit; and
                            ``(ii) notify the complainant and the 
                        person alleged to have committed the violation

                        determination.
                    ``(B) Notice of relief available.--If the Secretary 
                of Labor concludes that there is reasonable cause to 
                believe that a violation of subsection (a) has 
                occurred, the Secretary of Labor shall, together with 
                the notice under subparagraph (A)(ii), issue a 
                preliminary order providing the relief prescribed by 
                paragraph (4)(B).
                    ``(C) Request for hearing.--Not later than 30 days 
                after the date of receipt of notification of a 
                determination of the Secretary of Labor under this 
                paragraph, either the person alleged to have committed 
                the violation or the complainant may file objections to 
                the findings or preliminary order, or both, and request 
                a hearing on the record. The filing of such objections 
                shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy 
                contained in the preliminary order. Any such hearing 
                shall be conducted expeditiously, and if a hearing is 
                not requested in such 30-day period, the preliminary 
                order shall be deemed a final order that is not subject 
                to judicial review.
            ``(3) Grounds for determination of complaints.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary of Labor shall 
                dismiss a complaint filed under this subsection, and 
                shall not conduct an investigation otherwise required 
                under paragraph (2), unless the complainant makes a 
                prima facie showing that any behavior described in 
                paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (a) was a 
                contributing factor in the unfavorable personnel action 
                alleged in the complaint.
                    ``(B) Rebuttal evidence.--Notwithstanding a finding 
                by the Secretary of Labor that the complainant has made 
                the showing required under subparagraph (A), no 
                investigation otherwise required under paragraph (2) 
                shall be conducted, if the labor organization 
                demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that 
                the labor organization would have taken the same 
                unfavorable personnel action in the absence of that 
                behavior.
                    ``(C) Evidentiary standards.--The Secretary of 
                Labor may determine that a violation of subsection (a) 
                has occurred only if the complainant demonstrates that 
                any behavior described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of 
                subsection (a) was a contributing factor in the 
                unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint. 
                Relief may not be ordered under subparagraph (A) if the 
                labor organization demonstrates by clear and convincing 
                evidence that the labor organization would have taken 
                the same unfavorable personnel action in the absence of 
                that behavior.

                    ``(A) Timing.--Not later than 120 days after the 
                date of conclusion of any hearing under paragraph (2), 
                the Secretary of Labor shall issue a final order 
                providing the relief prescribed by this paragraph or 
                denying the complaint. At any time before issuance of a 
                final order, a proceeding under this subsection may be 
                terminated on the basis of a settlement agreement 
                entered into by the Secretary of Labor, the 
                complainant, and the person alleged to have committed 
                the violation.

                        violation of subsection (a) has occurred, the 
                        Secretary of Labor shall order the person who
