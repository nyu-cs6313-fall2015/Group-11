 To prohibit the Department of Defense from retaining any interest in 
  real property disposed of pursuant to a base closure law when that 
 property was originally acquired by the United States by donation for 
   the purpose of establishing or expanding a military installation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. CONDITION ON DISPOSAL OF BASE CLOSURE REAL PROPERTY 
              ORIGINALLY ACQUIRED BY THE UNITED STATES BY DONATION.

    (a) Conveyance of Full Interest in Donated Real Property.--Whenever 
a military installation is closed pursuant to a base closure law and 
the military installation contains real property that was originally 
acquired by the United States by donation for the purpose of 
establishing or expanding the installation, the conveyance of the real 
property originally acquired by donation shall include, except as 
provided in subsection (b), all right, title, and interest of the 
United States in and to the property at the time of the conveyance.
    (b) Retention of Reversionary Interests.--If real property 
described in subsection (a) is conveyed by the United States without 
consideration or for consideration equal to less than the fair market 
value of the property to support the subsequent use of the conveyed 
property for a public purpose or use, the Secretary of Defense may 
authorize the retention of a reversionary interest to ensure that the 
conveyed property is used for that public purpose.
    (c) Retroactive Application.--In the case of real property 
described in subsection (a) that was conveyed before the date of the 
enactment of this Act pursuant to a base closure law, the Secretary of 
Defense shall convey to the recipient of the property, not later than 
one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, all right, title, 
and interest in and to the property (other than an interest described 
in subsection (b)) that was retained by the United States upon the 
original conveyance of the property to the recipient.
    (d) Base Closure Law Defined.--In this section, the term ``base 
closure law'' means--
            (1) the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 
        (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 
        note);
            (2) title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and 
        Base Closure and Realignment Act (Public Law 100-526; 10 U.S.C. 
        2687 note);
            (3) section 2687 of title 10, United States Code, if the 
        authority of such section is used after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act; and
            (4) any other law enacted after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act that provides for the closure of military 
        installations.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
