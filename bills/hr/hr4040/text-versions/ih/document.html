 TITLE I--IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED 
       SERVICES AND FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING

                     Subtitle A--General Provisions

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The history of the education of deaf and hard of 
        hearing students in the United States began with the education 
        of Alice Cogswell in Connecticut in the early 1800s. Born in 
        1805, Alice became deaf at a young age. By the time she was 
        nine, she was befriended by a neighbor, Thomas Gallaudet, who 
        demonstrated that she could make the association between 
        objects and the written words for them. Soon she became the 
        focus of an initiative to found a school for deaf individuals 
        in America. In April of 1817, Gallaudet and a deaf teacher, 
        Laurent Clerc, opened the first successful American school for 
        deaf persons--the American School for the Deaf--with Alice as 
        its first pupil. From an initial class of seven students, the 
        school grew into a national institution, the mother school of 
        many subsequent schools for the deaf and the training ground 
        for their principals and teachers. Alice Cogswell's story 
        reminds us that deaf and hard of hearing children are capable 
        of learning and achieving to high levels when they have access 
        to full language and communication, are taught by professionals 
        with specialized training in the unique needs of deaf and hard 
        of hearing students, and have access to educational placements 
        that recognize and provide for their language, communication, 
        and academic needs.
            (2) Deaf and hard of hearing children need early and 
        ongoing access to language. Research demonstrates that deaf and 
        hard of hearing children who are identified early and receive 
        appropriate early intervention from specialized, qualified 
        providers achieve higher language and communication outcomes 
        than those who are identified late and do not receive such 
        services. However, currently, early intervention services 
        typically are not provided in a timely manner, severe shortages 
        of specialized early intervention professionals exist, and many 
        deaf and hard of hearing children are not reaching their 
        developmental potential.
            (3) Deaf and hard of hearing children are born with the 
        same capacity to learn and achieve as any other child. However, 
        historically as a group, their literacy and academic outcomes 
        have not been commensurate with their abilities. The education 
        system in the United States must better meet the academic and 
        related learning needs of these students, who can succeed when 
        those needs are addressed.
            (4) A principal way that hearing students acquire knowledge 
        and skills is through incidental learning, the process of 
        observing others and the environment that occurs naturally at 
        home, at school and in the community. Deficits in incidental 
        learning leave deaf and hard of hearing students behind in the 
        acquisition of an array of academic and social-emotional skill 
        areas. In addition to core academics such as reading, 
        mathematics and science, deaf and hard of hearing students must 
        also receive specialized instruction and services designed to 
        maximize their capacity to learn effectively and live 
        productively and independently. These include instruction in 
        audiology, age appropriate career education, communication and 
        language, including American Sign Language and spoken language 
        with or without visual supports, functional skills for academic 
        success, self-determination and advocacy (including preparation 
        for transition to work or higher education), social emotional 
        skills, technology, and support for the student through family 
        education.
            (5) It is imperative that deaf and hard of hearing students 
        have communication and language access and development. The 
        development of age appropriate communication and language 
        skills is essential to any cognitive, psychological and 
        educational growth. Without communication and language a 
        student cannot become literate or educated. Without 
        communication and language a student will not develop reading, 
        computation, writing, analytical, and other necessary skills. 
        The importance of an education in which communication and 
        language access and development are provided is not merely a 
        matter of educational methodology or classroom strategy but a 
        right equal to the right of any student to access classroom 
        information, communicate with peers and staff, and develop 
        literacies required for educational success. When students are 
        deprived of communication and language access and development 
        they cannot meaningfully engage in the rich and varied 
        experience that is American education and become active members 
        in our American democracy. Communication and language are the 
        first building blocks in any education and are required for 
        human development.
            (6) Since the 1997 reauthorization of the Individuals with 
        Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), IEP Teams have been required 
        to consider the language and communication needs of students 
        who are deaf and hard of hearing, including opportunities for 
        direct communications with peers and professional personnel in 
        the child's language and communication mode, academic level, 
        and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct 
        instruction in the child's language and communication mode. 
        Further, it is been the U.S. Department of Education's position 
        since 1992 that ``[a]ny educational setting that does not meet 
        the communication and related needs of a child who is deaf does 
        not allow for the provision of [a Free Appropriate Public 
        Education] and cannot be considered the [Least Restrictive 
        Environment] for that child. Just as the [Individuals with 
        Disabilities Education Act] requires placement in the regular 
        educational setting when it is appropriate for the unique needs 
        of a child who is deaf, it also requires placement outside of 
        the regular educational setting when the child's needs cannot 
        be met in that setting'' (Deaf Students Education Services: 
        Policy Guidance,'' 57 Fed. Reg. 49274 (1992)). And it is well 
        argued that deaf and hard of hearing students benefit from a 
        setting in which a critical mass of deaf and hard of hearing 
        peers is found. Nevertheless, it has been contended that few 
        deaf and hard of hearing students are receiving full access to 
        language and communication in the regular education setting, 
        and few have access to a critical mass of peers. This lack of 
        language and communication access contributes to students' 
        social isolation and to the inability of graduates to achieve 
        academic outcomes on par with those of their hearing peers. 
        Since the U.S. Department of Education does not require 
        sufficient monitoring of State and local educational agencies 
        to fully and accurately account for their legal obligations to 
        address the language and communication needs of deaf and hard 
        of hearing students, it is not possible to confirm systemically 
        whether such agencies are in compliance with current law. Given 
        that nationally students who are deaf or hard of hearing 
        require more language and communication access and more support 
        to acquire services and skills than they are currently 
        receiving, and given that provision of currently required 
        instruction and placement for such students cannot be 
        adequately assured, IDEA must be strengthened and supplemented 
        to ensure that deaf and hard of hearing students truly receive 
        a free and appropriate public education.
            (7) A prerequisite to better meeting these needs is every 
        State and local educational agency's identification and proper 
        evaluation of each student who is deaf or hard of hearing, 
        regardless of whether such student may have other, even 
        potentially more significant, disabilities. While IDEA does not 
        mandate that State and local educational agencies classify 
        students into specific disability categories, the widespread 
        use of IDEA's disability categories has led to a sizable 
        undercount of deaf and hard of hearing students and, 
        consequently, a lack of recognition of the extent of the 
        systemic need for the delivery of appropriate instructional 
        services provided by personnel initially trained and 
        continually supported to meet such students' unique educational 
        needs. Indeed, while the U.S. Census Bureau supports the 
        contention that more than 350,000 students nationally have 
        ``hearing difficulties,'' the Department of Education routinely 
        reports serving under IDEA a population of approximately 
        73,000. This occurs in large measure because students who are 
        deaf or hard of hearing who also have additional disabilities 
        are frequently formally classified by State and local 
        educational agencies as having multiple disabilities. 
        Consequently, such students' hearing disabilities are not fully 
        acknowledged either in terms of educational agency recognized 
        need for personnel trained to serve such students, or in terms 
        of an individual student's need for the services of such 
        personnel.
            (8) It is critical that State and local educational 
        agencies be better prepared to meet these largely unmet needs. 
        To reach this goal, teachers of the deaf and their colleagues 
        in related services must be better supported to provide the 
        full array of specialized instruction and services required by 
        deaf and hard of hearing students. Proper assessment of the 
        unique needs of students who are deaf or hard of hearing, along 
        with proper deployment of specialized instruction and 
        interventions, must keep pace with the most current educational 
        theories and practices and be based on the best available 
        evidence. Significantly greater accountability for results for 
        students who are deaf or hard of hearing, including those with 
        additional disabilities, must be built into America's special 
        education system if deaf and hard of hearing students are to 
        succeed. And it is imperative that all deaf and hard of hearing 
        students, regardless of disability category, are identified and 
        their learning needs fully accounted for.
            (9) Deaf and hard of hearing children across the United 
        States should experience the same kind of access to language 
        development, social interaction, and academic opportunities 
        experienced by their peers. Deaf and hard of hearing children 
        are as diverse as any other group of children, and the choices 
        in communication, educational placement options, and other 
        decisions are complex and need to be individualized.
            (10) Existing high quality resources must be preserved and 
        leveraged so that students who are deaf or hard of hearing do 
        not fall farther behind. Specialized schools for children who 
        are deaf and hard of hearing perform a unique service and must 
        be valued and maintained as part of the continuum of 
        alternative placements. Both special schools and center-based 
        programs serving children who are deaf or hard of hearing 
        should be tapped for the expert personnel and services such 
        resources can offer, and IDEA's worthy policy objective to 
        ensure the full integration of children with disabilities ought 
        not be allowed to frustrate the delivery of all appropriate 
        services to children with unique needs, whether those services 
        be provided at a specialized school, a local school, or some 
        combination of the two.

SEC. 102. IDENTIFYING STUDENTS WHO ARE DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING.

    (a) Serving All Children Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Regardless 
of Classification.--Section 612(a)(3) (20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(3)) is amended 
at the end by adding the following:
                    ``(C) Serving children who are deaf or hard of 
                hearing.--When a State classifies children by 
                disability, the State, in complying with subsection 
                (a), identifies, locates and evaluates children who are 
                deaf or hard of hearing who are, or may be, classified 
                in a disability category other than hearing impairment 
                and provides (without prejudice to such classification) 
                special education and related services to such 
                children, including such services determined 
                appropriate based on proper evaluation as would be 
                provided to children classified in the State as deaf or 
                hard of hearing.''.
    (b) Data Collection and Reporting.--Section 618 (20 U.S.C. 1418) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e) Accounting for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students.--In 
addition to the data collection and reporting requirements of 
subsections (a) through (d) and subject to such provisions, the State 
and the Secretary of the Interior shall, with respect to children 
classified in a disability category other than hearing impairment or 
deafness, include the number and percentage of such children in each 
disability category who are also deaf or hard of hearing.''.
    (c) Child With a Disability.--Section 602(3)(A)(i) (20 U.S.C. 
1401(3)(A)(i)) is amended to read as follows:
                            ``(i) with intellectual disabilities, who 
                        is deaf or hard of hearing, with speech or 
                        language impairments, visual impairments 
                        (including blindness), serious emotional 
                        disturbance (referred to in this part as 
                        `emotional disturbance'), orthopedic 
                        impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, 
                        other health impairments, or specific learning 
                        disabilities; and''.

SEC. 103. STATE PLANS.

    Section 612 (20 U.S.C. 1412) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:

TITLE II--IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED 
             SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WITH VISUAL DISABILITIES

                     Subtitle A--General Provisions

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) When renowned American author, Mark Twain, immortalized 
        Helen Keller's beloved teacher, Anne Sullivan Macy, with the 
        moniker ``the miracle worker'', his words, though meant as 
        well-deserved praise, reflect the misconception persisting even 
        today that educating individuals with disabilities is a nearly 
        insurmountable task requiring extraordinary feats performed by 
        exceptionally gifted and saintly persons. To be sure, the work 
        of teaching children with disabilities can and does occur when 
        committed and qualified but everyday special educators are 
        properly prepared and supported to practice their professions. 
        However, the educational systems within which they act must 
        also be held accountable for results.
            (2) Research demonstrates that students with visual 
        disabilities are among the highest performing students with 
        disabilities in terms of academic achievement, and yet they are 
        among the least employed, even after successful accomplishment 
        of post-secondary academic objectives. Many factors contribute 
        to this unacceptable inequity, including employer 
        discrimination, low expectations of people with disabilities 
        generally, and a lack of student preparation for the work world 
        and full participation in society.
            (3) It is clear that America's special education system 
        needs to be improved if the most successful academic achievers 
        are to leave school prepared to be independent and productive 
        citizens who can participate fully in the American dream. Such 
        improvements must better account for the distinct academic and 
        related learning needs of students with visual disabilities who 
        can only succeed both when visual-disabilities-specific skills 
        are taught and when generally-needed skills are taught in a 
        manner that addresses, rather than ignores, the unique ways in 
        which students with visual disabilities learn.
            (4) A principal way that students without visual 
        disabilities acquire knowledge and skills is through incidental 
        learning, the process of observing others and the environment 
        that occurs naturally at home, at school and in community, and 
        deficits in incidental learning leave students with visual 
        disabilities behind in the acquisition of an array of skill 
        areas. In addition to core academics such as reading, 
        mathematics and science, students with visual disabilities must 
        also receive instruction in the so-called expanded core 
        curriculum, a comprehensive array of specialized instruction 
        and services maximizing the capacity of students with visual 
        disabilities to learn effectively and live both productively 
        and independently. The expanded core curriculum includes 
        instruction in communication and productivity (including 
        Braille instruction, and assistive technology proficiency 
        inclusive of low vision devices); self-sufficiency and 
        interaction (including orientation and mobility, self 
        determination, sensory efficiency, socialization, recreation 
        and fitness, and independent living skills); and age 
        appropriate career education.
            (5) Special education teachers, such as teachers of 
        students with visual impairments (TVIs), partner with related 
        services personnel, such as orientation and mobility 
        instructors, and general educators to provide students with 
        disabilities individualized quality academic and related 
        instruction to position students, to the maximum extent 
        possible, for successful transition to post-school independent 
        living, societal integration, and employment. To do their jobs 
        well, TVIs and their colleagues in related services must be 
        both initially properly trained and continually supported 
        through readily available resources and continuing education to 
        assist them in dealing with the constant evolution in 
        instructional methods, the vast diversity of the population 
        with which they work, enormous case loads, and the scarcity of 
        time to devote necessary individualized attention to each 
        student with visual disabilities. Both the need for an expanded 
        variety of continuing education opportunities for TVIs and the 
        need for preparation programs producing personnel who can serve 
        the full diversity of needs within the population of students 
        with visual disabilities have been well documented.
            (6) Since the 1997 reauthorization of the Individuals with 
        Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), students who are blind have 
        been entitled to instruction in Braille and use of Braille 
        unless the individualized education program (IEP) team makes an 
        affirmative determination that such instruction is not 
        appropriate for a given student. Nevertheless, it has been 
        forcefully argued that few students today who should be 
        receiving instruction in Braille are indeed receiving it and 
        that this lack of Braille instruction contributes mightily to 
        the inability of graduates with visual disabilities to 
        participate fully in the workforce. Since the U.S. Department 
        of Education does not require State and local educational 
        agencies to fully and accurately account for their legal 
        obligations to provide Braille instruction to each student for 
        whom such instruction is appropriate, it is not possible to 
        confirm systemically whether such agencies are in compliance 
        with current law. Given that students with visual disabilities 
        require more support than they are currently receiving 
        nationally to acquire services and skills comprising the 
        expanded core curriculum, and given that provision of currently 
        required instruction for such students, such as Braille, cannot 
        be adequately assured, IDEA must be strengthened and 
        supplemented to ensure that students with visual disabilities 
        truly receive a free and appropriate public education.
            (7) A prerequisite to better meeting these demonstrable 
        needs is every State and local educational agency's 
        identification and proper evaluation of each student who 
        experiences visual disability, regardless of whether such 
        student may have other, even potentially more significant, 
        disabilities. While IDEA does not mandate that State and local 
        educational agencies classify students into specific disability 
        categories, the widespread use of IDEA's disability categories 
        has led to a sizable undercount of students with visual 
        disabilities and, consequently, a lack of recognition of the 
        extent of the systemic need for the delivery of appropriate 
        instructional services provided by personnel initially trained 
        and continually supported to meet such students' unique 
        educational needs. Indeed, while research supports the 
        contention that more than 100,000 students nationally who have 
        visual disabilities require special education and related 
        services, the Department of Education routinely reports the 
        size of this population at one third such census. This occurs 
        in large measure because students who are blind or visually 
        impaired who also have additional disabilities are frequently 
        formally classified by State and local educational agencies as 
        having multiple disabilities. Consequently, such students' 
        visual disabilities are not fully acknowledged either in terms 
        of educational agency recognized need for personnel trained to 
        serve such students, or in terms of an individual student's 
        need for the services of such personnel.
            (8) It is critical that State and local educational 
        agencies be better prepared to meet these largely unmet needs. 
        To reach this goal, TVIs and their colleagues in related 
        services must be better supported to provide the full array of 
        specialized instruction and services required by students with 
        visual disabilities. Proper assessment of the unique needs of 
        students with visual disabilities, along with proper deployment 
        of specialized instruction and interventions, must keep pace 
        with the most current educational theories and practices and be 
        based on the best available evidence. Significantly greater 
        accountability for results for students with visual 
        disabilities, including those with additional disabilities, 
        must be built into America's special education system if 
        students with visual disabilities are to succeed as they can 
        and must. And it is imperative that all students with visual 
        disabilities, regardless of disability category, are identified 
        and their learning needs fully accounted for.
            (9) While examples of contexts do exist around the country, 
        from specialized schools to neighborhood schools, demonstrating 
        successful provision of a full range of services and 
        instruction meeting the unique needs of students with visual 
        disabilities, the services and instruction afforded by such 
        exemplary programs are far from nationally consistent and must 
        be recognized and modeled. To replicate and build on these 
        successes, a national resource is needed to supplement the work 
        of State and local educational agencies through student 
        enrichment activities, to support TVIs and related services 
        personnel through state-of-the-art continuing education 
        opportunities, and to spur the further advancement of 
        instructional services for students with visual disabilities 
        through scientific research and evidence-based best practices.
            (10) While these clarifications and enhancements must be 
        made, it is vital that existing high quality resources be 
        preserved and leveraged so that students with visual 
        disabilities do not fall farther behind. Specialized schools 
        for children who are blind must be expected to perform but must 
        not fall victim to mere State budget expediency. Both special 
        schools and center-based programs serving children with visual 
        disabilities should be tapped for the expert personnel and 
        services such resources can offer, and IDEA's worthy policy 
        objective to ensure the full integration of children with 
        disabilities ought not be allowed to frustrate the delivery of 
        all appropriate services to children with unique needs.
