        provide confirmation or a tentative nonconfirmation of an 
        individual's identity and employment eligibility within 3 
        working days of the initial inquiry. If providing confirmation 
        or tentative nonconfirmation, the verification system shall 
        provide an appropriate code indicating such confirmation or 
        such nonconfirmation.
            ``(3) Secondary confirmation process in case of tentative 
        nonconfirmation.--In cases of tentative nonconfirmation, the 
        Secretary shall specify, in consultation with the Commissioner 
        of Social Security, an available secondary verification process 
        to confirm the validity of information provided and to provide 
        a final confirmation or nonconfirmation not later than 10 
        working days after the date on which the notice of the 
        tentative nonconfirmation is received by the employee. The 
        Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner, may extend 
        this deadline on a case-by-case basis, and if the time is 
        extended, shall document such extension within the verification 
        system. When final confirmation or nonconfirmation is provided, 
        the verification system shall provide an appropriate code

              SYSTEMS.

    In consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and 
the Commissioner of Social Security, the Secretary of Homeland Security 
shall take the following actions:
            (1) Work with the States to establish a common data set and 
        common data exchange protocol for electronic birth registration 
        systems and death registration systems.
            (2) Coordinate requirements for such systems to align with 
        a national model.
            (3) Ensure that fraud prevention is built into the design 
        of electronic vital registration systems in the collection of 
        vital event data, the issuance of birth certificates, and the 
        exchange of data among government agencies.
            (4) Ensure that electronic systems for issuing birth 
        certificates, in the form of printed abstracts of birth records 
        or digitized images, employ a common format of the certified 
        copy, so that those requiring such documents can quickly 
        confirm their validity.
            (5) Establish uniform field requirements for State birth 
        registries.
            (6) Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, establish a process with the Department of Defense 
        that will result in the sharing of data, with the States and 
        the Social Security Administration, regarding deaths of United 
        States military personnel and the birth and death of their 
        dependents.
            (7) Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, establish a process with the Department of State 
        to improve registration, notification, and the sharing of data 
        with the States and the Social Security Administration, 
        regarding births and deaths of United States citizens abroad.
            (8) Not later than 3 years after the date of establishment 
        of databases provided for under this section, require States to 
        record and retain electronic records of pertinent 
        identification information collected from requestors who are 
        not the registrants.
            (9) Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, submit to Congress a report on whether there is a 
        need for Federal laws to address penalties for fraud and misuse 
        of vital records and whether violations are sufficiently 
        enforced.

SEC. 202. ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR DOCUMENT FRAUD.
