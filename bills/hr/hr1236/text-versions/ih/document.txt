 To amend title 10, United States Code, to require the inclusion of a 
 behavioral health professional on any physical evaluation board that

              EVALUATION BOARDS.

    Section 1222 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following new subsection:

physical evaluation board will consider issues related to post-
traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, or other mental 
health condition, the physical evaluation board must include a 
behavioral health professional as a member of the board. The behavioral 
health professional shall serve in lieu of the medical member of the 
physical evaluation board unless, as a result of the health-related 
issues before the board, the board would benefit from the presence of 
both a behavioral health professional and medical member.
    ``(2) In this subsection, the term `behavioral health professional' 
means a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, licensed clinical social 
worker, or psychiatric advanced practice registered nurse.''.
