SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UNITED STATES BONDS TO FUND 
              ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH.

    (a) Issuance of Bonds.--Section 3102 of title 31, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(f) Issuance of United States Alzheimer's Bonds.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may issue bonds under this 
        section to aid in the funding of Alzheimer's research. The 
        Secretary shall carry out this paragraph in consultation with 
        the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of 
        the National Institutes of Health.
            ``(2) Form.--The bonds authorized by paragraph (1) shall be 
        in such form and denominations, and shall be subject to such 
        terms and conditions of issue, conversion, redemption, 
        maturation, payment, and rate of interest as the Secretary may 
        prescribe.
            ``(3) Annual report.--The Secretary, in consultation with 
        the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of 
        the National Institutes of Health, shall submit an annual 
        report to the Congress describing the actions taken by the 
        Secretaries under this subsection during the year covered by 
        the report. The first such report shall describe the 
        implementation of the program under this subsection, and each

        the program.''.

Secretary of the Treasury from the sale of bonds under section 3102(f) 
of title 31, United States Code, less amounts determined by the 
Secretary to be necessary for administration of such sales, are 
authorized to be appropriated to the Director of the National 
Institutes of Health for research under title IV of the Public Health 
Service Act and shall be used solely for Alzheimer's research.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that any funds 
collected pursuant to section 3102(f) of title 31, United States Code 
(as added by this Act) are in addition to yearly appropriated funds and 
not to be used to supplement current funding.
