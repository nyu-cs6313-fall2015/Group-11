			</paragraph><paragraph id="H6E47570E55864DA387FF66B0A36E7498"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Medicaid enrollees include families, pregnant women, children, individuals with disabilities, and
			 other low-income individuals. Without Medicaid coverage, many enrollees
			 would be uninsured or lack coverage for services they need.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H4671D74AFA434C448FB757CF7210D193"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In 2013, the Medicaid program covered 62,000,000 individuals, or 1 in every 5 Americans. This
			 number will continue to grow, particularly since the Affordable Care Act
			 significantly expanded eligibility to millions of uninsured adults.
			 Enrollment in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program is
			 projected to increase by 12,800,000 by 2016.</text>

			 coverage under Medicaid.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H7988212DD4A741E58BD87D3C2229926D"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In 47 States and in the District of Columbia, Medicaid pays up to 67 percent less than Medicare for
			 the same primary care services.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0454418E23D24F15AEA2C24922FE2985"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Multiple studies have concluded that higher Medicaid payment rates would increase the probability
			 of primary care providers accepting new Medicaid patients, and would
			 further support current Medicaid providers.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0F8AD9DBEA354568A950FFA09F466E8C"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Congress has recognized that low provider participation in Medicaid decreases access to health
			 care. To address this problem, Congress acted to increase Medicaid
			 payments for certain primary care services to be not less than the
			 Medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HDE2F7BDB3F9545F8900AC7452AF55F93"><enum>(8)</enum><text>As more Americans become insured and empowered participants in their own health care, demand for

			 physician on a regular basis. They are more likely to see their OB/GYN
			 physician on a regular basis than any other type of provider. Given that
			 women comprise the majority of Medicaid enrollees, it is critical that
			 primary care providers, including OB/GYN physicians, receive sufficient
			 reimbursement to participate in Medicaid.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HFA533D1857EA4EB397901CB02EB7A2B9"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Nurse practitioners and other mid-level health professionals deliver many primary care services.
			 Applying Medicare’s rates for nurse practitioners and mid-level health
			 professionals encourages greater participation in Medicaid, thereby
			 increasing access to primary care, particularly in underserved areas.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H34585236BFD24396836B701FC0B953EB"><enum>(11)</enum><text>The enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rate ensures providers have the financial capability to serve
			 their patients’ primary care needs. Furthermore, adding nurse
			 practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse-midwives, and OB/GYN
			 physicians serving in primary care settings increases access to critical
			 health care services for women and children nationwide.</text>
