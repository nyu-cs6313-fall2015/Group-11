			<paragraph id="HFFB733A4B1BA4E16AB762DBC73662C33"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The Federal Bureau
			 of Investigation (FBI) has testified that <quote>today’s financial crisis
			 dwarves the S&amp;L crisis as financial institutions have reduced their assets
			 by more than $1 trillion related to the current global financial crisis
			 compared to the estimated $160 million lost during the S&amp;L crisis.</quote>
			 (Testimony by Mr. John Pistole, Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of
			 Investigation of the United States Department of Justice before the U.S. Senate
			 Committee on the Judiciary, February 11, 2009).</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H46F66EE4A98640C1AB959B0708E5BAC2"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The FBI has
			 testified that mortgage fraud was such a major contributor to the current
			 global financial crisis that: <quote>it would be irresponsible to neglect
			 mortgage fraud’s impact on the U.S. housing and financial
			 markets</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H895A5F82C36E4D0BB743D4F0A5212902"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In the late 1980s
			 and early 1990s, the United States experienced a similar financial crisis with
			 the collapse of the Savings and Loan institutions. Again, according to Deputy
			 Director Pistole, <quote>the Department of Justice (DOJ), [and more
			 specifically the FBI], were provided a number of tools through the Financial
			 Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and Crime
			 Control Act of 1990 (CCA) to combat the aforementioned crisis. As stated in
			 Senate Bill 331 dated January 27, 2009, <quote>in the wake of the Savings and
			 Loan crisis of the 1980s, a series of strike forces based in 27 cities was
			 staffed with 1,000 FBI agents and forensic experts and dozens of Federal
			 prosecutors</quote>.</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H51CAA794904D49F7B6BB43DAE543EEDE"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Fraud also played a decisive role in the
			 Savings and Loan crisis. The FBI and Justice Department made prosecuting those
			 elite frauds among its highest priorities. This took a massive commitment of
			 FBI resources, but it produced the most successful prosecution of an epidemic
			 of elite fraud in history—over 1,000 <quote>priority</quote> felony convictions
			 of senior insiders, according to Professor William K. Black in his book
			 <quote>The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HD5ECF57D05C34280A39E1A0473101C7D"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">However, the FBI, because of its crippling
			 personnel limitations, has been unable to assign sufficient FBI agents assigned
			 to investigate the current global financial crisis. The FBI identified the
			 mortgage fraud <quote>epidemic</quote> in congressional testimony in September
			 2004. It had so few white-collar crime specialists available, however, that it
			 was able to assign only 120 special agents to mortgage fraud cases—less than
			 one-eighth the agents it found essential to respond adequately to the huge, but
			 far smaller, Savings and Loan crisis.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0CDD810B17F44D5BBAA86BD6CE9DF57C"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Given the
			 magnitude of the financial crisis of 2008 and the resulting losses and billions
			 of taxpayer dollars spent to keep the financial system from collapsing, the FBI
			 should have no less than 1,000 agents to address corporate, securities, and
			 mortgage fraud located across the country, and, in addition, more forensic
			 experts and Federal prosecutors to uncover the crimes committed and bring the
			 perpetrators to justice.</text>
