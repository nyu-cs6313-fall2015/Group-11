                                 A BILL


 
 To amend section 276 of the Immigration and Nationality Act to impose 
  mandatory sentencing ranges with respect to aliens who reenter the 
    United States after having been removed, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Criminal Alien Accountability Act''.

SEC. 2. MANDATORY SENTENCING RANGES RELATED TO REENTRY BY REMOVED 
              ALIEN.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The security of the United States is dependent on the 
        Nation's ability to regulate the immigration of aliens into the 
        United States.
            (2) Removal from the United States of certain criminal 
        aliens is necessary, and the unauthorized reentry of those 
        aliens constitutes a threat to the people of the United States.
            (3) The Congress should deter such reentry by specifying 
        mandatory sentencing ranges for these crimes.
    (b) Mandatory Sentencing Ranges for Reentering Aliens.--Section 276 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1326) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), in the matter following paragraph 
        (2), by striking ``imprisoned not more than 2 years,'' and 
        insert ``imprisoned for a term of not less than 1 year and not 
        more than 2 years,''; and
            (2) in subsection (b)--
                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``imprisoned not 
                more than 10 years,'' and insert ``imprisoned for a 
                term of not less than 5 years and not more than 10 
                years,'';
                    (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``imprisoned not 
                more than 20 years,'' and insert ``imprisoned for a 
                term of not less than 10 years and not more than 20 
                years,''; and
                    (C) in paragraph (4), by striking ``imprisoned for 
                not more than 10 years,'' and insert ``imprisoned for a 
                term of not less than 5 years and not more than 10 
                years,''.
    (c) Mandatory Sentencing Ranges for Persons Aiding or Assisting 
Certain Reentering Aliens.--Section 277 of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1327) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``Any person'' and inserting ``(a) Subject 
        to subsection (b), any person''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(b)(1) Any person who knowingly aids or assists any alien 
violating section 276(b) to reenter the United States, or who connives 
or conspires with any person or persons to allow, procure, or permit 
any such alien to reenter the United States, shall be fined under title 
18, United States Code, or imprisoned for a term imposed under 
paragraph (2), or both.
    ``(2) The term of imprisonment imposed under paragraph (1) shall be 
within the range to which the reentering alien is subject under section 
276(b).''.
                                 <all>
