    (b) Effect of Violations.--A member of the Armed Forces who

        subsection (a)(2)(A) in response to the first substantiated 
        violation by the member of the policy established pursuant to 
        subsection (a), when the member is not otherwise punitively 
        discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces for that 
        violation.
            (B) The Secretary of each military department shall revise

        additionally prescribed, as considered necessary by the 
        Secretaries, pursuant to subsection (f).
            (B) The requirement imposed by paragraph (1) shall not be

        Armed Forces for administrative separation--

        (1), a violation by a member of the Armed Forces described in 
        subsection (a)(2)(A) of the policy established pursuant to 
        subsection (a) shall be treated as substantiated if--
                    (A) there has been a court-martial conviction for 
                violation of the policy, but the adjudged sentence does
