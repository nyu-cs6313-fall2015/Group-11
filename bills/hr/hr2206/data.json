Makes violators subject to prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).\n\nDirects such Secretaries to require the processing for administrative separation of any member in response to the first substantiated violation of such policy, if the member is not otherwise punitively discharged or dismissed for such violation.\n\nRequires the DOD Secretary to submit to the congressional defense committees a proposed UCMJ punitive article regarding such violations."
