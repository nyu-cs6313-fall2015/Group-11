SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Constitution of the United States invests in 
        Congress the authority to manage Federal lands and the natural 
        resources contained within them;
            (2) the natural resources contained within lands owned by 
        the Federal Government are ultimately owned by the people, and 
        can be explored and developed by them in their pursuit of 
        happiness to fuel the American way of life;
            (3) the United States spends over $1,000,000,000 per day to 
        import crude oil from foreign countries, representing the 
        largest wealth transfer in history;
            (4) the domestic oil and natural gas industry is 
        responsible for approximately 9.2 million jobs;
            (5) the United States has substantial undeveloped oil and 
        natural gas resources underlying Federal lands;
            (6) multiple legal challenges relating to the leasing, 
        exploration, and development of Federal lands can significantly 
        delay and even prevent these desperately needed oil and natural 
        gas resources from reaching the American public;
            (7) expedited and focused judicial review of legal 
        challenges to proposed oil and natural gas development 
        activities is necessary to ensure that additional American oil 
        and natural gas resources are made available without undue 
        delay to American consumers;
            (8) the approximately 43 million leased outer Continental 
        Shelf acres currently account for about 15 percent of the 
        United States domestic natural gas production and about 27 
        percent of the United States domestic oil production;
            (9) the leasing of these domestic offshore areas for oil 
        and natural gas development provides significant economic 
        benefits to the Federal Government, as well as to States and 
        localities, through the creation and sustenance of jobs and 
        domestic product;
            (10) the Federal Government distributed over 
        $10,000,000,000 to Federal, State and Indian accounts from 
        energy production during fiscal year 2009, primarily from oil 
        and natural gas production;
            (11) the outer Continental Shelf is a vital national 
        resource reserve held by the Federal Government for the public, 
        which should be made available for expeditious and orderly 
        development, subject to environmental safeguards, in a manner 
        that is consistent with the maintenance of competition and 
        other national needs;
            (12) Executive Order 13563 on Improving Regulation and 
        Regulatory Review, issued on January 18, 2011, requires that to 
        the extent permitted by law, each agency must, among other 
        things--
                    (A) propose or adopt a regulation only upon a 
                reasoned determination that its benefits justify its 
                costs (recognizing that some benefits and costs are 
                difficult to quantify);
                    (B) tailor its regulations to impose the least 
                burden on society, consistent with obtaining regulatory 
                objectives, taking into account, among other things, 
                and to the extent practicable, the costs of cumulative 
                regulations;
                    (C) select, in choosing among alternative 
                regulatory approaches, those approaches that maximize 
                net benefits (including potential economic, 
                environmental, public health and safety, and other 
                advantages; distributive impacts; and equity);
                    (D) to the extent feasible, specify performance 
                objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or 
                manner of compliance that regulated entities must 
                adopt; and
                    (E) identify and assess available alternatives to 
                direct regulation, including providing economic 
                incentives to encourage the desired behavior, such as 
                user fees or marketable permits, or providing 
                information upon which choices can be made by the 
                public;
            (13) Executive Order 13547 on Stewardship of the Ocean, Our 
        Coasts, and the Great Lakes, issued on July 19, 2010, provides 
        for the development of coastal and marine spatial plans (CMSP) 
        that build upon and improve existing Federal, State, tribal, 
        local, and regional decisionmaking and planning processes;
            (14) the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 
        et seq.) already provides a comprehensive and complete 
        framework for undertaking oil and gas activities within the 
        framework of a CMSP-based program;
            (15) through the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, 
        Congress has already established the process for development of 
        coastal and marine spatial plans for oil and gas leasing and 
        other authorizations, and it is not necessary to create a new 
        regulatory regime as this would go against the Executive order;
            (16) the Coastal Plain of Alaska is an important potential 
        new source of domestic oil and gas production;
            (17) the delivery of oil from Alberta, Canada, to domestic 
        markets in the United States is in the national interest of the 
        United States, and the earliest possible completion of the 
        Keystone XL pipeline will best serve the national interest;
            (18) there are 103 nuclear reactors currently operating in 
        the United States, providing 20 percent of the electricity of 
        the United States, slightly less than the electricity generated 
        by natural gas;
            (19) nuclear energy is the largest provider of clean, low-
        carbon electricity, almost 8 times larger than all renewable 
        power production combined, excluding hydroelectric power;
            (20) nuclear power is responsible for 72 percent of 
        emission-free electricity production in the United States;
            (21) nuclear power plants virtually eliminate emissions of 
        greenhouse gases and criteria pollutants associated with acid 
        rain, smog, or ozone;
            (22) nuclear energy supplies consistent, baseload 
        electricity, independent of environmental conditions;
            (23) between 1960 and 1980, the Nuclear Regulatory 
        Commission issued 169 permits to construct nuclear power 
        facilities;
            (24) even if every nuclear power plant is granted a 20-year 
        extension, all currently operating nuclear power plants will be 
        retired by 2055;
            (25) long lead times for nuclear power plant licensing, 
        permitting, and construction indicate that action to stimulate 
        the nuclear power industry should not be delayed;
            (26) there are 17 combined operating license applications 
        currently pending before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for 
        26 new reactors in the United States, with 4 applications 
        inactive due to regulatory uncertainty;
            (27) those proposed reactors will use the latest in nuclear 
        technology for efficiency and safety, more advanced than the 
        technology of the 1960s and 1970s found in the reactors 
        currently operating in the United States;
            (28) the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 
        et seq.) requires the Federal Government to take ownership of 
        high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel and build a 
        permanent geologic repository in which to store such waste;
            (29) the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended in 
        1987, selected the Yucca Mountain site to be the sole geologic 
        repository in which to store high-level radioactive waste and 
        spent nuclear fuel;
            (30) the Congress reaffirmed Yucca Mountain as the sole 
        candidate site for a geologic repository in 2001;
            (31) despite such laws, the Government has failed to accept 
        high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel from 
        utilities and has delayed construction of the Yucca Mountain 
        repository;
            (32) failure to accept high-level radioactive waste and 
        spent nuclear fuel has led to more than 74 lawsuits filed by 
        utilities against the Government, $1,000,000,000 in settlements 
        being paid, and an estimated $16,200,000,000 in potential 
        liabilities to settle remaining lawsuits;
            (33) each year the Government refuses to accept high-level 
        radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel adds an estimated 
        $500,000,000 in additional liabilities associated with future 
        lawsuits;
            (34) the failure of the Federal Government to accept high-
        level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel from utilities 
        is a significant barrier to the future development of 
        additional nuclear power;
            (35) the United States has 58,000 tons of radiological 
        material stored at more than 100 sites in 39 States;
            (36) the 103 commercial nuclear reactors operating in the 
        United States produce approximately 2,000 tons of spent nuclear 
        fuel every year;
            (37) the Yucca Mountain repository's capacity is 
        statutorily limited to 70,000 tons of waste but can safely hold 
        120,000 tons;
            (38) operators who have paid into the Nuclear Waste Fund 
        have been denied access to permanent storage of radiological 
        material as promised by the Federal Government;
            (39) permanent geologic storage capacity is a finite 
        resource on which the industry depends; and
            (40) operators have the technical expertise to develop new 
        and more efficient processes of disposing of new radiological 
        material, including finding repositories in addition to Yucca 
        Mountain.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) apply our founding principles as outlined in the 
        Declaration of Independence and Constitution to restore the 
        individual's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
        happiness by restoring a true all-of-the-above, free market, 
        all-American energy market in the United States;
            (2) promote expansion of domestic employment opportunities 
        through energy development on Federal lands and through less 
        intrusive government on private lands;
            (3) respond to the Nation's increased demand for domestic 
        energy resources, including oil and natural gas resources;
            (4) support the utilization of the outer Continental Shelf 
        for oil and gas production and transmission;
            (5) confirm and ensure the validity of oil and gas leases 
        issued under the Final Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas 
        Leasing Program, 2012-2017;
            (6) ensure the continued leasing of outer Continental Shelf 
        areas pursuant to the Final Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas 
        Leasing Program, 2012-2017;
            (7) facilitate interagency coordination and cooperation in 
        the processing of permits required to support oil and gas use 
        authorization on Federal lands, both onshore and on the outer 
        Continental Shelf, in order to achieve greater consistency, 
        certainty, and timeliness in permit processing requirements;
            (8) promote process streamlining and increased interagency 
        efficiency, including elimination of interagency duplication of 
        effort;
            (9) improve information sharing among agencies and 
        understanding of respective agency roles and responsibilities;
            (10) promote coordination with State agencies with 
        expertise and responsibilities related to Federal oil and gas 
        permitting decisions, and balance Federal interests with the 
        interests and well-being of State and local communities;
            (11) promote responsible stewardship of Federal oil and gas 
        resources;
            (12) maintain high standards of safety and environmental 
        protection; and
            (13) enhance the benefits to Federal permitting already 
        occurring as a result of a coordinated and timely interagency 
        process for oil and gas permit review for certain Federal oil 
        and gas leases.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to apply the principles of

        the Coastal Plain prepared pursuant to section 1002 of the 
        Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (16 
        U.S.C. 3142) and section 102(2)(C) of the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is 
        deemed to satisfy the requirements under the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 that apply with respect to 
        prelease activities, including actions authorized to be taken 
        by the Secretary to develop and promulgate the regulations for 
        the establishment of a leasing program authorized by this 
        subtitle before the conduct of the first lease sale.
            (3) Compliance with nepa for other actions.--Before 
        conducting the first lease sale under this subtitle, the 
        Secretary shall prepare an environmental impact statement under 
        the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 with respect to 
        the actions authorized by this subtitle that are not referred 
        to in paragraph (2). Notwithstanding any other law, the 
        Secretary is not required to identify nonleasing alternative 
        courses of action or to analyze the environmental effects of 
        such courses of action. The Secretary shall only identify a 
        preferred action for such leasing and a single leasing 
        alternative, and analyze the environmental effects and 
        potential mitigation measures for those two alternatives. The 
        identification of the preferred action and related analysis for 
        the first lease sale under this subtitle shall be completed 
        within 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act. The 
        Secretary shall only consider public comments that specifically 
        address the Secretary's preferred action and that are filed 
        within 20 days after publication of an environmental analysis.

        is deemed to satisfy all requirements for the analysis and 
        consideration of the environmental effects of proposed leasing 
        under this subtitle. In preparing or reviewing an environmental 
        assessment pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 
        1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and any regulations promulgated 
        thereto, an agency shall consider, in addition to any 
        mitigation required by the agency, all applicable Federal, 
        State, local, and other laws and regulations, guidelines, 
        permit conditions, and any other requirements and best 
        practices regarding a Priority Energy Project and any other 
        actions considered in a cumulative effects analysis. Pursuant 
        to that, the agency shall make a finding of no significant 
        impact or a mitigated finding of no significant impact, as 
        applicable, unless, presuming administrative regularity, the 
        agency can conclusively demonstrate that the mitigation 
        required by the agency and the applicable Federal, State, 
        local, and other laws and regulations, guidelines, permit 
        conditions, and any other requirements and best practices 
        regarding a Priority Energy Project and any other actions 
        considered in a cumulative effects analysis will not prevent or 
        otherwise mitigate a significant impact on the human 
        environment.

        that the Special Area is of such unique character and interest 
        so as to require special management and regulatory protection. 
        The Secretary shall designate as such a Special Area the 
        Sadlerochit Spring area, comprising approximately 4,000 acres.
            (2) Management.--Each such Special Area shall be managed so 
        as to protect and preserve the area's unique and diverse 
        character including its fish, wildlife, and subsistence 
        resource values.
            (3) Exclusion from leasing or surface occupancy.--The 
        Secretary may exclude any Special Area from leasing. If the 
        Secretary leases a Special Area, or any part thereof, for 
        purposes of oil and gas exploration, development, production, 
        and related activities, there shall be no surface occupancy of 
        the lands comprising the Special Area.

program is under judicial or administrative review pursuant to this 
Act, including any administrative review occasioned by the remand of

                result in any condition described in section 
                5(a)(2)(A)(i); and
                    ``(ii) such proposed activity cannot be modified to 
                avoid such condition.
            ``(B) The Secretary may request additional information from

        decision all record title holders of the lease may request 
        cancellation of the lease, and within 60 days after receipt of 
        such cancellation request the Secretary shall pay to the record 
        title holders the amount of any bonus bid paid for such lease.

and inserting ``Unless the Secretary issues a lease sooner, leases 
shall automatically issue exactly 60 days following payment by the 
successful bidder of the remainder of the bonus bid, if any, and the 
annual rental for the first lease year. The filing of any protest to 
the sale or issuance of a lease shall not act to extend the date by 
which the lease is to be issued following payment by the successful 
bidder under the preceding sentence, nor shall the issuance of a lease 
be delayed or deferred beyond 60 days following payment by the 
successful bidder pending resolution of a protest to the sale or 
issuance of the lease.''.

be brought not later than 60 days after the date of the decision or 
action giving rise to the claim.

                failure to act to the Federal or State administrative 
                agency or official, the Court shall set a reasonable 
                schedule and deadline for the agency or official to act

SEC. 701. LEGISLATIVE STAY.

    (a) Establishment of Standards.--In place of the rules specified in 
subsection (b), and notwithstanding the date by which such rules would 
otherwise be required to be promulgated, the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency (in this title referred to as the 
``Administrator'') shall--
            (1) propose regulations for industrial, commercial, and 
        institutional boilers and process heaters, and commercial and 
        industrial solid waste incinerator units, subject to any of the 
        rules specified in subsection (b)--
                    (A) establishing maximum achievable control 
                technology standards, performance standards, and other 
                requirements under sections 112 and 129, as applicable, 
                of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412, 7429); and
                    (B) identifying non-hazardous secondary materials 
                that, when used as fuels or ingredients in combustion 
                units of such boilers, process heaters, or incinerator 
                units are solid waste under the Solid Waste Disposal 
                Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.; commonly referred to as 
                the ``Resource Conservation and Recovery Act'') for 
                purposes of determining the extent to which such 
                combustion units are required to meet the emissions 
                standards under section 112 of the Clean Air Act (42 
                U.S.C. 7412) or the emission standards under section 
                129 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7429); and
            (2) finalize the regulations on the date that is 15 months 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (b) Stay of Earlier Rules.--The following rules are of no force or 
effect, shall be treated as though such rules had never taken effect, 
and shall be replaced as described in subsection (a):

    (a) Establishment of Compliance Dates.--For each regulation 
promulgated pursuant to section 701, the Administrator--
            (1) shall establish a date for compliance with standards 
        and requirements under such regulation that is, notwithstanding 
        any other provision of law, not earlier than 5 years after the 
        effective date of the regulation; and
            (2) in proposing a date for such compliance, shall take 
        into consideration--
                    (A) the costs of achieving emissions reductions;
                    (B) any non-air quality health and environmental 
                impact and energy requirements of the standards and

                    (E) potential net employment impacts.
    (b) New Sources.--The date on which the Administrator proposes a 
regulation pursuant to section 701(a)(1) establishing an emission 
standard under section 112 or 129 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412, 
7429) shall be treated as the date on which the Administrator first 
proposes such a regulation for purposes of applying the definition of a 
new source under section 112(a)(4) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(a)(4)) 
or the definition of a new solid waste incineration unit under section 
129(g)(2) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7429(g)(2)).
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this title shall be construed 
to restrict or otherwise affect the provisions of paragraphs (3)(B) and 
(4) of section 112(i) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(i)).

SEC. 703. ENERGY RECOVERY AND CONSERVATION.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and to ensure the 
recovery and conservation of energy consistent with the Solid Waste 
Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.; commonly referred to as the 
``Resource Conservation and Recovery Act''), in promulgating rules 
under section 701(a) addressing the subject matter of the rules 
specified in paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 701(b), the 
Administrator--
            (1) shall adopt the definitions of the terms ``commercial 
        and industrial solid waste incineration unit'', ``commercial 
        and industrial waste'', and ``contained gaseous material'' in 
        the rule entitled ``Standards of Performance for New Stationary 
        Sources and Emission Guidelines for Existing Sources: 
        Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units'', 
        published at 65 Fed. Reg. 75338 (December 1, 2000); and
            (2) shall identify non-hazardous secondary material to be 
        solid waste only if--
                    (A) the material meets such definition of 
                commercial and industrial waste; or
                    (B) if the material is a gas, it meets such 
                definition of contained gaseous material.

SEC. 704. OTHER PROVISIONS.

    (a) Establishment of Standards Achievable in Practice.--In 
promulgating rules under section 701(a), the Administrator shall ensure 
that emissions standards for existing and new sources established under 
section 112 or 129 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412, 7429), as 
applicable, can be met under actual operating conditions consistently 
and concurrently with emission standards for all other air pollutants 
regulated by the rule for the source category, taking into account 
variability in actual source performance, source design, fuels, inputs, 
controls, ability to measure the pollutant emissions, and operating 
conditions.
    (b) Regulatory Alternatives.--For each regulation promulgated 
pursuant to section 701(a), from among the range of regulatory 
alternatives authorized under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et 
seq.) including work practice standards under section 112(h) of such 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(h)), the Administrator shall impose the least 
burdensome, consistent with the purposes of such Act and Executive 
Order No. 13563 published at 76 Fed. Reg. 3821 (January 21, 2011).

determination do not warrant regulation under subtitle C of the Solid 
Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.).

SEC. 706. PROHIBITION ON USE OF SOCIAL COST OF CARBON IN ANALYSIS.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any 
Executive order, a Federal department or agency shall not use the 
social cost of carbon in order to incorporate social benefits of 
reducing carbon dioxide emissions, or for any other reason, in any 
cost-benefit analysis.
    (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``social cost of 
carbon'' means the social cost of carbon as described in the technical 
support document entitled ``Technical Support Document: Technical 
Update of the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 
Under Executive Order 12866'', published by the Interagency Working 
Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government, in May 2013, 
or any successor or substantially related document, or any other 
estimate of the monetized damages associated with an incremental 
increase in carbon dioxide emissions in a given year.

SEC. 707. CLARIFICATION OF LEGAL ENFORCEMENT AGAINST NONCRIMINAL ENERGY 
              PRODUCERS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) was enacted in 
        1918 to protect the migratory bird population from overhunting 
        and poaching and has not been updated to reflect the societal 
        changes that have occurred in our Nation over the last 95 
        years.
            (2) Anyone involved in an otherwise legal activity may be 
        subject to criminal liability for the unintentional death of 
        any one of over 1,000 species of birds protected under the 
        MBTA.
            (3) The Act of June 8, 1940 (chapter 278; 16 U.S.C. 668), 
        popularly known as the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act 
        (BGEPA), was first enacted in 1940 to protect the dwindling 
        population of bald eagles and amended in 1962 to cover golden 
        eagles in order to provide additional protective measures for 
        bald eagles and for other purposes.
            (4) The BGEPA includes a program for the Federal Government 
        to issue permits in order to protect companies from legal 
        liability if eagles are unintentionally injured or killed, but 
        the Federal Government has failed to issue permits issued under 
        the program.
            (5) Among other goals, the BGEPA's permit program was 
        established to assure the protection of interests fundamental 
        to the basic operation of our society like agriculture and 
        energy infrastructure development and maintenance.
            (6) The BGEPA was successful in helping the overall eagle 
        population recover, leading to bald eagles being removed from 
        the list of threatened and endangered species in 2007.
            (7) There are differing legal and judicial interpretations 
        regarding the scope of criminality in those statutes.
            (8) It appears criminal prosecution under those statutes 
        has been subjective, selective, and not applied uniformly and 
        fairly across all sectors of society.
            (9) Those statutes need to be updated to reflect 
        significant changes in our Nation over the last half century, 
        including the urbanization of rural areas and how domestic 
        energy is produced, transmitted, and distributed.
            (10) Protecting the avian population and its habitat is 
        important.
            (11) Federal enforcement actions should be appropriate, 
        uniform, nondiscriminatory, and just.
    (b) Permits for Incidental Take.--Section 1 of the Act of June 8, 
1940 (chapter 278; 16 U.S.C. 668), popularly known as the Bald and 
Golden Eagle Protection Act, is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
    ``(d) Permits for Incidental Take.--Upon submission of a 
substantially completed application, the Secretary shall issue or deny 
an eagle take permit for no less than 30 years under section 22.26 of 
title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, that authorizes taking of any 
bald eagle or golden eagle that is incidental to, but not the purpose 
of, an otherwise lawful activity. Failure to issue or deny such a 
permit within a reasonable time (which shall not exceed one year) is 
deemed issuance of such permit, and the applicant shall not be subject 
to liability for any incidental take of a bald eagle or golden eagle 
that is in conformity with the information submitted to the Secretary 
as part of the application for the permit.''.
    (c) Migratory Bird Treaty Act.--Section 6(a) of the Migratory Bird 
Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 707(a)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``shall'' the first and second place it 
        appears and inserting ``shall with intent knowingly''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following: ``For the purposes 
        of this subsection, `with intent knowingly' does not include 
        any taking, killing, or other harm to any migratory bird that 
        is accidental or incidental to the presence or operation of an 
        otherwise lawful activity.''.

              STATES.

    Section 181 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7511) is amended by 
adding at the end the following:
    ``(d) Extended Attainment Date for Certain Downwind Areas.--
            ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection:

                        `downwind area'); and
                            ``(ii) is either--

                                violation of section 110(a)(2)(D) and 
                                for which the Administrator has 
                                established requirements through notice 
                                and comment rulemaking to reduce the 
                                emissions causing such significant 
                                contribution.
                    ``(B) The term `current classification' means the 
                classification of a downwind area under this section at 
                the time of the determination under paragraph (2).
            ``(2) Extension.--Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2), a 
        downwind area that is not in attainment within 18 months of the 
        attainment deadline required under this section may seek an

        reclassification determination under subsection (b)(2)(A) for 
        such downwind area, and the Administrator approves a plan 
        consistent with subparagraphs (A) and (B) for such area, the 
        reclassification shall be withdrawn and, for purposes of 
        implementing the 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality 
        standard, the area shall be treated as if the reclassification

of the date of enactment of this Act. Such a schedule shall be 
presented to Congress within one year of the date of enactment of this 
Act.

SEC. 1205. TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL PLANT DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS.

    Within one year of the date of enactment of this Act, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission shall outline to the Congress an approach that 
will allow the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop technology-
neutral guidelines for nuclear plant licensing in the future that would 
allow for the more seamless entry of new technologies into the 
marketplace.

SEC. 1206. ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND PERSONNEL RESOURCES.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall transmit to the Congress a request
