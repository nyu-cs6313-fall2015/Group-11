  <summary>7/30/2014--Introduced.
Disabled Public Safety Officers Fairness Act of 2014 - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to provide for payment of disability benefits to public safety officers who became permanently and totally disabled prior to the enactment of such Act.

Allows a public safety officer seeking a benefit on the basis of having been permanently and totally disabled as the direct result of a catastrophic injury sustained in the line of duty before the enactment of such Act to file a claim during the same period that would be applicable to an officer disabled after the date of enactment, except that in lieu of such a period beginning on the date of the injury it shall begin on the date of the enactment of this Act.

Applies this Act to any public safety officer alive on or after enactment of this Act.</summary>
