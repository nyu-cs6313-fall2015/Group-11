                                 A BILL


 
To reform the verification and reporting processes for the health care 
                  premium and cost-sharing subsidies.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Streamlining Verification for 
Americans Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Employer reporting requirements under the Patient 
        Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) should 
        strike the appropriate balance between sufficient reporting to 
        enforce the law and protecting the privacy of individuals.
            (2) Protection of the privacy of the primary insured 
        individual and each other individual covered under the policy, 
        which should include minimizing the transmittal of social 
        security numbers, should be a priority when implementing 
        reporting requirements.

SEC. 3. IMPROVING THE ACCURACY OF EXCHANGE DETERMINATIONS OF 
              ELIGIBILITY FOR PREMIUM ASSISTANCE TAX CREDITS.

    (a) In General.--If an employer provides prospective reporting for 
any calendar year under subsection (b), such employer shall be treated 
as making the return described in section 6056(b) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 for such year if such return contains, consistent 
with the requirements of subsection (c)(2), only information with 
respect to employees with respect to whom the employer has received a 
notification under section 1411(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18081(e)(4)(B)(iii)). If the 
preceding sentence applies to any employer for any calendar year, such 
employer shall be treated as furnishing the statements required under 
section 6056(c) of such Code, if the employer furnishes such statements 
to such employees with respect to the information included in the 
return made under the preceding sentence.
    (b) Prospective Reporting.--Not later than 60 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the 
Secretary of Labor, and the Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration, shall implement a reporting system under which an 
employer may elect to provide the following information with respect to 
a calendar year before the beginning of such year:
            (1) The name, date, and employer identification number of 
        the employer.
            (2) A certification as to whether the employer offers to 
        its full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in minimum 
        essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan 
        (as defined in section 5000A(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code 
        of 1986) and whether the employer offers the spouses of such 
        full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in such coverage.
            (3) The months during the year for which coverage is 
        generally available to full-time employees.
            (4) A certification as to whether the coverage described in 
        paragraph (2) satisfies the requirements to qualify for one of 
        the affordability safe harbors promulgated by the Secretary of 
        the Treasury for purposes of section 4980H of the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986.
            (5) A certification as to whether an employee's effective 
        date of coverage is generally affected by a waiting period.
    (c) Requirements.--The reporting system established under 
subsection (b) shall provide for--
            (1) the processes necessary to ensure that Exchanges can 
        access the information described in subsection (b) to assist in 
        verifying eligibility determinations for advance payment of the 
        premium tax credits under section 36B of the Internal Revenue 
        Code of 1986 and the cost-sharing subsidies under section 1402 
        of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 
        18071); and
            (2) guidance on how employers who voluntarily report in 
        advance under this section could satisfy the report and 
        statement requirements under subsections (b) and (c) of section 
        6056 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by reporting only 
        with respect to employees with respect to whom the employer has 
        received a notification under section 1411(e)(4)(B)(iii) of the 
        Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 
        18081(e)(4)(B)(iii)).

        shall include allowing an individual to have eligibility 
        determined on the basis of household income for a later period 
        or on the basis of the individual's estimate of such income for 
        the taxable year.''.
