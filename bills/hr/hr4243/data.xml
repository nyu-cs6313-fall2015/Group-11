  <summary>3/13/2014--Introduced.
Authorizes the Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police to:

 issue a permit authorizing a person to engage in appropriate commercial filmmaking and photography activity on the Capitol grounds, except for certain Capitol buildings, structures, and areas; and require the person to whom the permit is issued, under its terms and conditions, to pay an appropriate fee to cover any costs incurred by the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) resulting from the issuance. Considers the activity and fee appropriate only if:

 the activity is similar to the types of commercial activity permitted in Union Square before its transfer of jurisdiction and control to the AOC under the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2012; and the fee is similar to the fee collected by the Director of the National Park Service for commercial activity permitted in Union Square before the transfer. Requires the Chief to transfer the fees to the Capitol Trust Account established under the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2014.</summary>
