    (a) Limitation.--None of the funds authorized to be appropriated or 
otherwise made available for the Department of Defense may be obligated 
or expended to retire, prepare to retire, or place in storage any A-10 
aircraft until each of the following occurs:
            (1) The Secretary of the Air Force certifies to the 
        congressional defense committees each of the following:
                    (A) That the F-35A aircraft has achieved full 
                operational capability.
                    (B) That the F-35A aircraft has achieved Block 4A 
                capabilities, including--
                            (i) an enhanced electronic warfare 
                        capability that will allow the F-35A aircraft 
                        to counter emerging threats in a close air 
                        support (CAS) environment; and

                    (C) That a number of F-35A aircraft exists in the 
                Air Force inventory in sufficient quantity to replace 
                the A-10 aircraft being retired in order to meet close 
                air support capability requirements of the combatant 
                commands.
            (2) The Comptroller General of the United States submits to 
        the congressional defense committees a report setting forth the 
        following:
                    (A) An assessment whether each certification under

                sufficiently detailed.
                    (B) An identification of any shortcomings, 
                limitations, or other reportable matters that affect 
                the quality or findings of any certification under 
                paragraph (1).
    (b) Deadline for Submittal of Comptroller General Report.--The 
report of the Comptroller General under paragraph (2) of subsection (a)
