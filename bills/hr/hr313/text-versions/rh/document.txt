To amend title 5, United States Code, to institute spending limits and 
      transparency requirements for Federal conference and travel 
                 expenditures, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Government Spending Accountability 
Act of 2013'' or the ``GSA Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. LIMITS AND TRANSPARENCY FOR CONFERENCE AND TRAVEL SPENDING.

    (a) Amendment.--Chapter 57 of title 5, United States Code, is 
amended by inserting after section 5711 the following:
``Sec. 5712. Limits and transparency for conference and travel spending
    ``(a) Conference Transparency and Spending Limits.--
            ``(1) Public availability of conference materials.--Each 
        agency shall post on the public website of that agency detailed 
        information on any presentation made by any employee of that 
        agency at a conference (except to the extent the head of an 
        agency excludes such information for reasons of national 
        security) including--
                    ``(A) the prepared text of any verbal presentation 
                made; and
                    ``(B) any visual, digital, video, or audio 
                materials presented, including photographs, slides, and 
                audio-visual recordings.
            ``(2) Limits on amount expended on a conference.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), an agency may not expend more than 
                $500,000 to support a single conference.
                    ``(B) Exception.--The head of an agency may waive 
                the limitation in subparagraph (A) for a specific 
                conference after making a determination that the 
                expenditure is justified as the most cost-effective 
                option to achieve a compelling purpose. The head of an 
                agency shall submit to the appropriate congressional 
                committees a report on any waiver granted under this 
                subparagraph, including the justification for such 
                waiver.
                    ``(C) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed to preclude an agency from 
                receiving financial support or other assistance from a 
                private entity to pay or defray the costs of a 
                conference the total cost of which exceeds $500,000.
    ``(b) International Conference Rule.--An agency may not pay the 
travel expenses for more than 50 employees of that agency who are 
stationed in the United States, for any international conference, 
unless the Secretary of State determines that attendance for such 
employees is in the national interest, or the head of the agency 
determines that attendance for such employees is critical to the 
agency's mission. The Secretary of State and the head of an agency 
shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on 
any waiver granted under this subsection, including the justification 
for such waiver.
    ``(c) Reporting on Travel and Conference Expenses Required.--At the 
beginning of each quarter of each fiscal year, each agency shall post 
on the public website of that agency a report on each conference that 
costs more than $10,000 for which the agency paid travel expenses 
during the preceding 3 months that includes--
            ``(1) the itemized expenses paid by the agency, including 
        travel, lodging, and meal expenses, and any other agency 
        expenditures to otherwise support the conference;
            ``(2) the primary sponsor of the conference;
            ``(3) the location of the conference;
            ``(4) the date of the conference;
            ``(5) a brief explanation of how the participation of 
        employees from such agency at the conference advanced the 
        mission of the agency;
            ``(6) the title of any employee, or any individual who is 
        not a Federal employee, whose travel expenses or other 
        conference expenses were paid by the agency;
            ``(7) the total number of individuals whose travel expenses 
        or other conference expenses were paid by the agency; and
            ``(8) in the case of a conference for which that agency was 
        the primary sponsor, a statement that--
                    ``(A) describes the cost to the agency of selecting 
                the specific conference venue;
                    ``(B) describes why the location was selected, 
                including a justification for such selection;
                    ``(C) demonstrates the cost efficiency of the 
                location;
                    ``(D) provides a cost benefit analysis of holding a 
                conference rather than conducting a teleconference; and
                    ``(E) describes any financial support or other 
                assistance from a private entity used to pay or defray 
                the costs of the conference, and for each case where 
                such support or assistance was used, the head of the 
                agency shall include a certification that there is no 
                conflict of interest resulting from such support or 
                assistance.
    ``(d) Format and Publication of Reports.--Each report posted on the 
public website under subsection (c) shall--
            ``(1) be in a searchable electronic format; and
