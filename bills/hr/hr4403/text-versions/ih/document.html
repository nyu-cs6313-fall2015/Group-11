                        distributions for any taxable year with respect 
                        to any federally declared disaster shall not

                        a distribution to an individual would (without 
                        regard to clause (i)) be a qualified natural 
                        disaster distribution, a plan shall not be 
                        treated as violating any requirement of this 
                        title merely because the plan treats such

                        subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 
                        414.
                    ``(C) Amount distributed may be repaid.--Any 
                individual who receives a qualified natural disaster

                beginning on the day after the date on which such 
                distribution was received, make one or more 
                contributions to an individual retirement plan of such 
                individual in an aggregate amount not to exceed the 
                amount of such distribution. The dollar limitations 
                otherwise applicable to contributions to individual 
                retirement plans shall not apply to any contribution 
                made pursuant to the preceding sentence. No deduction 
                shall be allowed for any contribution pursuant to this 
                subparagraph.

    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to distributions made after the date of the enactment of this 
Act.
