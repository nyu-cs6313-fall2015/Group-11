``PART D--COOPERATIVE GOVERNING OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE

``SEC. 2795. DEFINITIONS.

    ``In this part:
            ``(1) Primary state.--The term `primary State' means, with 
        respect to individual health insurance coverage offered by a 
        health insurance issuer, the State designated by the issuer as 
        the State whose covered laws shall govern the health insurance 
        issuer in the sale of such coverage under this part. An issuer, 
        with respect to a particular policy, may only designate one 
        such State as its primary State with respect to all such 
        coverage it offers. Such an issuer may not change the 
        designated primary State with respect to individual health 
        insurance coverage once the policy is issued, except that such 
        a change may be made upon renewal of the policy. With respect 
        to such designated State, the issuer is deemed to be doing 
        business in that State.
            ``(2) Secondary state.--The term `secondary State' means, 
        with respect to individual health insurance coverage offered by 
        a health insurance issuer, any State that is not the primary 
        State. In the case of a health insurance issuer that is selling 
        a policy in, or to a resident of, a secondary State, the issuer 
        is deemed to be doing business in that secondary State.
            ``(3) Health insurance issuer.--The term `health insurance 
        issuer' has the meaning given such term in section 2791(b)(2), 
        except that such an issuer must be licensed in the primary 
        State and be qualified to sell individual health insurance 
        coverage in that State.
            ``(4) Individual health insurance coverage.--The term 
        `individual health insurance coverage' means health insurance 
        coverage offered in the individual market, as defined in 
        section 2791(e)(1).
            ``(5) Applicable state authority.--The term `applicable 
        State authority' means, with respect to a health insurance 
        issuer in a State, the State insurance commissioner or official 
        or officials designated by the State to enforce the 
        requirements of this title for the State with respect to the 
        issuer.

        financial condition' means that, based on its present or

                respect to known claims and reasonably anticipated

arrangement, or other financial arrangement as the applicable authority 
determines to be adequate to enable the plan to fully meet all its 
financial obligations on a timely basis and is otherwise no less 
protective of the interests of participants and beneficiaries than the 
requirements for which it is substituted. The applicable authority may 
take into account, for purposes of this subsection, evidence provided 
by the plan or sponsor which demonstrates an assumption of liability 
with respect to the plan. Such evidence may be in the form of a 
contract of indemnification, lien, bonding, insurance, letter of

                insurance coverage (as defined in section 812(a)(3)), 
                such State shall be the State with which filing and 
                approval of a policy type offered by the plan was 
                initially obtained, and
                    ``(B) in any other case, the Secretary shall take

    (b) Treatment of Certain Existing Health Benefits Programs.--
            (1) In general.--In any case in which, as of the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, an arrangement is maintained in a 
        State for the purpose of providing benefits consisting of 
        medical care for the employees and beneficiaries of its 
        participating employers, at least 200 participating employers 
        make contributions to such arrangement, such arrangement has 
        been in existence for at least 10 years, and such arrangement 
        is licensed under the laws of one or more States to provide 
        such benefits to its participating employers, upon the filing 
        with the applicable authority (as defined in section 812(a)(5) 
        of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (as 
        amended by this subtitle)) by the arrangement of an application 
        for certification of the arrangement under part 8 of subtitle B 
        of title I of such Act--
                    (A) such arrangement shall be deemed to be a group 
                health plan for purposes of title I of such Act;
                    (B) the requirements of sections 801(a) and 803(a)

                shall be deemed met with respect to such arrangement;
                    (C) the requirements of section 803(b) of such Act 
                shall be deemed met, if the arrangement is operated by 
                a board of directors which--
                            (i) is elected by the participating 
                        employers, with each employer having one vote; 
                        and
                            (ii) has complete fiscal control over the 
                        arrangement and which is responsible for all 
                        operations of the arrangement;
                    (D) the requirements of section 804(a) of such Act 
                shall be deemed met with respect to such arrangement; 
                and
                    (E) the arrangement may be certified by any 
                applicable authority with respect to its operations in 
                any State only if it operates in such State on the date

        The provisions of this subsection shall cease to apply with 
        respect to any such arrangement at such time after the date of

            (2) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection, the 
        terms ``group health plan'', ``medical care'', and

        1974, except that the reference in paragraph (7) of such 
        section to an ``association health plan'' shall be deemed a 
        reference to an arrangement referred to in this subsection.

                TITLE V--REFORMING MEDICAL LIABILITY LAW

SEC. 501. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.

    The time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit shall be 3 
years after the date of manifestation of injury or 1 year after the 
claimant discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should 
have discovered, the injury, whichever occurs first. In no event shall 
the time for commencement of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after 
the date of manifestation of injury unless tolled for any of the 
following--
            (1) upon proof of fraud;
            (2) intentional concealment; or
            (3) the presence of a foreign body, which has no 
        therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the person of 
        the injured person.
Actions by a minor shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of 
the alleged manifestation of injury except that actions by a minor 
under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 years of 
manifestation of injury or prior to the minor's 8th birthday, whichever 
provides a longer period. Such time limitation shall be tolled for 
minors for any period during which a parent or guardian and a health 
care provider or health care organization have committed fraud or 
collusion in the failure to bring an action on behalf of the injured 
minor.

SEC. 502. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.

    (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses in 
Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, nothing in this 
subtitle shall limit a claimant's recovery of the full amount of the 
available economic damages, notwithstanding the limitation in 
subsection (b).
    (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--In any health care lawsuit, 
the amount of noneconomic damages, if available, may be as much as 
$250,000, regardless of the number of parties against whom the action 
is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with 
respect to the same injury.
    (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--For purposes of 
applying the limitation in subsection (b), future noneconomic damages 
shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not be 
informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. An award for 
noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall be reduced either 
before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the judgment after 
entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be made before accounting 
for any other reduction in damages required by law. If separate awards 
are rendered for past and future noneconomic damages and the combined 
awards exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be reduced 
first.
    (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each party shall 
be liable for that party's several share of any damages only and not 
for the share of any other person. Each party shall be liable only for 
the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to 
such party's percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of 
liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment shall be 
rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to such 
party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine 
the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant's harm.

SEC. 503. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.

    (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to 
Claimants.--In any health care lawsuit, the court shall supervise the 
arrangements for payment of damages to protect against conflicts of 
interest that may have the effect of reducing the amount of damages 
awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In particular, in any 
health care lawsuit in which the attorney for a party claims a 
financial stake in the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court 
shall have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage 
recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the claimant 
based upon the interests of justice and principles of equity. In no 
event shall the total of all contingent fees for representing all 
claimants in a health care lawsuit exceed the following limits:
            (1) Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the 
        claimant(s).
            (2) Thirty-three and one-third percent of the next $50,000 
        recovered by the claimant(s).
            (3) Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000 recovered by 
        the claimant(s).
            (4) Fifteen percent of any amount by which the recovery by 
        the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.
    (b) Applicability.--The limitations in this section shall apply 
whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, mediation, 
arbitration, or any other form of alternative dispute resolution. In a 
health care lawsuit involving a minor or incompetent person, a court 
retains the authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than 
the maximum permitted under this section. The requirement for court 
supervision in the first two sentences of subsection (a) applies only 
in civil actions.

SEC. 504. PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

    (a) In General.--Punitive damages may, if otherwise permitted by 
applicable State or Federal law, be awarded against any person in a 
health care lawsuit only if it is proven by clear and convincing 
evidence that such person acted with malicious intent to injure the 
claimant, or that such person deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary 
injury that such person knew the claimant was substantially certain to 
suffer. In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory 
damages is rendered against such person, no punitive damages may be 
awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit. No demand for 
punitive damages shall be included in a health care lawsuit as 
initially filed. A court may allow a claimant to file an amended 
pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the claimant and 
after a finding by the court, upon review of supporting and opposing 
affidavits or after a hearing, after weighing the evidence, that the 
claimant has established by a substantial probability that the claimant 
will prevail on the claim for punitive damages. At the request of any 
party in a health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a 
separate proceeding--
            (1) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the 
        amount of such award; and
            (2) the amount of punitive damages following a 
        determination of punitive liability.
If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only to the 
claim for punitive damages, as determined by applicable State law, 
shall be inadmissible in any proceeding to determine whether 
compensatory damages are to be awarded.
    (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--
            (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of 
        punitive damages, if awarded, in a health care lawsuit, the 
        trier of fact shall consider only the following--
                    (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct 
                of such party;
                    (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment 
                of it by such party;
                    (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;
                    (D) the number of products sold or medical 
                procedures rendered for compensation, as the case may 
                be, by such party, of the kind causing the harm 
                complained of by the claimant;
                    (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, 
                as a result of the conduct complained of by the 
                claimant; and
                    (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against 
                such party as a result of the conduct complained of by 
                the claimant.
            (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages, if 
        awarded, in a health care lawsuit may be as much as $250,000 or 
        as much as two times the amount of economic damages awarded, 
        whichever is greater. The jury shall not be informed of this 
        limitation.
    (c) No Punitive Damages for Products That Comply With FDA 
Standards.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) No punitive damages may be awarded against the 
                manufacturer or distributor of a medical product, or a 
                supplier of any component or raw material of such 
                medical product, based on a claim that such product 
                caused the claimant's harm where--
                            (i)(I) such medical product was subject to 
                        premarket approval, clearance, or licensure by 
                        the Food and Drug Administration with respect 
                        to the safety of the formulation or performance 
                        of the aspect of such medical product which 
                        caused the claimant's harm or the adequacy of 
                        the packaging or labeling of such medical 
                        product; and
                            (II) such medical product was so approved, 
                        cleared, or licensed; or
                            (ii) such medical product is generally 
                        recognized among qualified experts as safe and 
                        effective pursuant to conditions established by 
                        the Food and Drug Administration and applicable 
                        Food and Drug Administration regulations, 
                        including without limitation those related to 
                        packaging and labeling, unless the Food and 
                        Drug Administration has determined that such 
                        medical product was not manufactured or 
                        distributed in substantial compliance with 
                        applicable Food and Drug Administration 
                        statutes and regulations.
                    (B) Rule of construction.--Subparagraph (A) may not 
                be construed as establishing the obligation of the Food 
                and Drug Administration to demonstrate affirmatively 
                that a manufacturer, distributor, or supplier referred 
                to in such subparagraph meets any of the conditions 
                described in such subparagraph.
            (2) Liability of health care providers.--A health care 
        provider who prescribes, or who dispenses pursuant to a 
        prescription, a medical product approved, licensed, or cleared 
        by the Food and Drug Administration shall not be named as a 
        party to a product liability lawsuit involving such product and 
        shall not be liable to a claimant in a class action lawsuit 
        against the manufacturer, distributor, or seller of such 
        product. Nothing in this paragraph prevents a court from 
        consolidating cases involving health care providers and cases 
        involving products liability claims against the manufacturer, 
        distributor, or product seller of such medical product.
            (3) Packaging.--In a health care lawsuit for harm which is 
        alleged to relate to the adequacy of the packaging or labeling 
        of a drug which is required to have tamper-resistant packaging 
        under regulations of the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
        (including labeling regulations related to such packaging), the 
        manufacturer or product seller of the drug shall not be held 
        liable for punitive damages unless such packaging or labeling 
        is found by the trier of fact by clear and convincing evidence 
        to be substantially out of compliance with such regulations.
            (4) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any health 
        care lawsuit in which--
                    (A) a person, before or after premarket approval, 
                clearance, or licensure of such medical product, 
                knowingly misrepresented to or withheld from the Food 
                and Drug Administration information that is required to 
                be submitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
                Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) or section 351 of the 
                Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) that is 
                material and is causally related to the harm which the 
                claimant allegedly suffered; or
                    (B) a person made an illegal payment to an official 
                of the Food and Drug Administration for the purpose of 
                either securing or maintaining approval, clearance, or 
                licensure of such medical product.

SEC. 505. AUTHORIZATION OF PAYMENT OF FUTURE DAMAGES TO CLAIMANTS IN 
              HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.

    (a) In General.--In any health care lawsuit, if an award of future 
damages, without reduction to present value, equaling or exceeding 
$50,000 is made against a party with sufficient insurance or other 
assets to fund a periodic payment of such a judgment, the court shall, 
at the request of any party, enter a judgment ordering that the future 
damages be paid by periodic payments, in accordance with the Uniform 
Periodic Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National 
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.
    (b) Applicability.--This section applies to all actions which have 
not been first set for trial or retrial before the effective date of 
this Act.

        or such an action is brought, whether deceased, incompetent, or 
        a minor.
            (3) Compensatory damages.--The term ``compensatory 
        damages'' means objectively verifiable monetary losses incurred 
        as a result of the provision of, use of, or payment for (or 
        failure to provide, use, or pay for) health care services or 
        medical products, such as past and future medical expenses, 
        loss of past and future earnings, cost of obtaining domestic 
        services, loss of employment, and loss of business or

        liability claim. Such term does not include a claim or action 
        which is based on criminal liability; which seeks civil fines

        of medical treatment that a patient is otherwise qualified to 
        receive with the intent of causing or hastening the patient's 
        death against the wishes of the patient, or, if the patient is 
        incompetent, against the wishes of the individual or

SEC. 507. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.

    (a) Vaccine Injury.--
            (1) To the extent that title XXI of the Public Health 
        Service Act establishes a Federal rule of law applicable to a 
        civil action brought for a vaccine-related injury or death--
                    (A) this subtitle does not affect the application 
                of the rule of law to such an action; and
                    (B) any rule of law prescribed by this subtitle in 
                conflict with a rule of law of such title XXI shall not 
                apply to such action.
            (2) If there is an aspect of a civil action brought for a 
        vaccine-related injury or death to which a Federal rule of law 
        under title XXI of the Public Health Service Act does not 
        apply, then this subtitle or otherwise applicable law (as 
        determined under this subtitle) will apply to such aspect of 
        such action.
    (b) Other Federal Law.--Except as provided in this section, nothing 
in this subtitle shall be deemed to affect any defense available to a 
defendant in a health care lawsuit or action under any other provision 
of Federal law.

SEC. 508. STATE FLEXIBILITY AND PROTECTION OF STATES' RIGHTS.

    (a) Health Care Lawsuits.--The provisions governing health care 
lawsuits set forth in this subtitle preempt, subject to subsections (b) 
and (c), State law to the extent that State law prevents the 
application of any provisions of law established by or under this 
subtitle. The provisions governing health care lawsuits set forth in 
this subtitle supersede chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code, to 
the extent that such chapter--
            (1) provides for a greater amount of damages or contingent 
        fees, a longer period in which a health care lawsuit may be 
        commenced, or a reduced applicability or scope of periodic 
        payment of future damages, than provided in this subtitle; or
            (2) prohibits the introduction of evidence regarding 
        collateral source benefits, or mandates or permits subrogation 
        or a lien on collateral source benefits.
    (b) Protection of States' Rights and Other Laws.--(1) Any issue 
that is not governed by any provision of law established by or under 
this subtitle (including State standards of negligence) shall be 
governed by otherwise applicable State or Federal law.
    (2) This subtitle shall not preempt or supersede any State or 
Federal law that imposes greater procedural or substantive protections 
for health care providers and health care organizations from liability, 
loss, or damages than those provided by this subtitle or create a cause 
of action.
    (c) State Flexibility.--No provision of this subtitle shall be 
construed to preempt--
            (1) any State law (whether effective before, on, or after 
        the date of the enactment of this Act) that specifies a 
        particular monetary amount of compensatory or punitive damages 
        (or the total amount of damages) that may be awarded in a 
        health care lawsuit, regardless of whether such monetary amount 
        is greater or lesser than is provided for under this subtitle, 
        notwithstanding section 4(a); or
            (2) any defense available to a party in a health care 
        lawsuit under any other provision of State or Federal law.

SEC. 509. APPLICABILITY; EFFECTIVE DATE.

    This subtitle shall apply to any health care lawsuit brought in a 
Federal or State court, or subject to an alternative dispute resolution 
system, that is initiated on or after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, except that any health care lawsuit arising from an injury 
occurring prior to the date of the enactment of this Act shall be 
governed by the applicable statute of limitations provisions in effect 
at the time the injury occurred.

                    TITLE VI--RESPECTING HUMAN LIFE

SEC. 601. SPECIAL RULES REGARDING ABORTION.

    (a) Prohibition on Abortion Mandates.--Nothing in this Act (or any 
amendment made by this Act) shall be construed to require any health 
plan (including any high risk pool described in section 311) to provide 
coverage of or access to abortion services or to allow the Secretary of 
the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, or any other Federal or non-Federal person or entity in 
implementing this Act (or amendment) to require coverage of, or access 
to, abortion services.
    (b) Limitation on Abortion Funding.--
            (1) In general.--No funds authorized or appropriated by 
        this Act (or an amendment made by this Act) may be used to pay 
        for any abortion or to cover any part of the costs of any 
        health plan that includes coverage of abortion (including a 
        high risk pool described in section 311), except--
                    (A) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of 
                rape or incest; or
                    (B) in the case where a pregnant female suffers 
                from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical 
                illness that would, as certified by a physician, place 
                the female in danger of death unless an abortion is 
                performed, including a life-endangering physical 
                condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy 
                itself.
            (2) Option to purchase separate coverage or plan.--Nothing 
        in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting any non-
        Federal entity (including an individual or a State or local 
        government) from purchasing separate coverage for abortions for 
        which funding is prohibited under this subsection, or a health 
        plan that includes such abortions, so long as such coverage or 
        plan is paid for entirely using only funds not authorized or 
        appropriated by this Act.
            (3) Option to offer coverage or plan.--Nothing in this 
        subsection shall restrict any non-Federal health insurance 
        issuer offering a health plan from offering separate coverage 
        for abortions for which funding is prohibited under this 
        subsection, or a health plan that includes such abortions, so 
        long as--
                    (A) premiums for such separate coverage or plan are 
                paid for entirely with funds not authorized or 
                appropriated by this Act; and
                    (B) administrative costs and all services offered 
                through such coverage or plan are paid for using only 
                premiums collected for such coverage or plan.
            (4) Administrative expenses.--No funds authorized or 
        appropriated by this Act shall be available to pay for 
        administrative expenses in connection with any health plan 
        (including an Association Health Plan that has entered into 
        trusteeship) which provides any benefits or coverage for 
        abortions except where the life of the mother would be 
        endangered if the fetus were carried to term, or the pregnancy 
        is the result of an act of rape or incest.
    (c) No Preemption of State Laws.--Nothing in this Act (or an 
amendment made by this Act) shall be construed to preempt or otherwise 
have any effect on State laws protecting conscience rights, restricting 
or prohibiting abortion or coverage or funding of abortion (including 
State laws opting out of abortion coverage pursuant to section 1303 of 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Public Law 111-148), as 
in effect before the date of the enactment of this Act, or establishing 
procedural requirements on abortions, including parental notification 
or consent for the performance of an abortion on a minor.
