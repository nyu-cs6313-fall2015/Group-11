Caps the total amount of interest that can accrue during a borrower's grace and repayment periods at 50% of the total amount of their IDEA Loan.\n\nBlocks the accrual of interest on IDEA Loans for active duty military personnel.\n\nAllows student borrowers to consolidate FFELs, DLs, and Perkins Loans into IDEA Consolidation Loans that bear interest at an annual rate that equals the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans consolidated.\n\nDirects the Secretary of the Treasury to establish an IDEA Loan Repayment Program that: (1) repays IDEA loans through wage withholding and quarterly estimated tax payments, and (2) provides the Secretary of Education with the tax return information for each borrower that is necessary to determine the borrower's income-based repayment obligation.\n\nSets the annual repayment obligation for borrowers at an amount equal to 15% of the excess of their taxable income over the sum of: (1) an exemption amount equal to 150% of the federal poverty level for their household; and (2) the lesser $3,000 or specified income other than wages, salaries, tips and other employee compensation.\n\nSets the income-based repayment obligation of individuals who are not required to file a tax return at zero.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Education to provide borrowers, through the Internet, with a tool that has an interface that enables them to manage their IDEA Loans.\n\nAllows borrowers to prepay all or part of an IDEA Loan without penalty.\n\nPenalizes borrowers who fail to pay their full repayment amount for a taxable year.\n\nAmends the Social Security Act to give the Secretary of Education access to the information in the National Directory of New Hires to determine when IDEA borrowers in repayment status are hired and to inform them of their obligation to provide their employer with accurate loan information for wage withholding purposes.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to include IDEA loan withholding information on W-2 forms and to require the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose borrowers' tax return information to the Department of Education for IDEA program purposes.\n\nMakes specified FFEL and DL loan repayment or forgiveness programs applicable to IDEA Loans.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that any federal loan repayment or forgiveness program outside of the HEA that is available to students with DLs should be available to students with IDEA Loans."
