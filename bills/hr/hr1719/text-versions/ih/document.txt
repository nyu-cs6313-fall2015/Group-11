                    ``(B) meet such other specifications as the 
                Secretary may determine to be appropriate.
            ``(2) Treatment.--The one-cent, five-cent, dime, and 
        quarter dollar coins shall be treated in such a manner that the 
        appearance of the coins, both when new and after they have been 
        in circulation, is similar to the one-cent, five-cent, dime, 
        and quarter dollar coins, respectively, produced before the 
        date of the enactment of this subsection.
            ``(3) Buy american steel requirement.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other 
                provision of law, the Secretary shall, in minting one-
                cent, five-cent, dime, and quarter dollar coins, only

                    ``(B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply 
                if the Secretary finds, and publishes in the Federal 
                Register the basis of such finding, that--
                            ``(i) applying subparagraph (A) would be 
                        inconsistent with the public interest; or
                            ``(ii) an adequate supply of an appropriate 
                        grade of steel is not produced in the United 
                        States in sufficient and reasonably available 
                        quantities.''.
    (b) Conversion to New Coin Specifications.--In setting 
specifications under section 5112(w) of title 31, United States Code, 
as added by subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury shall not set

        handling equipment to accommodate all coins produced pursuant 
        to such subsection;
            (2) facilitate or allow the use of a coin with a lesser 
        value produced by another country, or the use of any token or 
        other easily or regularly produced metal device of minimal 
        value, in the place of a circulating coin produced by the 
        Secretary; or
            (3) require non-trivial changes to coin-accepting or coin 
        handling equipment to easily accommodate continued co-
        circulation of both coins produced with the new specifications 
        under such subsection and coins produced on or before the date 
        that is the end of the 90-day period beginning on the date of 
        the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
        apply to all one-cent, five-cent, dime, and quarter dollar 
        coins issued after the end of the 90-day period beginning on 
        the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (2) Exception.--The Secretary of the Treasury may produce 
        numismatic versions of the one-cent, five-cent, dime, and 
        quarter dollar coins either in the composition specified in 
        section 5112(w) of title 31, United States Code, as added by 
        subsection (a), or in forms and materials similar to those the 
        Secretary produced before the date of the enactment of this 
        Act.
