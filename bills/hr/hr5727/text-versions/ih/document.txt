 States Government that they are not boycotting persons, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

    (a) Declaration of Policy.--Section 3(5)(A) of the Export 
Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. 2402(5)(A)), as in effect 
pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), is amended to read as follows:
                    ``(A) to oppose restrictive trade practices or 
                boycotts against other countries friendly to the United 
                States or against any United States person;''.
    (b) Modification of the FAR.--
            (1) Certification.--Not later than the 90th day after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal Acquisition 
        Regulation shall be revised to require a certification from 
        each person that is a prospective contractor that the person, 
        and any person owned or controlled by the person, is not a 
        boycotting person.
            (2) Waiver.--The President may on a case-by-case basis 
        waive the requirement that a person make a certification under 
        paragraph (1) if the President determines and certifies in 
        writing to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
        Urban Affairs of the Senate that it is essential to the 
        national security interests of the United States to do so.
    (c) False Certifications.--
            (1) Penalties.--If the head of an executive agency 
        determines that a person has submitted a false certification 
        under subsection (b) on or after the date on which the revision 
        of the Federal Acquisition Regulation required by subsection 
        (b) becomes effective, the head of that executive agency shall 
        terminate any contract with such person and debar and suspend 
        such person from eligibility for Federal contracts for a period 
        of not less than 2 years. Any such debarment and suspension 
        shall be subject to the procedures that apply to debarment and 
        suspension under the Federal Acquisition Regulation under 
        subpart 9.4 of part 9 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.
            (2) Inclusion on list of debarred contractors.--The 
        Administrator of General Services shall include on the listing 
        of contractors debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment 
        that is maintained by the Administrator under subpart 9.4 of 
        the Federal Acquisition Regulation each person that is 
        debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment or suspension by 
        the head of an executive agency on the basis of a determination 
        of a false certification under paragraph (1).

                has a free trade agreement and which is not itself the 
                object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States
