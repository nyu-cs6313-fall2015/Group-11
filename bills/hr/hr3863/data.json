Requires the Comptroller General (GAO), for purposes of congressional review, to examine and report on: (1)\u00a0each agency cost-benefit analysis for compliance with the requirements of this Act, including\u00a0the agency methodology for such analysis; (2) risk analysis pertaining to the cost-benefit analysis; and (3) agency quadrennial regulatory reviews for consistency with the requirements of this Act."
