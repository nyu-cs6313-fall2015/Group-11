                                 A BILL


 
     To provide that the Ozark National Scenic Riverways shall be 
 administered in accordance with the general management plan for that 
       unit of the National Park System, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The tourism industry that is driven by the Ozark 
        National Scenic Riverways is the economic backbone of the 
        surrounding area. Promoting tourism and public access to 
        Federal lands goes hand-in-hand.
            (2) The Ozark National Scenic Riverways should be managed 
        primarily to preserve and protect the historical recreational 
        uses of the river, including canoeing, kayaking, floating, 
        horseback riding, camping, boating, fishing, trapping, hiking, 
        gigging, swimming, hunting, and other recreational activities 
        that have been performed within the park since its creation.

SEC. 2. ADMINISTRATION OF OZARK NATIONAL SCENIC RIVERWAYS.

    Public Law 88-492 (16 U.S.C. 460m et seq.) is amended as follows:
            (1) In section 1, by inserting ``preservation of historical 
        recreational activities,'' after ``caves,''.
            (2) In section 5, by adding at the end the following:
    ``(c) Zones.--Except as provided by subsection (b), the Secretary 
may not designate management zones in the Ozark National Scenic 
Riverways, including but not limited to `Developed', `Resource-based 
Recreation', `Natural', `Primitive', `Mixed-use River', `Seasonal 
Mixed-Use River', and `Nonmotorized River' zones.
    ``(d) Horseback Riding.--The Secretary shall manage the Ozark 
National Scenic Riverways in a manner that allows the public to engage 
in recreational horseback riding in areas of the park traditionally 
used for that purpose.
    ``(e) Access to the River.--The Secretary shall manage the Ozark 
National Scenic Riverways in a manner that--
            ``(1) allows maximum public access points to the riverways 
        within the park for traditional recreational activities such as 
        fishing, canoeing, kayaking, boating, swimming, gigging, and 
        floating;
            ``(2) does not require a permit for a river baptism;
            ``(3) does not include the Ozark National Scenic Riverways 
        as part of a `National Blueway,' or other similar program, as 
        described in Secretarial Order No. 3321 issued by the Secretary 
        of the Interior on May 24, 2012, with respect to the 
        establishment of a National Blueways System; and
            ``(4) does not manage lands within the Ozark National 
        Scenic Riverways as though they were specifically designated as 
        wilderness by Federal law absent such a designation.
    ``(f) Use of Motorized Vessels.--The Secretary--
            ``(1) shall manage the Ozark National Scenic Riverways to 
        allow the use of motorized vessels in a manner that is not more 
        restrictive than the use restrictions in effect on November 21, 
        2013; and
            ``(2) may manage the Ozark National Scenic Riverways to 
        allow the use of motorized vessels in a manner that is less 
        restrictive than the use restrictions in effect on November 21, 
        2013.
    ``(g) Congressional Wilderness Designation.--No area contained 
within the Ozark National Scenic Riverways shall be eligible for 
congressional wilderness designation under the Wilderness Act of 1964 
(Public Law 88-577).''.
            (3) By amending section 6 to read as follows:

``SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION.

    ``The Secretary--
            ``(1) shall manage the Ozark National Scenic Riverways in a 
        manner that is not more restrictive than the provisions of the 
        general management plan for the Ozark National Scenic Riverways 
        in effect on November 21, 2013, to the extent that those 
        provisions are consistent with the Act and other applicable 
        Federal law; and
            ``(2) may manage The Ozark National Scenic Riverways in a 
        manner that is less restrictive than the provisions of the 
        general management plan for the Ozark National Scenic Riverways 
        in effect on November 21, 2013, to the extent that those 
        provisions are consistent with the Act and other applicable 
        Federal law.''.
