                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 18, United States Code, to protect pain-capable unborn 
     children in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``District of Columbia Pain-Capable 
Unborn Child Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.

    Congress finds and declares the following:
            (1) Pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout the 
        unborn child's entire body and nerves link these receptors to 
        the brain's thalamus and subcortical plate by no later than 20 
        weeks after fertilization.
            (2) By 8 weeks after fertilization, the unborn child reacts 
        to touch. After 20 weeks, the unborn child reacts to stimuli 
        that would be recognized as painful if applied to an adult 
        human, for example, by recoiling.
            (3) In the unborn child, application of such painful 
        stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress 
        hormones known as the stress response.
            (4) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with 
        long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered 
        pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and 
        learning disabilities later in life.
            (5) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal 
        anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a 
        decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when 
        painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia.
            (6) The position, asserted by some medical experts, that 
        the unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a 
        point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization 
        predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to 
        experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires 
        nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex. However, 
        recent medical research and analysis, especially since 2007, 
        provides strong evidence for the conclusion that a functioning 
        cortex is not necessary to experience pain.
            (7) Substantial evidence indicates that children born 
        missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, those with 
        hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.
            (8) In adult humans and in animals, stimulation or ablation 
        of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while 
        stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.
            (9) Substantial evidence indicates that structures used for 
        pain processing in early development differ from those of 
        adults, using different neural elements available at specific 
        times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to 
        fulfill the role of pain processing.
            (10) The position, asserted by some commentators, that the 
        unborn child remains in a coma-like sleep state that precludes 
        the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent with the 
        documented reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and 
        with the experience of fetal surgeons who have found it 
        necessary to sedate the unborn child with anesthesia to prevent 
        the unborn child from engaging in vigorous movement in reaction 
        to invasive surgery.
            (11) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence 
        that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least 
        by 20 weeks after fertilization, if not earlier.
            (12) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert a 
        compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of 
        unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical 
        evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.
            (13) The compelling governmental interest in protecting the 
        lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial 
        medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling 
        pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the 
        compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of 
        unborn children from the stage of viability, and neither 
        governmental interest is intended to replace the other.
            (14) The District Council of the District of Columbia, 
        operating under authority delegated by Congress, repealed the 
        entire District law limiting abortions, effective April 29, 
        2004, so that in the District of Columbia, abortion is now 
        legal, for any reason, until the moment of birth.
            (15) Article I, section 8 of the Constitution of the United 
        States of America provides that the Congress shall ``exercise 
        exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever'' over the 
        District established as the seat of government of the United 
        States, now known as the District of Columbia. The 
        constitutional responsibility for the protection of pain-
        capable unborn children within the Federal District resides 
        with the Congress.

SEC. 3. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 74 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by inserting after section 1531 the following:
``Sec. 1532. District of Columbia pain-capable unborn child protection
    ``(a) Unlawful Conduct.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, including any legislation of the District of Columbia under 
authority delegated by Congress, it shall be unlawful for any person to 
perform an abortion within the District of Columbia, or attempt to do 
so, unless in conformity with the requirements set forth in subsection 
(b).
    ``(b) Requirements for Abortions.--
            ``(1) The physician performing or attempting the abortion 
        shall first make a determination of the probable post-
        fertilization age of the unborn child or reasonably rely upon 
        such a determination made by another physician. In making such 
        a determination, the physician shall make such inquiries of the 
        pregnant woman and perform or cause to be performed such 
        medical examinations and tests as a reasonably prudent 
        physician, knowledgeable about the case and the medical 
        conditions involved, would consider necessary to make an 
        accurate determination of post-fertilization age.
            ``(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the 
        abortion shall not be performed or attempted, if the probable 
        post-fertilization age, as determined under paragraph (1), of 
        the unborn child is 20 weeks or greater.
            ``(B) Subject to subparagraph (C), subparagraph (A) does 
        not apply if, in reasonable medical judgment, the abortion is 
        necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman whose life is 
        endangered by a physical disorder, physical illness, or 
        physical injury, including a life-endangering physical 
        condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, but 
        not including psychological or emotional conditions.
            ``(C) Notwithstanding the definitions of `abortion' and 
        `attempt an abortion' in this section, a physician terminating 
        or attempting to terminate a pregnancy under the exception 
        provided by subparagraph (B) may do so only in the manner 
        which, in reasonable medical judgment, provides the best 
        opportunity for the unborn child to survive, unless, in 
        reasonable medical judgment, termination of the pregnancy in 
        that manner would pose a greater risk of--
                    ``(i) the death of the pregnant woman; or
                    ``(ii) the substantial and irreversible physical 
                impairment of a major bodily function, not including 
                psychological or emotional conditions, of the pregnant 
                woman;
        than would other available methods.
    ``(c) Criminal Penalty.--Whoever violates subsection (a) shall be 
fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than 2 years, or 
both.
    ``(d) Bar to Prosecution.--A woman upon whom an abortion in 
violation of subsection (a) is performed or attempted may not be 
prosecuted under, or for a conspiracy to violate, subsection (a), or 
for an offense under section 2, 3, or 4 based on such a violation.
    ``(e) Civil Remedies.--
            ``(1) Civil action by woman on whom the abortion is 
        performed.--A woman upon whom an abortion has been performed or 
        attempted in violation of subsection (a), may in a civil action 
        against any person who engaged in the violation obtain 
        appropriate relief.
            ``(2) Civil action by relatives.--The father of an unborn 
        child who is the subject of an abortion performed or attempted 
        in violation of subsection (a), or a maternal grandparent of 
        the unborn child if the pregnant woman is an unemancipated 
        minor, may in a civil action against any person who engaged in 
        the violation, obtain appropriate relief, unless the pregnancy 
        resulted from the plaintiff's criminal conduct or the plaintiff 
        consented to the abortion.
            ``(3) Appropriate relief.--Appropriate relief in a civil 
        action under this subsection includes--
                    ``(A) objectively verifiable money damages for all 
                injuries, psychological and physical, occasioned by the 
                violation of this section;

        a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs to a 
        prevailing plaintiff in a civil action under this subsection.
            ``(6) Attorneys fees for defendant.--If a defendant in a 
        civil action under this section prevails and the court finds 
        that the plaintiff's suit was frivolous and brought in bad 
        faith, the court shall also render judgment for a reasonable 
        attorney's fee in favor of the defendant against the plaintiff.
            ``(7) Awards against woman.--Except under paragraph (6), in 
        a civil action under this subsection, no damages, attorney's 
        fee or other monetary relief may be assessed against the woman

    ``(f) Protection of Privacy in Court Proceedings.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except to the extent the Constitution or 
        other similarly compelling reason requires, in every civil or 
        criminal action under this section, the court shall make such 
        orders as are necessary to protect the anonymity of any woman 
        upon whom an abortion has been performed or attempted if she 
        does not give her written consent to such disclosure. Such 
        orders may be made upon motion, but shall be made sua sponte if 
        not otherwise sought by a party.
            ``(2) Orders to parties, witnesses, and counsel.--The court

        hearing rooms to the extent necessary to safeguard her identity 
        from public disclosure. Each such order shall be accompanied by 
        specific written findings explaining why the anonymity of the 
        woman must be preserved from public disclosure, why the order 
        is essential to that end, how the order is narrowly tailored to 
        serve that interest, and why no reasonable less restrictive 
        alternative exists.
            ``(3) Pseudonym required.--In the absence of written
