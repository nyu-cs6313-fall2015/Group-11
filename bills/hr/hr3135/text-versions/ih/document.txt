    (a) In General.--Chapter 21 is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
``Sec. 2110. Domestic partnerships
    ``(a) Establishment.--To establish the existence of a domestic 
partnership, between an employee, former employee, or annuitant and 
another individual, for purposes of the provisions of law to which this 
section applies, the employee, former employee, or annuitant (as the 
case may be) shall be required to file an affidavit, in such form and 
manner as the Office of Personnel Management shall by regulation 
prescribe, attesting to the following:
            ``(1) Both individuals are members of the same sex.
            ``(2) Both individuals are at least 18 years of age and 
        competent to contract.
            ``(3) The filing employee, former employee, or annuitant 
        (as the case may be) has notified the other individual of the 
        filing of the affidavit attesting that their partnership 
        satisfies the requirements of this subsection.
            ``(4) Such individuals are in a domestic partnership with 
        one another and intend to remain so indefinitely.
            ``(5) Such individuals--
                    ``(A) have a common residence; or
                    ``(B) do not have a common residence because of 
                financial, employment-related, or other reasons, as 
                identified in the affidavit.
            ``(6) Neither individual is married to or in a domestic 
        partnership with anyone outside of the domestic partnership 
        referred to in paragraph (4).
            ``(7) The 2 individuals share responsibility for a 
        significant measure of each other's common welfare and 
        financial obligations.
            ``(8) The 2 individuals are not related in a way that, if 
        they were of the opposite sex, would prohibit legal marriage in 
        any jurisdiction in which the individuals have a common 
        residence.
            ``(9) Neither individual resides in a covered State.
            ``(10) The filing employee, former employee, or annuitant 
        (as the case may be) understands that willful falsification of 
        information set forth in the affidavit or failure to provide 
        appropriate notification of the termination of the domestic 
        partnership may lead to the recovery of amounts obtained as a 
        result of such falsification or failure (as the case may be), 
        criminal or other penalties, and (in appropriate cases) 
        disciplinary action.
An affidavit shall not be effective for purposes of establishing the 
existence of a domestic partnership under this section unless the 
filing individual is an employee, former employee, or annuitant as of 
the time of filing. No two individuals shall, for purposes of the 
provisions of law to which this section applies, be treated as being in 
a domestic partnership with one another unless there is in effect, in 
accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office, an affidavit 
filed in accordance with the preceding provisions of this subsection.
    ``(b) Termination.--
            ``(1) In general.--A domestic partnership established under 
        subsection (a) terminates--
                    ``(A) upon the death of either domestic partner;
                    ``(B) if the condition set forth in subsection 
                (a)(9) has ceased to exist for a period of 6 months; or
                    ``(C) upon the occurrence of such other terminating 
                event or condition as the Director may by regulation 
                prescribe.
            ``(2) Notification.--

                terminates, either or both of the domestic partners

                partnership terminates, execute and file a 
                notification, in such form and in such manner the

survivor annuity for the current spouse (or the current domestic 
partner) of a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each 
full month--

        (or the termination of the domestic partnership of the domestic 
        partner) to the employee or Member,
except that an appropriate reduction shall be made thereafter if the 
spouse (or domestic partner) is entitled, as a former spouse (or former 
domestic partner), to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h).
    ``(B) Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a 
survivor annuity for a former spouse (or a former domestic partner) of 
a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each full month 
after the former spouse remarries (or the former domestic partner 
enters into a subsequent domestic partnership) before reaching age 55 
or dies. This reduction shall be replaced by an appropriate reduction 
or reductions under paragraph (4) if the retired employee or Member has 
(i) another former spouse (or another former domestic partner) who is 
entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h), (ii) a current 
spouse to whom the employee or Member was married (or a current 
domestic partner with whom the employee or Member was in a domestic 
partnership) at the time of retirement and with respect to whom a 
survivor annuity was not jointly waived under paragraph (1), or (iii) a 
current spouse whom the employee or Member married (or a current 
domestic partner with whom the employee or Member entered into domestic 
partnership) after retirement and with respect to whom an election has 
been made under subparagraph (C) or subsection (k)(2).
    ``(C)(i) Upon remarriage (or entry into a subsequent domestic 
partnership), a retired employee or Member who was married (or in a 
domestic partnership) at the time of retirement, including an employee 
or Member whose annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity 
for the employee's or Member's spouse or former spouse (or domestic 
partner or former domestic partner) as of the time of retirement, may 
irrevocably elect during such marriage (or domestic partnership), in a 
signed writing received by the Office--
            ``(I) within 2 years after such remarriage (or such 
        subsequent domestic partnership), or
            ``(II) if later, within 2 years after--

                partnership by the last such surviving former domestic 
                partner),

for the purpose of providing an annuity for such employee's or Member's 
spouse (or domestic partner) in the event such spouse (or domestic 
partner) survives the employee or Member.
    ``(ii) Such election and reduction shall be effective the first day 
of the second month after the election is received by the Office, but 
not less than 9 months after the date of the remarriage (or entry into 
the subsequent domestic partnership), and the retired employee or 
Member shall deposit in the Fund an amount determined by the Office of 
Personnel Management, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to 
reflect the amount by which the annuity of such retired employee or 
Member would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since 
the date of retirement or, if later, the date the previous reduction in 
such retired employee's or Member's annuity was terminated under 
subparagraph (A) or (B), plus interest. For the purposes of the 
preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during 
which an annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in 
effect on and after the applicable date referred to in such sentence 
shall be 6 percent.
    ``(iii) The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the 
deposit required under clause (ii) by a reduction in the annuity of the 
employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be 
designed so that the present value of the future reduction is 
actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under clause (ii), 
except that total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to 
pay deposits required by the provisions of this paragraph or paragraph 
(3) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under 
subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments 
under section 8340. The reduction required by this clause, which shall 
be effective on the same date as the election under clause (i), shall 
be permanent and unaffected by any future dissolution of the marriage 
(or termination of the domestic partnership). Such reduction shall be 
independent of and in addition to the reduction required under clause 
(i).
    ``(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph, an 
election under this subparagraph may not be made for the purpose of 
providing an annuity in the case of a spouse by remarriage (or a 
domestic partner by a subsequent domestic partnership) if such spouse 
was married to (or if such domestic partner was in a domestic 
partnership with) the employee or Member at the time of such employee's 
or Member's retirement, and all rights to survivor benefits for such 
spouse (or domestic partner) under this subchapter based on marriage 
(or domestic partnership) to such employee or Member were then waived 
under paragraph (1) or a similar prior provision of law.
    ``(v) An election to provide a survivor annuity to a person under 
this subparagraph--
