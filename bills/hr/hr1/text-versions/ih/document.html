                        subparagraph:
                    ``(D) Indian reservation.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, the term `Indian reservation' means a 
                reservation, as defined in--
                            ``(i) section 3(d) of the Indian Financing 
                        Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1452(d)), or

                3(d) shall be applied by treating the term `former 
                Indian reservations in Oklahoma' as including only 
                lands which are within the jurisdictional area of an 
                Oklahoma Indian tribe (as determined by the Secretary 
                of the Interior) and are recognized by such Secretary 
                as eligible for trust land status under 25 CFR Part 151 
                (as in effect on August 5, 1997).''.
    (g) Normalization Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--A normalization method of accounting shall 
        not be treated as being used with respect to any public utility 
        property for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986 if the taxpayer, in computing its cost of 
        service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating 
        results in its regulated books of account, reduces the excess 
        tax reserve more rapidly or to a greater extent than such 
        reserve would be reduced under the average rate assumption 
        method.
            (2) Alternative method for certain taxpayers.--If, as of 
        the first day of the taxable year that includes the date of 
        enactment of this Act--
                    (A) the taxpayer was required by a regulatory 
                agency to compute depreciation for public utility 
                property on the basis of an average life or composite 
                rate method, and
                    (B) the taxpayer's books and underlying records did 
                not contain the vintage account data necessary to apply 
                the average rate assumption method,
        the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method of 
        accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer 
        uses the alternative method for public utility property that is 
        subject to the regulatory authority of that jurisdiction.
            (3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--
                    (A) Excess tax reserve.--The term ``excess tax 
                reserve'' means the excess of--
                            (i) the reserve for deferred taxes (as 
                        described in section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the 
                        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as in effect on 
                        the day before the date of the enactment of 
                        this Act), over
                            (ii) the amount which would be the balance 
                        in such reserve if the amount of such reserve 
                        were determined by assuming that the corporate 
                        rate reductions provided in this Act were in 
                        effect for all prior periods.
                    (B) Average rate assumption method.--The average 
                rate assumption method is the method under which the 
                excess in the reserve for deferred taxes is reduced 
                over the remaining lives of the property as used in its 
                regulated books of account which gave rise to the 
                reserve for deferred taxes. Under such method, if 
                timing differences for the property reverse, the amount 
                of the adjustment to the reserve for the deferred taxes 
                is calculated by multiplying--
                            (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred 
                        taxes for the property to the aggregate timing 
                        differences for the property as of the 
                        beginning of the period in question, by
                            (ii) the amount of the timing differences 
                        which reverse during such period.
                    (C) Alternative method.--The ``alternative method'' 
                is the method in which the taxpayer--
                            (i) computes the excess tax reserve on all 
                        public utility property included in the plant 
                        account on the basis of the weighted average 
                        life or composite rate used to compute 
                        depreciation for regulatory purposes, and
                            (ii) reduces the excess tax reserve ratably 
                        over the remaining regulatory life of the 
                        property.
            (4) Tax increased for normalization violation.--If, for any 
        taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of 
        accounting, the taxpayer's tax for the taxable year shall be 
        increased by the amount by which it reduces its excess tax 
        reserve more rapidly than permitted under a normalization 
        method of accounting.
    (h) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2016.

of any money received by the taxpayer and increased in the amount of

the date of the exchange. For purposes of this section and section 
1036(a), where as part of the consideration to the taxpayer another 
party to the exchange assumed (as determined under section 357(d)) a

    (a) In General.--Section 734 is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 734. ADJUSTMENT TO BASIS OF UNDISTRIBUTED PARTNERSHIP PROPERTY.

    ``(a) In General.--In the case of any distribution to a partner, 
the partnership shall adjust the basis of partnership property such 
that each remaining partner's net liquidation amount immediately after 
such distribution is equal to such partner's net liquidation amount 
immediately before such distribution.
    ``(b) Distributions Other Than in Liquidation of a Partner's 
Interest.--In the case of any distribution to a partner other than in 
liquidation of such partner's interest, proper adjustment shall be made 
under subsection (a) with respect to such partner to take into 
account--
            ``(1) the amount of any gain recognized by such partner 
        with respect to such distribution under section 731(a), and
            ``(2) the amount of any gain or loss which would be 
        recognized by such partner if such partner sold the property 
        distributed at fair market value immediately after such 
        distribution.
    ``(c) Net Liquidation Amount.--For purposes of this section, the 
term `net liquidation amount' means, with respect to any partner, the 
net amount of gain or loss (if any) which would be taken into account 
by the partner under section 702 if the partnership sold all of its 
assets at fair market value (and no other amounts were taken into 
account under such section).
    ``(d) Allocation of Basis.--
            ``(1) Decreases in basis.--Any decrease in the adjusted 
        basis of partnership property which is required under this 
        section--

                751(d)) to the extent thereof.
        If any such decrease is prevented by the absence of sufficient 
        adjusted basis of partnership property, each partner shall 
        recognize gain in the amount of such partner's distributive 
        share of such prevented decrease. Such gain shall be treated as 
        gain from the sale of the partner's partnership interest.

                751(d)).
        If any such increase is prevented by the absence of property 
        described in subparagraph (B), each partners shall recognize a 
        loss in the amount of such partner's distributive share of such 
        prevented increase. Such loss shall be treated as a loss from 
        the sale of the partner's partnership interest.

Partner.--In making an allocation under subsection (d) of any decrease 
in the adjusted basis of partnership property required under subsection 
(a)--
            ``(1) no allocation may be made to stock in a corporation 
        (or any person related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 
        707(b)(1)) to such corporation) which is a partner in the 
        partnership, and
            ``(2) any amount not allocable to stock by reason of 
        paragraph (1) shall be allocated under subsection (d) to other 
        partnership property.

subsection (e)(2) exceeds the aggregate adjusted basis of such other 
property immediately before the allocation required by subsection 
(a).''.

        is filed, the amount of the imputed underpayment (as of the 
        date of the filing of the petition) if the partnership

items among the partners, and the applicability of any penalty, 
addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership may be 
liable under this subchapter.

The date of any such determination shall be treated as being the date 
of the court's order entering the decision.

under this section is dismissed other than by reason of a rescission 
under section 6231(c), the decision of the court dismissing the action 
shall be considered as its decision that the notice of final 
partnership adjustment is correct, and an appropriate order shall be 
entered in the records of the court.

        deferred compensation arrangements for its service providers
