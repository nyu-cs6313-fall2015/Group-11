Requires the grants to be awarded in four-school-year increments.\n\nRequires the grants to be used to:\n\n acquaint female students with, and prepare them to pursue, STEM careers; educate the parents of such students about the opportunities and advantages of STEM careers; provide female students with STEM tutoring, mentoring, after-school activities, and summer programs; expose female students to STEM role models, events, academic programs, or career and technical education programs; purchase education materials, equipment, or software that facilitate STEM instruction; assist female students in selecting secondary school courses that provide them with preparation for postsecondary education and experiential learning opportunities in STEM; facilitate STEM internships for such students; and provide teachers with training that enables them to more effectively teach STEM and overcome gender biases that discourage female students' advancement in those fields."
