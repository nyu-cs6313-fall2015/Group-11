                                 A BILL


 
  To require notification when personally identifying information is 
       disclosed by a Government agency, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Personal Information Notification 
Act''.

SEC. 2. NOTIFICATION OF DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BY AGENCIES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that when personally identifying 
information is obtained through an agency by an entity outside of the 
Government without the knowledge of the individual it pertains to, it 
may constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and such 
individual should be notified that the information was accessed in 
order to be afforded the opportunity to respond.
    (b) OMB Policies and Procedures.--Not later than the first October 
1 after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget shall establish and oversee policies 
and procedures that require an agency to send a written notification to 
any individual whose personally identifying information is accessed by 
a private entity, not later than 30 calendar days after the information 
was accessed. Such letter shall identify the information accessed and 
the name of the entity who accessed the information.
    (c) Contact Information.--The Director of the Office of Management 
and Budget--
            (1) may obtain the contact information used to notify an 
        individual by letter described in subsection (b) from sources 
        including a driver's license and voter registration; and
            (2) may not obtain such contact information from the 
        Internal Revenue Service or the National Security Agency.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given that 
        term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.
            (2) Personally identifying information.--The term 
        ``personally identifying information'' means any information 
        about an individual maintained by an agency that is not already 
        public information, including, without limitation, education, 
        financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or 
        employment history, and information that can be used to 
        distinguish or trace the identity of an individual, such as a 
        social security number, date and place of birth, mother's 
        maiden name, and biometric records.
