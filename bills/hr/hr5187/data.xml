Catalyst Theory Restoration Act of 2014 - Defines "prevailing party" for any Act of Congress, any agency ruling, regulation, or interpretation, or any judicial or administrative rule that provides for the recovery of attorney's fees, to include a party whose pursuit of a non-frivolous claim or defense was a catalyst for a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the opposing party that provides any significant part of the relief sought.

Prohibits this Act from altering any: (1) special eligibility criteria established for prevailing defendants, or (2) specific eligibility criteria contained in any statute that expressly limits or qualifies who may be considered a prevailing party for purposes of that statute.</summary>
