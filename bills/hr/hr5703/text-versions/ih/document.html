                                 A BILL


 
  To protect and preserve international cultural property at risk of 
destruction due to political instability, armed conflict, or natural or 
                other disasters, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect and Preserve International 
Cultural Property Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITION.

    In this Act:
            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term 
        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.
            (2) Cultural property.--The term ``cultural property'' has 
        the meaning given in Article 1(a)-1(c) of the Hague Convention 
        for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed 
        Conflict, concluded at The Hague on May 14, 1954 (Treaty Doc. 
        106-1(A)).

SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Protecting international cultural property is a vital 
        part of United States cultural diplomacy, showing the respect 
        of the United States for other cultures and the common heritage 
        of humanity.
            (2) International cultural property has been lost, damaged, 
        or destroyed due to political instability, armed conflict, 
        natural disasters, and other threats.
            (3) In Egypt, recent political instability has led to the 
        ransacking of its museums, resulting in the destruction of 
        countless ancient artifacts that will forever leave gaps in 
        humanity's record of the ancient Egyptian civilization.
            (4) In Iraq, after the fall of Saddam Hussein, thieves 
        looted the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, resulting in the loss of 
        approximately 15,000 items. These included ancient amulets, 
        sculptures, ivories, and cylinder seals. Many of these items 
        remain unrecovered.
            (5) In Syria, the ongoing civil war has resulted in the 
        shelling of medieval cities, damage to five UNESCO World 
        Heritage Sites, and the looting of museums and archaeological 
        sites. Archaeological and historic sites and artifacts in Syria 
        date back more than six millennia and include some of the 
        earliest examples of writing.
            (6) In Iraq and Syria, the militant group ISIS/ISIL has 
        destroyed cultural sites and artifacts, such as the Tomb of 
        Jonah in July 2014, in an effort to eradicate ethnic and 
        religious minorities from contested territories. Concurrently, 
        cultural antiquities that escape demolition are looted and 
        illicitly trafficked to help fund ISIS/ISIL's militant 
        operations.
            (7) In Mali, the Al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist group Ansar 
        Dine destroyed tombs and shrines in the ancient city of 
        Timbuktu--a major center for trade, scholarship, and Islam in 
        the 15th and 16th centuries--and threatened collections of 
        ancient manuscripts.
            (8) In Afghanistan, the Taliban decreed that the Bamiyan 
        Buddhas, ancient statues carved into a cliff side in central 
        Afghanistan, were to be destroyed. In 2001 the Taliban carried 
        out their threat and destroyed the statues, leading to 
        worldwide condemnation.
            (9) In Cambodia, following the Khmer Rouge's seizure of 
        power in 1975 the Khmer Rouge systematically destroyed many of 
        Cambodia's Buddhist temples, desecrated statues, and destroyed 
        Buddhist literature. The Khmer Rouge also destroyed mosques and 
        nearly every Catholic church existing in the country.
            (10) In China, during the Cultural Revolution much of 
        China's antiques were destroyed, including a large portion of 
        old Beijing. Chinese authorities are now attempting to rebuild 
        portions of China's lost architectural heritage.
            (11) In Haiti, the 2010 earthquake destroyed art, 
        artifacts, and archives important to the people of Haiti, and 
        partially destroyed the 17th century Haitian city of Jacmel.
            (12) The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami not only 
        affected eleven countries, causing massive loss of life, but 
        also damaged or destroyed libraries, archives, and UNESCO World 
        Heritage Sites such as the Mahabalipuram in India, the Sun 
        Temple of Koranak on the Bay of Bengal, and the Old Town of 
        Galle and its Fortifications in Sri Lanka.
            (13) The destruction of these and other cultural properties 
        represents an irreparable loss of humanity's common cultural 
        heritage and is therefore a loss for all Americans.
            (14) The United States Armed Forces have played important 
        roles in preserving and protecting cultural property. On June 
        23, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the 
        American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic 
        and Historic Monuments in War Areas to provide expert advice to 
        the military on the protection of cultural property. The 
        Commission formed Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) 
        teams which became part of the Civil Affairs Division of 
        Military Government Section of the Allied armies. The 
        individuals serving in the MFAA were known as the ``Monuments 
        Men'' and have been credited with securing, cataloguing, and 
        returning hundreds of thousands works of art stolen by the 
        Nazis during World War II.
            (15) The U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield was founded in 
        2006 to support the implementation of the 1954 Hague Convention 
        for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed 
        Conflict and to coordinate with the United States military, 
        other branches of the United States Government, and other 
        cultural heritage nongovernmental organizations in preserving 
        international cultural property threatened by political 
        instability, armed conflict, natural, or other disasters.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to--
            (1) protect and preserve international cultural property at 
        risk of destruction due to political instability, armed 
        conflict, or natural or other disasters;
            (2) protect international cultural property pursuant to its 
        obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection 
        of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and 
        customary international law in all conflicts to which the 
        United States is a party;
            (3) prevent, in accordance with existing laws, importation 
        of cultural property pillaged, looted, or stolen during 
        political instability, armed conflict, or natural or other 
        disasters; and
            (4) ensure that existing laws and regulations, including 
        import restrictions imposed through the Office of Foreign Asset 
        Control (OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury, are fully 
        implemented to prevent the trafficking in stolen or looted 
        cultural property.
