Prohibits the Secretary, however, as part of a CMMI demonstration, from waiving: (1) the requirement to offer items and services under Medicare without limitations, and (2) certain requirements regarding enrollment in and disenrollment from PACE programs.\n\nExpresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the Secretary should use waiver authority under this Act to provide, in a budget neutral manner, PACE programs with increased operational flexibility to support their ability to improve and innovate and to reduce technical and administrative barriers that have hindered enrollment."
