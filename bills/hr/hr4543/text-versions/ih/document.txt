   authority to PACE programs in order to foster innovations in such

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. APPLYING CMMI WAIVER AUTHORITY TO FOSTER INNOVATIONS IN PACE 
              PROGRAMS.

    (a) In General.--Section 1115A(d)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1315a(d)(1)) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(other than subsections (b)(1)(A) and 
        (c)(5) of section 1894)'' after ``XVIII''; and
            (2) by striking ``and 1903(m)(2)(A)(iii)'' and inserting 
        ``1903(m)(2)(A)(iii), and 1934 (other than subsections

    (b) Sense of the House of Representatives.--It is the sense of the

made by this section to provide, in a budget neutral manner, programs 
of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE programs) with increased 
operational flexibility to support the ability of such programs to 
improve and innovate and to reduce technical and administrative 
barriers that have hindered enrollment in such programs.
