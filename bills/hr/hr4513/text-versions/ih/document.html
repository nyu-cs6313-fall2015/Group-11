    Section 140 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1650) is amended 
by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(g) Prohibition on Accelerating Repayment Upon Death or 
Disability of a Cosigner on a Private Education Loan.--
            ``(1) In general.--If a cosigner who is jointly liable on a 
        private education loan is unable to fulfill any obligations 
        with respect to the loan by reason of death or disability, the 
        private educational lender may not accelerate the repayment 
        terms of any outstanding obligation if the borrower is in good 
        standing (as determined by the Bureau) with respect to the 
        loan.
            ``(2) Disability defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        `disability' means a permanent and total disability, as 
        determined in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary 
        of Education under section 437(a) of the Higher Education Act 
        of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087(a)), or a determination by the 
        Secretary of Veterans Affairs that the individual is 
        unemployable due to a service-connected condition.''.
