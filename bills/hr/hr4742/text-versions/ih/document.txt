amended--
            (1) in paragraph (4)--
                    (A) in subparagraph (A)(i), by striking 
                ``possible'' and inserting ``practicable'';

                        would be rebuilt without fishing occurring plus 
                        one mean generation, except in a case in 
                        which--

                                the Council or the rebuilding program

                                rebuilt within that time- frame without 
                                significant economic harm to the

                                causing another component of the mixed-
                                stock fishery to approach a depleted 
                                status;

                                exclusive economic zone by another 
                                country may hinder conservation and

                end of subparagraph (B), by redesignating subparagraphs 
                (B) and (C) as subparagraphs (C) and (D), and by

                toward reaching rebuilding targets.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) A fishery management plan, plan amendment, or 
        proposed regulations may use alternative rebuilding strategies, 
        including harvest control rules and fishing mortality-rate 
        targets to the extent they are in compliance with the 
        requirements of this Act.
            ``(9) A Council may terminate the application of paragraph 
        (3) to a fishery if the Council's scientific and statistical 
        committee determines and the Secretary concurs that the 
        original determination that the fishery was depleted was 
        erroneous, either--

SEC. 104. MODIFICATIONS TO THE ANNUAL CATCH LIMIT REQUIREMENT.

    Section 302 (16 U.S.C. 1852) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
    ``(m) Considerations for Modifications to Annual Catch Limit 
Requirements.--
            ``(1) Consideration of ecosystem and economic impacts.--In 
        establishing annual catch limits a Council may, consistent with 
        section 302(h)(6), consider changes in an ecosystem and the 
        economic needs of the fishing communities.
            ``(2) Limitations to annual catch limit requirement for 
        special fisheries.--Notwithstanding subsection (h)(6), a 
        Council is not required to develop an annual catch limit for--
                    ``(A) an ecosystem component species;
                    ``(B) a fishery for a species that has a life cycle 
                of approximately 1 year, unless the Secretary has 
                determined the fishery is subject to overfishing; or
                    ``(C) a stock for which--
                            ``(i) more than half of a single-year class 
                        will complete their life cycle in less than 18 
                        months; and
                            ``(ii) fishing mortality will have little 
                        impact on the stock.
            ``(3) Relationship to international fishery efforts.--Each 
        annual catch limit may, consistent with section 302(h)(6), take 
        into account--
                    ``(A) management measures under international 
                agreements in which the United States participates; and
                    ``(B) informal transboundary agreements under which 
                fishery management activities by another country 
                outside the exclusive economic zone may hinder 
                conservation efforts by United States fishermen for a 
                fish species for which any of the recruitment, 
                distribution, life history, or fishing activities are 
                transboundary.
            ``(4) Authorization for multispecies complexes and 
        multiyear annual catch limits.--For purposes of subsection 
        (h)(6), a Council may establish--
                    ``(A) an annual catch limit for a stock complex; or
                    ``(B) annual catch limits for each year in any 
                continuous period that is not more than three years in 
                duration.
            ``(5) Ecosystem component species defined.--In this 
        subsection the term `ecosystem component species' means a stock 
        of fish that is a nontarget, incidentally harvested stock of 
        fish in a fishery, or a nontarget, incidentally harvested stock 
        of fish that a Council or the Secretary has determined--
                    ``(A) is not subject to overfishing, approaching a 
                depleted condition or depleted; and
                    ``(B) is not likely to become subject to 
                overfishing or depleted in the absence of conservation 
                and management measures.''.

SEC. 105. DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN OVERFISHED AND DEPLETED.

    (a) Definitions.--Section 3 (16 U.S.C. 1802) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (34), by striking ``and `overfished' 
        mean'' and inserting ``means''; and
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following:
            ``(8a) The term `depleted' means, with respect to a stock 
        of fish or stock complex, that the stock or stock complex has a 
        biomass that has declined below a level that jeopardizes the 
        capacity of the stock or stock complex to produce maximum 
        sustainable yield on a continuing basis.''.
    (b) Substitution of Term.--The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) is amended by 
striking ``overfished'' each place it appears and inserting 
``depleted''.
    (c) Clarity in Annual Report.--Section 304(e)(1) (16 U.S.C. 
1854(e)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The report 
shall distinguish between fisheries that are depleted (or approaching 
that condition) as a result of fishing and fisheries that are depleted 
(or approaching that condition) as a result of factors other than 
fishing. The report shall state, for each fishery identified as 
depleted or approaching that condition, whether the fishery is the 
target of directed fishing.''.

SEC. 106. TRANSPARENCY AND PUBLIC PROCESS.

    (a) Advice.--Section 302(g)(1)(B) (16 U.S.C. 1852(g)(1)(B)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following: ``Each scientific and 
statistical committee shall develop such advice in a transparent manner 
and allow for public involvement in the process.''.
    (b) Meetings.--Section 302(i)(2) (16 U.S.C. 1852(i)(2)) is amended 
by adding at the end the following:
            ``(G) Each Council shall make available on the Internet Web 
        site of the Council--
                    ``(i) to the extent practicable, a Webcast, an 
                audio recording, or a live broadcast of each meeting of 
                the Council, and of the Council Coordination Committee 
                established under subsection (l), that is not closed in 
                accordance with paragraph (3); and
                    ``(ii) audio, video (if the meeting was in person 
                or by video conference), or a searchable audio or 
                written transcript of each meeting of the Council and 
                of the meetings of committees referred to in section 
                302(g)(1)(B) of the Council by not later than 30 days 
                after the conclusion of the meeting.
            ``(H) The Secretary shall maintain and make available to 
        the public an archive of Council and scientific and statistical 
        committee meeting audios, videos, and transcripts made 
        available under clauses (i) and (ii) subparagraph (G).''.
    (c) Fishery Impact Statements.--
            (1) Requirement.--Section 303 (16 U.S.C. 1853) is amended--
                    (A) in subsection (a), by striking paragraph (9) 
                and redesignating paragraphs (10) through (15) as 
                paragraphs (9) through (14), respectively; and

        plan amendment) prepared by any Council or by the Secretary

     TITLE II--REVITALIZING THE ECONOMY OF FISHERIES IN THE PACIFIC

SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Revitalizing the Economy of 
Fisheries in the Pacific Act'' or the ``REFI Pacific Act''.

SEC. 202. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 2000, the Secretary of Commerce declared the West 
        Coast groundfish fishery a Federal fisheries economic disaster 
        due to low stock abundance, an overcapitalized fleet, and 
        historically overfished stocks.
            (2) Section 212 of the Department of Commerce and Related 
        Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003 (title II of division B of 
        Public Law 108-7; 117 Stat. 80) was enacted to establish a 
        Pacific Coast groundfish fishing capacity reduction program, 
        also known as a buyback program, to remove excess fishing 
        capacity.
            (3) In 2003, Congress authorized the $35,700,000 buyback 
        loan, creating the Pacific Coast groundfish fishing capacity 
        reduction program through the National Marine Fisheries Service 
        fisheries finance program with a term of 30 years. The interest 
        rate of the buyback loan was fixed at 6.97 percent and is paid 
        back based on an ex-vessel fee landing rate not to exceed 5 
        percent for the loan.
            (4) The groundfish fishing capacity reduction program 
        resulted in the removal of limited entry trawl Federal fishing 
        permits from the fishery, representing approximately 46 percent 
        of total landings at the time.
            (5) Because of an absence of a repayment mechanism, 
        $4,243,730 in interest accrued before fee collection procedures 
        were established in 2005, over 18 months after the groundfish 
        fishing capacity reduction program was initiated.
            (6) In 2011, the West Coast groundfish fishery transitioned 
        to an individual fishing quota fishery, which is a type of 
        catch share program.
            (7) By 2015, West Coast groundfish fishermen's expenses are 
        expected to include fees of approximately $450 per day for 
        observers, a 3-percent cost recovery fee as authorized by the 
        Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 
        U.S.C. 1801) for catch share programs, and a 5-percent ex-
        vessel landings rate for the loan repayment, which could reach 
        18 percent of their total gross revenue.
            (8) In 2012, the West Coast groundfish limited entry trawl 
        fishery generated $63,000,000, an increase from an average of 
        $45,000,000 during the years 2006 to 2011. This revenue is 
        expected to continue to increase post-rationalization.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to refinance the Pacific 
Coast groundfish fishery fishing capacity reduction program to protect 
and conserve the West Coast groundfish fishery and the coastal 
economies in California, Oregon, and Washington that rely on it.

SEC. 203. REFINANCING OF PACIFIC COAST GROUNDFISH FISHING CAPACITY 
              REDUCTION LOAN.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce, upon receipt of such 
assurances as the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the 
interests of the United States, shall issue a loan to refinance the 
existing debt obligation funding the fishing capacity reduction program

the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 
2003 (title II of division B of Public Law 108-7; 117 Stat. 80).
    (b) Applicable Law.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, 
the Secretary shall issue the loan under this section in accordance 
with subsections (b) through (e) of section 312 of the Magnuson-Stevens

        beginning on the date of issuance of the loan.
            (2) Extension.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1) and if there 
        is an outstanding balance on the loan after the period 
        described in paragraph (1), a loan under this section shall 
        have a maturity of 45 years or until the loan is repaid in 
        full.
    (d) Limitation on Fee Amount.--Notwithstanding section 312(d)(2)(B) 
of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 
U.S.C. 1861a(d)(2)(B)), the fee established by the Secretary with 
respect to a loan under this section shall not exceed 3 percent of the 
ex-vessel value of the harvest from each fishery for where the loan is 
issued.
    (e) Interest Rate.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 53702(b)(2) of 
        title 46, United States Code, the annual rate of interest an 
        obligor shall pay on a direct loan obligation under this 
        section is the percent the Secretary must pay as interest to 
        borrow from the Treasury the funds to make the loan.
            (2) Subloans.--Each subloan under the loan authorized by 
        this section--
                    (A) shall receive the interest rate described in 
                paragraph (1); and
                    (B) may be paid off at any time notwithstanding 
                subsection (c)(1).
    (f) Ex-Vessel Landing Fee.--
            (1) Calculations and accuracy.--The Secretary shall set the 
        ex-vessel landing fee to be collected for payment of the loan 
        under this section--
                    (A) as low as possible, based on recent landings 
                value in the fishery, to meet the requirements of loan 
                repayment;
                    (B) upon issuance of the loan in accordance with 
                paragraph (2); and
                    (C) on a regular interval not to exceed every 5 
                years beginning on the date of issuance of the loan.
            (2) Deadline for initial ex-vessel landings fee 
        calculation.--Not later than 60 days after the date of issuance 
        of the loan under this section, the Secretary shall recalculate 
        the ex-vessel landing fee based on the most recent value of the 
        fishery.
    (g) Authorization.--There is authorized to be appropriated to the 
Secretary of Commerce to carry out this section an amount equal to 1 
percent of the amount of the loan authorized under this section for 
purposes of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661 et 
seq.).
