 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for collegiate 
                   housing and infrastructure grants.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Collegiate Housing and 
Infrastructure Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS PERMITTED TO MAKE COLLEGIATE HOUSING 
              AND INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS.

    (a) In General.--Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
(relating to exemption from tax on corporations, certain trusts, etc.) 
is amended by redesignating subsection (s) as subsection (t) and by 
inserting after subsection (r) the following new subsection:
    ``(s) Treatment of Organizations Making Collegiate Housing and 
Infrastructure Improvement Grants.--
            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (c)(3) and 
        sections 170(c)(2)(B), 2055(a)(2), and 2522(a)(2), an 
        organization shall not fail to be treated as organized and 
        operated exclusively for charitable or educational purposes 
        solely because such organization makes collegiate housing and 
        infrastructure grants to an organization described in 
        subsection (c)(7) which applies the grant to its collegiate 
        housing property.
            ``(2) Housing and infrastructure grants.--For purposes of 
        paragraph (1), collegiate housing and infrastructure grants are 
        grants to provide, improve, operate, or maintain collegiate 
        housing property that may involve more than incidental social, 
        recreational, or private purposes, so long as such grants are 
        for purposes that would be permissible for a dormitory or other 
        residential facility of the college or university with which 
        the collegiate housing property is associated. A grant shall 
        not be treated as a collegiate housing and infrastructure grant 
        for purposes of paragraph (1) to the extent that such grant is 
        used to provide physical fitness facilities.
            ``(3) Collegiate housing property.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, collegiate housing property is property in which, 
        at the time of a grant or following the acquisition, lease, 
        construction, or modification of such property using such 
        grant, substantially all of the residents are full-time 
        students at the college or university in the community where 
        such property is located.
            ``(4) Grants to certain organizations holding title to 
        property, etc.--For purposes of this subsection, a collegiate 
        housing and infrastructure grant to an organization described 
        in subsection (c)(2) or (c)(7) holding title to property 
        exclusively for the benefit of an organization described in 
        subsection (c)(7) shall be considered a grant to the 
        organization described in subsection (c)(7) for whose benefit 
        such property is held.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to grants made in taxable years ending after the date of the enactment 
of this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
