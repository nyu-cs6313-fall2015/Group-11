    (a) Authority.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
shall carry out a pilot program under this section to use the authority 
under section 204(a)(2) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 
1710(a)(2)) to make payments to a qualified entity or entities to 
compensate for their costs of making in-person contact with mortgagors 
whose payments under covered mortgages are more than 60 days past due, 
for the purpose of--
            (1) identifying mortgagors eligible for loan modifications 
        or refinances and providing packages to the mortgagee for such 
        purposes;
            (2) identifying mortgagers not eligible for a loan 
        modification or refinance but willing to engage in pre-
        foreclosure sales or deeds in lieu of foreclosure, and 
        providing information to the mortgagee in order to facilitate 
        such actions;
            (3) identifying whether a home's current occupant is the 
        mortgagor or a renter, and if not occupied, taking steps to 
        locate and make contact with the mortgagor;
            (4) providing information to the Secretary and the 
        mortgagee regarding the condition of the home, in order to 
        facilitate any actions needed to prevent the deterioration and 
        loss of value of the home and assist the Department more 
        generally in its asset management responsibilities; and
            (5) providing all relevant information on mortgagors and 
        homes to the mortgagee on the loan and the Secretary in a
