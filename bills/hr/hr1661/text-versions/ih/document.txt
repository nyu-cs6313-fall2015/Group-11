      TITLE II--RESEARCH ON CANCER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT

Sec. 201. Sense of Congress.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Many people with cancer experience side effects, 
        symptoms, and late complications associated with their disease 
        and their treatment, which can have a serious adverse impact on 
        their health, well-being, and quality of life.
            (2) Many side effects and symptoms associated with cancer 
        and its treatment can be reduced or controlled by the provision 
        of timely symptom management and services and also by educating 
        people with cancer and their caregivers about the potential 
        effects before treatment begins.
            (3) Studies have found that individualized educational 
        intervention for cancer pain management from a registered nurse 
        was effective for patients with cancer being treated in 
        outpatient and home-based settings. Similarly, the number of 
        caregivers who said they were well informed and confident about 
        caregiving after attending a family caregiver cancer education 
        program increased after program attendance.
            (4) People with cancer benefit from having an educational 
        session with oncology nurses in advance of the initiation of 
        treatment to learn how to reduce the risk of and manage adverse 
        effects and maximize well-being. Helping patients to manage 
        their side effects reduces adverse events and the need for 
        urgent or inpatient care.
            (5) The Oncology Nursing Society has received reports from 
        its members that, because the Medicare program and other payers 
        do not cover the provision of patient treatment education, 
        patients and their caregivers often do not receive adequate 
        education before the onset of such patients' treatment for 
        cancer regarding the course of such treatment and the possible 
        side effects and symptoms such patients may experience. The 
        Oncology Nursing Society recommends that all patients being 
        treated for cancer have a one-on-one educational session with a 
        nurse in advance of the onset of such treatment so that such 
        patients and their caregivers receive the information they need 
        to help minimize adverse events related to such treatment and 
        maximize the well-being of such patients.
            (6) Insufficient or non-existent Medicare payments coupled 
        with poor investment in symptom management research contribute 
        to the inadequate education of patients, poor management and 
        monitoring of cancer symptoms, and inadequate handling of late 
        effects of cancer and its treatment.
            (7) People with cancer often do not have the symptoms 
        associated with their disease and the associated treatment 
        managed in a comprehensive or appropriate manner.
            (8) People with cancer deserve to have access to 
        comprehensive care that includes appropriate treatment and 
        symptom management.
            (9) Patients who receive infused chemotherapy likely obtain 
        some treatment education during the course of the 
        administration of their treatment; yet, many do not, and 
        individuals who may receive a different type of cancer care, 
        such as radiation or surgical interventions or oral 
        chemotherapy taken at home, likely do not receive treatment 
        education during their treatment.
            (10) Comprehensive cancer care must include access to 
        services and management associated with nausea, vomiting, 
        fatigue, depression, pain, and other symptoms.
            (11) The Institute of Medicine report, ``Ensuring Quality 
        Cancer Care'' asserts that ``much can be done to relieve the 
        symptoms, ease distress, provide comfort, and in other ways 
        improve the quality of life of someone with cancer. For a 
        person with cancer, maintenance of quality of life requires, at 
        a minimum, relief from pain and other distressing symptoms, 
        relief from anxiety and depressions, including the fear of 
        pain, and a sense of security that assistance will be readily 
        available if needed.''.
            (12) The Institute of Medicine report, ``Cancer Care for 
        the Whole Patient: Meeting Psychosocial Health Needs'' 
        recognizes that cancer patients' psychosocial needs include 
        information about their therapies and the potential side 
        effects.
            (13) As more than half of all cancer diagnoses occur among 
        individuals age 65 and older, the challenges of managing cancer 
        symptoms are growing for patients enrolled in the Medicare 
        program.
            (14) Provision of Medicare payment for comprehensive cancer 
        patient treatment education, coupled with expanded cancer 
        symptom management research, will help improve care and quality 
        of life for people with cancer from the time of diagnosis 
        through survivorship or end of life.

      TITLE II--RESEARCH ON CANCER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT

SEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) many people with cancer experience side effects, 
        symptoms, and late side effects associated with their disease 
        and their treatment, and such effects can have a serious 
        adverse impact on the effectiveness of their treatment, their 
        health, well-being, and quality of life;
            (2) with the number of cancer survivors continuing to grow, 
        addressing the effects of their symptoms and side effects is 
        becoming increasingly critical in reducing the burden of cancer 
        and its treatments;
            (3) although research is producing new insights into the 
        causes of and cures for cancer, efforts to manage the symptoms 
        and side effects of the disease and its treatments have not 
        kept pace; and
            (4) the National Institutes of Health should continue to 
        support research in the area of symptom management and the role 
        that nurses play in providing those interventions.

SEC. 202. NIH RESEARCH ON CANCER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT.

    (a) In General.--The Director of the National Institutes of Health 
shall expand, intensify, and coordinate programs for the conduct and 
support of research with respect to--
            (1) improving the treatment and management of symptoms and 
        side effects associated with cancer and cancer treatment; and
            (2) evaluating the role of nursing interventions in the 
        amelioration of such symptoms and side effects.
    (b) Administration.--The Director of the National Institutes of 
Health is encouraged to carry out this section through the Director of 
the National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with at least the 
directors of the National Institute of Nursing Research, the National 
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute 
of Mental Health, the National Center on Minority Health and Health 
Disparities, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative 
Medicine, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
