                                 A BILL


 
    To amend title 5, United States Code, to provide that matching 
  contributions to the Thrift Savings Fund for Members of Congress be 
     made contingent on Congress completing action on a concurrent 
 resolution on the budget, for the fiscal year involved, which reduces 
                  the deficit, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lead By Example Act''.

SEC. 2. CONDITION.

    Section 8432(c) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by 
adding at the end the following:
    ``(4)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no 
contribution under this subsection may be made for the benefit of any 
Member--
            ``(i) with respect to any pay period beginning before the 
        date on which Congress completes action on a concurrent 
        resolution on the budget for the fiscal year in which the first 
        day of such pay period occurs; and
            ``(ii) unless--
                    ``(I) the deficit for the fiscal year referred to 
                in clause (i) (as set forth in the concurrent 
                resolution on the budget for such fiscal year), is less 
                than
                    ``(II) the deficit for the preceding fiscal year 
                (as set forth in the concurrent resolution on the 
                budget for such preceding fiscal year).
    ``(B) If a determination under subparagraph (A)(ii) cannot be made 
with respect to a fiscal year (as referred to in subclause (I) thereof) 
due to a failure by Congress to complete action on a concurrent 
resolution on the budget for the preceding fiscal year (as referred to 
in subclause (II) thereof) the condition under subparagraph (A)(ii) 
shall be considered not to have been met for purposes of the fiscal 
year referred to in subclause (I) thereof.
    ``(C) Clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B) shall 
cease to apply after the date on which Congress completes action on a 
concurrent resolution on the budget for the first fiscal year, 
following the date of the enactment of this paragraph, for which there 
is no deficit (as determined based on the concurrent resolution on the 
budget for such fiscal year).
    ``(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the terms `concurrent 
resolution on the budget' and `deficit' have the respective meanings 
given them by section 3 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment 
Control Act of 1974.''.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    The amendment made by this Act shall be effective with respect to 
contributions for pay periods beginning in any fiscal year which begins 
after the date of the enactment of this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
