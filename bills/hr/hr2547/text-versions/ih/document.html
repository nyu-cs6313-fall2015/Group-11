                                 A BILL


 
To determine appropriate risk based capital requirements for community, 
                  mid-size, and regional institutions.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Determination of Appropriate Risk-
Based Capital Requirements for Community Financial Institutions Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINAL RULES PENDING IMPACT STUDY.

    (a) In General.--The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency (in this Act collectively referred to 
as the ``Federal banking agencies'') shall conduct an empirical study 
in accordance with subsection (b) prior to issuing any final rule in 
relation to all proposed regulatory capital rules issued by the Federal 
banking agencies for the international Basel III agreement (``Basel III 
Rules'').
    (b) Issues To Be Studied.--The study required by this section shall 
include--
            (1) the potential impact of the Basel III Rules on the 
        financial services sector of the United States, and 
        specifically community, mid-size, and regional financial 
        institutions, including changes to required capital levels in 
        the aggregate, per asset class and institution size;
            (2) the long-term potential impact of the Basel III Rules, 
        including changes to the current risk-weight framework;
            (3) the cost and complexity of the Basel III Rules for 
        community financial institutions;
            (4) the potential indicators of community banks having to 
        maintain higher leverage capital ratios and higher total risk-
        based capital ratios than non-community banks, and if such 
        capital levels are commensurate with higher historical losses 
        or greater risk;
            (5) the historical probability of default and loss given 
        default of residential mortgage loans and the proposed risk 
        weightings in the Basel III Rules, and whether such proposed 
        risk weightings are appropriately and fairly calibrated, 
        specifically for community, mid-size, and regional financial 
        institutions; and
            (6) the impact of the Basel III Rules on real estate 
        markets, and specifically, residential mortgage lending and 
        home equity lines of credit.
    (c) Exception for Global Systemically Important Banks.--The delay 
in rulemaking required under subsection (a) shall not apply to rules 
applicable to global systemically important banks, as identified by the 
Financial Stability Board.

SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION.

    Any financial institution may voluntarily provide information for 
the study upon the request of the agencies, but may not be required to 
provide such information.

SEC. 4. FINAL REPORT.

    (a) Availability to the Public.--A final report on the completed 
study required by this Act shall be made available to the public for 
notice and comment for a period of not less than 90 days.
    (b) Report to Congress.--The Federal banking agencies shall issue a 
report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the 
Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives, and testify before such committees, on the results of 
the study required by this Act and a summary of the comments received 
under subsection (a).
    (c) Review.--The Federal banking agencies shall review any comments 
submitted under subsections (a) and (b) and considerations provided 
pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), and following such review, shall 
prescribe new rules, if appropriate, based on the results of the study 
and such comments and considerations. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, a new rulemaking following such comment period shall 
include an additional comment period of not less than 90 days.

SEC. 5. DELAY OF RULEMAKING.

    A regulation issued by the Federal banking agencies to implement 
the International Basel III agreement on general risk-based capital 
requirements may not take effect until after the end of the 1-year 
period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
