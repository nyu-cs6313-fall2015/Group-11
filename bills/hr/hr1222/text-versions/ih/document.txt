                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Compact of Free Association of 1985 to provide for 
adequate Compact-impact aid to affected States and territories, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Compact-Impact Aid Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In approving the Compact of Free Association it was not 
        the intent of Congress to cause adverse consequences for 
        States, territories, and other jurisdictions of the United 
        States.
            (2) Congress declared that if any adverse consequences to 
        States, territories, and other jurisdictions of the United 
        States resulted from implementation of the Compact of Free 
        Association, Congress would act sympathetically and 
        expeditiously to redress those adverse consequences.
            (3) The Government Accountability Office has reported that 
        migration from the Freely Associated States has had a 
        significant impact on Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
        Mariana Islands, and the State of Hawaii and some areas of the 
        continental United States.
            (4) By placing demands on local governments for health, 
        educational, and other social services, migration under the 
        Compact has adversely affected the budgetary resources of 
        several States and territories.
            (5) Insufficient sums have been appropriated to cover the 
        costs incurred by Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
        Mariana Islands, and the State of Hawaii, resulting from 
        increased demands placed on health, educational, and other 
        social services by individuals from the Federated States of 
        Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the 
        Republic of Palau.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to address the unfunded 
mandate and adverse financial consequences resulting from the Compact 
by meeting the obligations set forth in the Compact.

SEC. 3. ENSURING MANDATORY APPROPRIATIONS AND HEALTH SERVICES 
              REIMBURSEMENT AS PART OF COMPACT-IMPACT AID.

    (a) In General.--Section 104(e)(6) of the Compact of Free 
Association Act of 1985 (48 U.S.C. 1904(e)(6)) is amended to read as 
follows:
            ``(6) Impact costs.--
                    ``(A) Authorization and continuing 
                appropriations.--

                        authorized and appropriated to the Secretary of 
                        the Interior, for fiscal year 2013, 
                        $185,000,000 with subsequent increases as 
                        needed to address significant increases in 
                        migration for grants to any local government of 
                        the United States that demonstrates financial 
                        strain due to demands on public services by 
                        significant immigration of individuals from the 
                        Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of 
                        the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of 
                        Palau, and to aid in defraying costs incurred 
                        by their governments as a result of increased 
                        demands placed on health, educational, social, 
                        or public safety services, or infrastructure 
                        related to such services due to the residence 
                        of qualified nonimmigrants.
