        pathogen indicators for coastal recreation waters.
            (2) Revisions to rapid testing methods.--If a rapid testing 
        method identified under paragraph (1) will make results 
        available in less time and improve the accuracy and 
        reproducibility of results when compared to the existing rapid 
        testing method, the Administrator shall complete an evaluation 
        and validation of the rapid testing method as expeditiously as
