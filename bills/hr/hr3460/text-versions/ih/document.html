To amend the Mineral Leasing Act to require that a portion of revenues 
 from new Federal mineral and geothermal leases be paid to States for 
  use to supplement the education of students in kindergarten through 
 grade 12 and public support of institutions of higher education, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Education and Energy Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. USE OF REVENUES FROM NEW FEDERAL MINERAL AND GEOTHERMAL LEASES 
              FOR PAYMENTS TO STATE FOR EDUCATION.

    Section 35(a) of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191) is amended 
by inserting ``(1)'' before the first sentence, and by adding at the 
end the following new paragraph:
            ``(2)(A) Of amounts otherwise required under paragraph (1) 
        to be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury each 
        fiscal year that are derived from leases for tracts located in 
        a State, the Secretary shall pay to the State 33 percent for 
        use to supplement the education of students in kindergarten 
        through grade 12 and to supplement public support of 
        institutions of higher education.
            ``(B) Of the amounts otherwise required under paragraph (1) 
        to be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury each 
        fiscal year that are not required to be used for payments under 
        subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall pay to 
        States, in equal amounts, 17 percent for use to supplement the 
        education of students in kindergarten through grade 12 and to 
        supplement public support of institutions of higher education.
            ``(C) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall apply only with 
        respect to amounts that--
            ``(i) are received by the United States under leases 
        entered into under this Act and the Geothermal Steam Act of 
        1970 after the date of enactment of the Education and Energy 
        Act of 2013; and
            ``(ii) exceed the amount of revenues that the Congressional 
        Budget Office previously estimated would be received under such 
        leases in the fiscal year.
            ``(D) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply with 
        respect to amounts required by paragraph (1) to be paid into, 
        reserved, appropriated, as part of the reclamation fund.''.
