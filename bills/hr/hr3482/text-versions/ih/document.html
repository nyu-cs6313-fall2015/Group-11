the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78fff-2(c)) 
is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by amending subparagraph (B) to read 
        as follows:

                described under paragraph (4);''; and

            (1) In general.--Section 8 of the Securities Investor 
        Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78fff-2) is amended by adding 
        at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(g) Prohibition on Certain Recoveries.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Act, a trustee may not recover any property 
transferred by the debtor to a customer before the filing date unless, 
at the time of such transfer, such customer--

                        adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of

                enforcement personnel that the debtor was involved in 
                such fraudulent activity.''.
            (2) Construction.--Nothing in this Act, or the amendments 
        made by this Act, shall be construed as prohibiting a trustee 
        appointed under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 
        from recovering property transferred by a debtor to a person 
        who is not a customer of the debtor.
    (d) Appointment of Trustees.--
            (1) In general.--Section 5(b)(3) of the Securities Investor 
        Protection Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 78eee(b)(3)) is amended to 
        read as follows:

                decree under paragraph (1), such court shall forthwith

                trustee and as attorney from among the persons selected

                liquidation proceedings, and shall periodically update 
                the list, as appropriate. With respect to a debtor and
