                                 A BILL


 
 To increase assessment accuracy to better measure student achievement 
   and provide States with greater flexibility on assessment design.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Assessment Accuracy and Improvement 
Act''.

SEC. 2. USE OF ADAPTIVE ASSESSMENTS.

    Section 1111 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 
(20 U.S.C. 6311) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(n) Use of Adaptive Assessments.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        this Act, a State may provide that the assessments to be used 
        to measure student achievement by that State, and by the 
        schools and local educational agencies of that State, shall be 
        adaptive assessments (rather than the assessments otherwise 
        required by this Act) that accurately assess student 
        achievement above and below grade level while also measuring 
        grade-level performance.
            ``(2) Definition.--For purposes of paragraph (1), an 
        adaptive assessment is an assessment that changes its 
        difficulty according to the performance of a student but 
        reports the outcome of the assessment on a scale that is common 
        to all students.
            ``(3) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall ensure that the 
        protocol for evaluating the adaptive assessments is included in 
        peer review guidance documents.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
