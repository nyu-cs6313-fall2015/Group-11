Commission Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report 
        that nearly 26,000,000 Americans have diabetes in addition to 
        an estimated 79,000,000 American adults that have pre-diabetes, 
        an increase of 2,000,000 Americans with diabetes and 22,000,000 
        American adults with pre-diabetes since 2008.
            (2) Diabetes affects 8.3 percent of Americans of all ages 
        and 11.3 percent of adults age 20 and older. Individuals of 
        racial and ethnic minorities continue to have higher rates of 
        diabetes than individuals not of such minorities, as 
        demonstrated by the following: 16.1 percent of all adult 
        American Indians and Alaskan Natives have diabetes; 12.6 
        percent of all adult African-Americans have diabetes; 11.8 
        percent of all adult Hispanics have diabetes; and 8.4 percent 
        of all adult Asian-Americans have diabetes, while 7.1 percent 
        of all non-Hispanic Whites have diabetes.
            (3) Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the 
        United States.
            (4) People with diabetes are more likely than people 
        without diabetes to have heart attacks, strokes, high blood 
        pressure, kidney failure, blindness, and require amputations.
            (5) Total national costs associated with diabetes in 2007 
        exceeded $174,000,000,000, according to the Centers for Disease 
        Control and Prevention.
            (6) One in three Medicare dollars is currently spent on 
        people with diabetes.
            (7) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projects 
        that as many as 1 in 3 American adults could have diabetes by 
        2050 if current trends continue.
            (8) There are 35 Federal departments, agencies, and offices 
        involved in the implementation of Federal diabetes activities.
