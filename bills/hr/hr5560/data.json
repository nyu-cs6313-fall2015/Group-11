Caps the amount of such award. Prohibits a student from receiving an award for more than two semesters or the equivalent of two semesters.\n\nRequires the IHEs to provide each student who receives an award that does not fully cover the amount due on the student's outstanding tuition with information on the financial assistance available from any other source.\n\nDirects the Secretary to create, and each student that receives an award to complete, an online financial literacy survey that includes matters relating to budgeting and saving, student loan debt, and career planning."
