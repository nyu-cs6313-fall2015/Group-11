                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit monetary payments by the Federal Government to employees, 
 officers, and elected officials of foreign countries for purposes of 
 bribery, coercion, or any activity that is illegal or undermines the 
  rule of law or corrupts a public officer or the office such officer 
                  represents, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No More Ghost Money Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On May 4, 2013, President of Afghanistan Hamid Karzai 
        revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency regularly made 
        cash payments to his office.
            (2) The corrupt practice of making such payments undermines 
        the rule of law and undercuts a central strategic United States 
        goal in Afghanistan: establishing a credible and transparent 
        Afghan government responsive to popular concerns.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF PAYMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS AFFILIATED WITH FOREIGN 
              GOVERNMENTS.

    (a) Prohibition.--Subject to section 5, no department or agency of 
the Federal Government or contractor to the Federal Government may make 
a monetary payment to an employee, officer, elected official, or 
representative of the government of a foreign country for the purposes 
of bribery, coercion, or any activity that is illegal or undermines the 
rule of law or corrupts a public officer or the office such officer 
represents.
    (b) Procedures.--The President shall establish procedures to carry 
out and enforce the prohibition under subsection (a).

SEC. 4. REPORT ON PAYMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS AFFILIATED WITH THE 
              GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN.

    Subject to section 5, not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency 
shall submit to Congress a report on all monetary payments made by the 
Central Intelligence Agency to employees, officers, elected officials, 
or representatives of the Government of Afghanistan on or after 
September 11, 2001. Such report shall include--
            (1) a description of all payments made to employees, 
        officers, elected officials, or representatives of the 
        Government of Afghanistan on or after September 11, 2001, 
        including any receipts provided by such employees, officers, 
        elected officials, or representatives and, to the extent 
        possible, copies of such receipts;
            (2) the legal basis for making such payments;
            (3) the strategic goals supported by such payments; and
            (4) the effectiveness of such payments in achieving such 
        strategic goals.

SEC. 5. NATIONAL SECURITY WAIVER.

    The President may waive a requirement of section 3 or 4 if the 
President certifies to Congress that fulfilling such requirement would 
harm the national security of the United States or members of the Armed 
Forces.
                                 <all>
