  <summary>5/29/2014--Introduced.
Trade Protection Not Troll Protection Act - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to revise certain legal standards used to consider whether a domestic industry exists or is in the process of being established with respect to foreign countries that unlawfully import articles into the United States in violation of U.S. infringement laws.

Considers an industry to exist if there is in the United States substantial investment in licensing activities that leads to the adoption and development of articles that incorporate the patent, copyright, trademark, mask work, or design of protected articles.

Prohibits a complainant alleging a violation from relying upon activities by its licensees unless the license leads to such adoption and development.

Prescribes requirements with respect to U.S. International Trade Commission investigations of alleged violations.</summary>
