SEC. 3. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES REGARDING 
              DIABETES PREVENTION UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The prevalence and cost of diabetes is a significant 
        concern for State Medicaid programs. By 2021, the Medicaid 
        program is expected to cover 13,000,000 people with diabetes 
        and about 9,000,000 people who may have pre-diabetes. By 2021, 
        States will spend an estimated $83,000,000,000 on individuals 
        with diabetes or pre-diabetes.
            (2) The National Diabetes Prevention Program, as 
        established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
        has been proven to reduce the onset of diabetes in at-risk 
        adults by 58 percent, using a cost-effective, community-based 
        intervention.
    (b) Sense of the House of Representatives.--It is the sense of the 
House of Representatives that the National Diabetes Prevention Program 
presents an opportunity for States to reduce the incidence of diabetes 
among individuals enrolled in their Medicaid programs.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
