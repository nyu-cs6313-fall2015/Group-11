  <summary>3/26/2014--Introduced.
Interstate Milk Freedom Act of 2014 - Prohibits a federal department, agency, or court from taking any action that would prohibit, regulate, or otherwise restrict the interstate traffic of milk or a milk product that is unpasteurized and packaged for direct human consumption if: (1) such action is based solely upon a determination that because the milk or milk product is unpasteurized it is adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise in violation of federal law; (2) the milk or milk product's state of origin allows unpasteurized milk or unpasteurized milk products to be distributed for direct human consumption by any means; (3) the milk or milk product is produced, packaged, and moved in compliance with the laws of such state of origin; and (4) the milk or milk product is moved from the state of origin for transport to another state which allows the distribution of unpasteurized milk or unpasteurized milk products for direct human consumption.</summary>
