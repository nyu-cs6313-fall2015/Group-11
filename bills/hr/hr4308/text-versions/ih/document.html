    To prohibit Federal interference with the interstate traffic of 
unpasteurized milk and milk products that are packaged for direct human 
                              consumption.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Interstate Milk Freedom Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. INTERSTATE TRAFFIC OF UNPASTEURIZED MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), section 361 of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 264), and any regulations or other guidance 
thereunder, a Federal department, agency, or court may not take any 
action (including any administrative, civil, criminal, or other action) 
that would prohibit, interfere with, regulate, or otherwise restrict 
the interstate traffic of milk, or a milk product, that is 
unpasteurized and packaged for direct human consumption, if--
            (1) such prohibition, interference, regulation, or 
        restriction is based on a determination that, solely because 
        such milk or milk product is unpasteurized, such milk or milk 
        product is adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise in violation 
        of Federal law;
            (2) the milk or milk product's State of origin allows (by 
        law, regulation, or policy) unpasteurized milk or unpasteurized 
        milk products to be distributed for direct human consumption by 
        any means, including any form of retail sale, direct farm to 
        consumer distribution, or cowshare;
            (3) the milk or milk product is produced, packaged, and 
        moved in compliance with the laws of such State of origin, 
        including any such laws relating to labeling, warning, and 
        packaging requirements; and
            (4) the milk or milk product is moved from the State of 
        origin with the intent to transport the milk or milk product to 
        another State which allows the distribution of unpasteurized 
        milk or unpasteurized milk products for direct human 
        consumption, as described in paragraph (2), irrespective of 
        whether the applicable laws of such other State are identical 
        to the laws of the State of origin.
    (b) No Preemption.--Nothing in this Act preempts any State law.
    (c) Definitions.--In this Act, the following definitions apply:

                    (A) that includes a legal bill of sale to the 
                consumer for an interest in the animal or dairy herd 
                and a boarding contract under which the consumer boards 
                the animal or dairy herd in which the consumer has an 
                interest with the farmer for care and milking; and
                    (B) under which the consumer is entitled to receive

                pasteurization, before being consumed by humans.
            (5) The term ``pasteurized'' means the process of--
