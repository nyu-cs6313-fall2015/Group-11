  <summary>11/18/2014--Introduced.
Amends the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 with respect to the one-year period after a service member's military service during which: (1) a court may stay proceedings to enforce an obligation on real or personal property owned by the service member before such military service; and (2) any sale, foreclosure, or seizure of such property shall be invalid without a court order or waiver agreement signed by the service member.

Repeals the revival, effective January 1, 2015, of the old nine-month period in place of the one-year period granted by such Act.</summary>
