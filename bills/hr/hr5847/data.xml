  <summary>12/10/2014--Introduced.
Fifth Amendment Restoration Act of 2014 - Prohibits government seizures of private&#160;property&#160;under any federal law providing for civil asset forfeiture.

Defines "property" to include real property, financial assets, and commonly held property owned by more than one person.

Bars federal agencies from: (1) participating in or benefiting from any multiple-jurisdiction, equitable sharing, or shared civil asset forfeiture program with any state or local government; or (2) accepting or adopting property seized by a state or local government.

Excludes from&#160;such prohibitions: (1) contraband, including illegal imports or exports, and anything the possession of which is a crime; or (2) property subject to forfeiture or seizure because the owner has first been convicted of a criminal offense.</summary>
