SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) College costs have increased tremendously over the past 
        decade. Between academic year 2002-2003 and academic year 2012-
        2013--
                    (A) published tuition and fees for students at 
                public 4-year institutions of higher education 
                increased from $5,213 to $8,655 or by 66 percent beyond 
                the rate of inflation,
                    (B) published tuition and fees for students at 
                public 2-year institutions of higher education 
                increased from $2,129 to $3,131 or by 47 percent beyond 
                the rate of inflation, and
                    (C) published tuition and fees for students at 
                private 4-year institutions of higher education 
                increased from $22,974 to $29,056 or by 26 percent 
                beyond the rate of inflation.
            (2) Federal financial aid for students has also increased 
        rapidly but failed to mitigate the issues of rising college 
        costs. Between academic year 2001-2002 and academic year 2011-
        2012--
                    (A) the amount of Federal financial aid in the form 
                of Federal Pell Grants, Federal student loans, campus-
                based aid, veterans educational benefits, and tax 
                credits increased from $72.3 billion to $173.8 billion 
                or by 140 percent beyond the rate of inflation, and
                    (B) the Federal Government's share of total student 
                aid administered increased from 67 percent to 73 
                percent.
