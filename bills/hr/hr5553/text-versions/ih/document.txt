                        homeowner for a loan modification on the same 
                        terms as if the successor homeowner had been 
                        the original borrower and mortgagor; and

                under State law; or
                    ``(B) empower a lender to place any restrictions on 
                the right of successor homeowners protected by 
                subsection (d) to assume a mortgage.

                5 percent less than the appraised value of the dwelling 
                that is subject to the mortgage; and
            ``(B) provide that the mortgagor, the estate of the 
        mortgagor, or the heirs of the mortgagor shall not be liable 
        for any difference between the amount of indebtedness under the 
        mortgage and the amount recovered by the mortgagee from--''.
