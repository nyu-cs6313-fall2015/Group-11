                               RESOLUTION


 
    Commemorating the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the 
            Corporation for National and Community Service.

Whereas the Corporation for National and Community Service (in this preamble 
        referred to as the ``CNCS'') was established under section 191 of the 
        National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12651), as added 
        by section 202 of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 
        (Public Law 103-82; 107 Stat. 873);
Whereas, since 1993, the CNCS has operated as an independent Federal agency, 
        overseeing all national and community service programs authorized by the 
        National and Community Service Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12501 et seq.) and 
        the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4950 et seq.);
Whereas the CNCS connects people of all ages and backgrounds with opportunities 
        to give back to their communities and the United States;
Whereas programs conducted by the CNCS strive to address national and local 
        needs, while renewing an ethic of civic responsibility and community 
        spirit in the United States by encouraging citizens to participate in 
        service;
Whereas, since 1993, millions of people in the United States have served in 
        AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, Learn and Serve America, and other CNCS 
        programs, addressing the most pressing challenges facing the United 
        States, from helping students graduate and supporting veterans and 
        military families to preserving the environment and helping communities 
        recover from natural disasters;
Whereas participants serve in tens of thousands of locations across the country, 
        bolstering the civic, neighborhood, and faith-based organizations that 
        are so vital to the economic and social well-being of the people of the 
        United States;
Whereas national service expands economic opportunity by creating more 
        sustainable, resilient communities and providing education, career 
        skills, and leadership abilities for those who serve;
Whereas national service represents a partnership between public and private 
        organizations, invests in community solutions, and leverages State and 
        local resources to strengthen community impact;
Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed the Serve America Act (Public Law 111-13; 123 
        Stat. 1460), authorizing the expansion of national service, expanding 
        opportunities to serve, increasing efficiency and accountability, and 
        strengthening the capacity of organizations and communities to solve 
        problems through the Social Innovation Fund, the Volunteer Generation 
        Fund, and other initiatives;
Whereas AmeriCorps and Senior Corps support the military community by engaging 
        veterans in service, helping veterans readjust to civilian life, and 
        providing support to military families;
Whereas more than 17,000 veterans have served as AmeriCorps members and have 
        helped veterans and military families access benefits and services, 
        conduct job searches, and provide safe and affordable housing;
Whereas the CNCS is working to increase the number of veterans and military 
        families served by and engaged in programs supported by the CNCS;
Whereas, since 1994, CNCS programs and members have provided critical services 
        to millions of people in the United States who have been affected by 
        floods, fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other disasters and 
        emergencies, helping families and communities rebuild their lives;
Whereas the CNCS has partnered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to 
        launch FEMA Corps, which strives to strengthen the disaster response 
        capacity of the United States, increase the reliability and diversity of 
        the disaster response workforce, promote an ethic of service, and 
        prepare young people for careers in emergency management; and
Whereas the Task Force on Expanding National Service established in July 2013 is 
        working to expand national service opportunities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the 20th anniversary of the establishment 
        of the Corporation for National and Community Service;
            (2) recognizes that, for 20 years, the Corporation for 
        National and Community Service has worked to improve lives, 
        strengthen communities, expand economic opportunity, foster 
        innovation and civic engagement, and engage millions of people 
        in the United States in solving critical problems through 
        national service;
            (3) recognizes that, since the inception of AmeriCorps in 
        1994, more than 820,000 people have served as AmeriCorps 
        members, serving approximately 1,000,000,000 hours, mobilizing 
        millions of volunteers, and improving the lives of countless 
        people in the United States;
            (4) welcomes the efforts of the Corporation for National 
        and Community Service to increase the involvement of veterans 
        and military families in national service and to expand 
        services to the military community;
            (5) recognizes the goal of the Serve America Act (Public 
        Law 111-13; 123 Stat. 1460) to increase the number of approved 
        national service positions to 250,000 by 2017; and
            (6) recognizes and thanks all those who have served in 
        AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and other programs conducted by the 
        Corporation for National and Community Service for 
        demonstrating commitment, dedication, and patriotism through 
        their service to the people of the United States.
                                 <all>
