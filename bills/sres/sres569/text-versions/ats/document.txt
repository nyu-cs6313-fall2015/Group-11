                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating September 23, 2014, as ``National Falls Prevention 
  Awareness Day'' to raise awareness and encourage the prevention of 
                       falls among older adults.

Whereas adults who are age 65 or older (referred to in this preamble as ``older 
        adults'') are the fastest-growing population in the United States;
Whereas the number of older adults in the United States is expected to increase 
        from 35,000,000 older adults in 2000 to 79,700,000 older adults in 2040;
Whereas each year, 1 out of every 3 older adults in the United States falls;
Whereas falls are the leading cause of fatal and nonfatal injuries among older 
        adults;
Whereas in 2012, more than 2,400,000 older adults were treated in hospital 
        emergency departments for fall-related injuries, and more than 722,000 
        older adults were subsequently hospitalized from such injuries;
Whereas in 2011, more than 22,900 older adults in the United States died from 
        injuries related to unintentional falls;
Whereas in 2010, the total direct medical cost of fall-related injuries for 
        older adults, adjusted for inflation, was $30,000,000,000;
Whereas between 2004 and 2014, the rate of death from falls of older adults in 
        the United States has risen sharply;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that if the rate 
        of falls does not decrease, the annual cost of injuries from falls will 
        reach an estimated $67,700,000,000 by 2020; and
Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing falls by utilizing 
        cost-effective strategies, such as exercise programs to improve balance 
        and strength, medication management, vision improvement, comprehensive 
        clinical assessments, and reduction of home hazards: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 23, 2014, as ``National Falls 
        Prevention Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes that there are proven, cost-effective falls 
        prevention programs and policies;
            (3) commends the 72 member organizations of the Falls Free 
        Coalition, and the falls prevention coalitions in 42 States and 
        the District of Columbia, for their efforts to work together to 
        increase education and awareness about preventing falls among 
        adults who are age 65 or older (referred to in this resolution 
        as ``older adults'');
            (4) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and 
        local governments, the public health community, and health care 
        providers to work together to raise awareness of falls in an 
        effort to reduce the incidence of falls among older adults in 
        the United States;
            (5) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to 
        continue developing and evaluating interventions to prevent 
        falls among older adults that will translate into effective 
        community-based falls prevention programs;
            (6) urges the Administration for Community Living, the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and their partners 
        to continue to promote evidence-based programs and services in 
        communities across the United States to reduce the number of 
        older adults at risk of falling;
            (7) encourages State health departments and State Units on 
        Aging, which provide significant leadership in reducing 
        injuries and related health care costs, to collaborate with 
        organizations and individuals to reduce falls among older 
        adults in the United States; and
            (8) encourages experts in the field of falls prevention to 
        share best practices so that others can replicate their 
        success.
