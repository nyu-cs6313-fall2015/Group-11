                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine and condemning Russian 
                    military aggression in Ukraine.

Whereas, on February 26-27, 2014, armed men in unmarked military uniforms seized 
        key strategic objects in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (``Crimea'') 
        in Ukraine, including the building of the Crimean Parliament and 
        airports;
Whereas, as of March 4, 2014, the Government of Ukraine confirms that there are 
        approximately 16,000 Russian troops occupying Crimea;
Whereas, on February 28, 2014, President Barack Obama stated that the United 
        States is ``deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by 
        the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine'' and that it ``would be a 
        clear violation of Russia's commitment to respect the independence and 
        sovereignty and borders of Ukraine, and of international law'';
Whereas President Obama pledged that ``the United States will stand with the 
        international community in affirming that there will be costs for any 
        military intervention in Ukraine'';
Whereas the armed forces of the Russian Federation have violated Ukrainian 
        sovereignty, violated international law, threatened the stability of 
        Ukraine and the European continent, and compelled the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization (NATO) to meet in emergency session to consider 
        threats to Poland and other NATO members states; and
Whereas President Obama has announced his intention to work with Congress to 
        respond forcefully to the outrageous and dangerous misbehavior of the 
        Government of the Russian Federation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) strongly condemns the Russian Federation's military 
        incursion into Crimea, in clear violation of Ukraine's 
        territorial integrity and in contravention of international 
        law;
            (2) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to 
        immediately withdraw all unauthorized military personnel from 
        Crimea;
            (3) pledges to work urgently and in bipartisan fashion with 
        the President to identify a comprehensive package of economic 
        sanctions and other measures to compel President Vladimir Putin 
        to remove his armed forces from Ukrainian territory and return 
        that territory to full Ukrainian sovereign control;
            (4) calls upon the President to seek to reschedule a 
        meeting of the G8 nations, to take place as soon as 
        practicable, where the participating nations should consider a 
        United States proposal to formally expel the Russian 
        Federation;
            (5) urges the United States to propose to NATO that the 
        Alliance immediately suspend operation of the Russia-NATO 
        Council and expel the Russian Federation's military and 
        diplomatic representation in NATO;
            (6) urges the United States to work with other members of 
        the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) 
        to deploy monitors in Ukraine to help confirm that the security 
        of the Russian-speaking population is not threatened;
            (7) urges the President to consider downgrading United 
        States diplomatic representation with the Russian Federation, 
        including refraining from sending a new United States 
        ambassador to Moscow and closing United States consulates 
        general in Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok and requiring the 
        Government of the Russian Federation to make reciprocal steps 
        to close consulates in the United States;
            (8) calls on the President to utilize all tools, including 
        the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 
        (title IV of Public Law 112-208; 126 Stat. 1502), to expand the 
        Act's list of sanctioned individuals to impose sanctions on all 
        officials of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation 
        in the chain of command responsible for the invasion of Crimea, 
        leadership of the Duma responsible for condoning the invasion, 
        and Crimean officials complicit in its execution;
            (9) urges the President to consider additional sanctions, 
        such as suspension of eligibility of Russian citizens for 
        temporary or seasonal United States work visas; and
            (10) urges the leadership of FIFA to reconsider its 
        decision to place World Cup 2018 matches in Russia and instead 
        award those games to a more worthy alternative country.
