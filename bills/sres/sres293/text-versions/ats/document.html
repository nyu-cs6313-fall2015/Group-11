                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating the week beginning on November 18, 2013, as ``National 
                Tribal Colleges and Universities Week''.

Whereas there are 37 tribal colleges and universities operating on more than 75 
        campuses in 15 States;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities are tribally or Federally chartered 
        institutions of higher education and therefore have a unique 
        relationship with the Federal Government;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities serve students from more than 250 
        Federally recognized Indian tribes;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities offer students access to knowledge and 
        skills grounded in cultural traditions and values, including indigenous 
        languages, which enhance Indian communities and enrich the United States 
        as a whole;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities provide access to quality higher 
        education opportunities for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and other 
        individuals living in some of the most isolated and economically 
        depressed areas in the United States;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities are accredited institutions of higher 
        education that effectively prepare students to succeed in a global and 
        highly competitive workforce;
Whereas open enrollment policies have resulted in non-Indians constituting 
        nearly one-fifth of the students at tribal colleges and universities;
Whereas tribal colleges and universities are effectively providing access to 
        quality higher education opportunities to residents of reservation 
        communities and the North Slope of Alaska; and
Whereas the mission and achievements of tribal colleges and universities deserve 
        national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning on November 18, 2013, as 
        ``National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
        groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, 
        activities, and programs to demonstrate support for tribal 
        colleges and universities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
