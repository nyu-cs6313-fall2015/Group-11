                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           February 26, 2014

  Mr. Kaine (for himself, Mr. Portman, and Ms. Baldwin) submitted the 
   following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the 
                               Judiciary

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the goals and ideals of ``Career and Technical Education 
                                Month''.

Whereas a competitive global economy requires workers to be trained in skilled 
        professions;
Whereas in a National Association of Manufacturers report, 80 percent of 
        respondents indicate a moderate to severe shortage of qualified skilled 
        production employees, including frontline workers, such as machinists, 
        operators, craft workers, distributors, and technicians;
Whereas career and technical education (referred to in this preamble as ``CTE'') 
        has proven to be an effective solution to ensure that competitive, 
        skilled workers are ready, willing, and capable of holding jobs in high-
        wage, high-skill, and in-demand career fields, such as science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, nursing, allied 
        health, construction, information technology, energy sustainability, and 
        many other fields that are vital in keeping the United States 
        competitive in the global economy;
Whereas approximately 14,000,000 students are enrolled in CTE programs, which 
        exist in each State and in nearly 1,300 public high schools and 1,700 2-
        year colleges across the United States;
Whereas 10 of the 20 fastest growing occupations in the United States require an 
        associate's degree, or a degree with fewer requirements;
Whereas 13 of the 20 occupations with the largest number of new jobs projected 
        require on-the-job training and an associate's degree or certificate, 
        and nearly all such occupations require real-world skills that 
        individuals can master through CTE;
Whereas CTE matches employability skills with workforce demand and provides 
        relevant academic and technical coursework, leading to industry-
        recognized credentials for secondary and postsecondary education and 
        adult learners;
Whereas CTE students are significantly more likely than non-CTE students to 
        report developing problem-solving, project-completion, research, 
        mathematics, college application, work-related, communication, time 
        management, and critical thinking skills during high school; and
Whereas students at schools with highly-integrated, rigorous academic and CTE 
        programs have significantly higher achievement in reading, mathematics, 
        and science than students at schools with less integrated programs: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the month of February as ``Career and 
        Technical Education Month'' to celebrate career and technical 
        education across the United States;
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of Career and Technical 
        Education Month;
            (3) recognizes the importance of career and technical 
        education in preparing a well-educated and skilled workforce in 
        the United States; and
            (4) encourages educators, counselors, and administrators to 
        promote career and technical education as an option for 
        students.
                                 <all>
