                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate on the 10-year anniversary of NATO 
                     Allied Command Transformation.

Whereas, on June 19, 2003, NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT), was 
        formally established to increase military effectiveness and prepare the 
        Alliance for future security challenges;
Whereas, on June 19, 2013, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will 
        celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the establishment of NATO ACT;
Whereas the security of the United States and its NATO allies have been enhanced 
        by the establishment and continued work of NATO ACT;
Whereas for the past 10 years, ACT has been leading NATO's military 
        transformation, and providing relevant and timely support to NATO 
        operations, while developing partnerships around the globe to adapt to 
        the changing global security environment;
Whereas ACT is the only NATO headquarters in the United States, and the only 
        permanent NATO headquarters outside of Europe;
Whereas ACT provides state of the art education, training, and application of 
        best practices and lessons learned from past operations, and equips 
        Alliance troops with the tools they need to win today's wars;
Whereas ACT improves NATO's defense planning and develops compatible equipment 
        and common standards necessary to keep Alliance capabilities aligned;
Whereas NATO ACT has been integral to a NATO mission of promoting a Europe that 
        is whole, undivided, free, and at peace;
Whereas NATO ACT strengthened the ability of NATO to perform a full range of 
        missions throughout the world;
Whereas NATO ACT has provided crucial support and participation in the NATO 
        International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, as NATO 
        endeavors to help the people of Afghanistan create the conditions 
        necessary for security and successful development and reconstruction;
Whereas ACT employs personnel from 26 of the 28 NATO member nations and six of 
        the 41 NATO Partner nations and contributes more than $100,000,000 
        annually to the local economy;
Whereas NATO has been the cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation and 
        an enduring instrument for promoting stability in Europe and throughout 
        the world for over 60 years, representing the vital transatlantic bond 
        of solidarity between the United States and Europe, as NATO nations 
        share similar values and interests and are committed to the maintenance 
        of democratic principles;
Whereas the Chicago Summit Communique affirms that all NATO members ``are 
        determined that NATO will continue to play its unique and essential role 
        in ensuring our common defense and security'' and that NATO ``continues 
        to be effective in a changing world, against new threats, with new 
        capabilities and new partners'';
Whereas through the Alliance, the United States and Europe are effective and 
        steadfast partners in security, and ACT is well positioned to contribute 
        to the strength of the Alliance on both continents;
Whereas NATO ACT has done much to help NATO meet the global challenges of the 
        21st century, including the threat of terrorism, the spread of weapons 
        of mass destruction, instability caused by failed states, and threats to 
        global energy security; and
Whereas the 10th anniversary of NATO ACT is an opportunity to enhance and more 
        deeply entrench those principles, which continue to bind the alliance 
        together and guide our efforts today: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) celebrates the 10th anniversary of the establishment of 
        NATO Allied Command Transformation (NATO ACT);
            (2) recognizes NATO ACT's leading role in transforming 
        Alliance forces and capabilities, using new concepts such as 
        the NATO Response Force and new doctrines in order to improve 
        the Alliance's military effectiveness;
            (3) expresses appreciation for the continuing and close 
        partnership between the United States Government and NATO to 
        transform the Alliance;
            (4) remembers the 64 years NATO has served to ensure peace, 
        security, and stability in Europe throughout the world, and 
        urges the United States Government to continue to seek new ways 
        to deepen and expand its important relationships with NATO;
            (5) recognizes the service of the brave men and women who 
        have served to safeguard the freedom and security of the United 
        States and the whole of the transatlantic alliance;
            (6) honors the sacrifices of United States personnel, 
        allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and partners 
        in Afghanistan;
            (7) recognizes the outstanding partnership between the 
        local community in Norfolk, Virginia and NATO personnel 
        assigned to ACT;
            (8) reaffirms that NATO, through the new Strategic Concept, 
        is committed to helping the Alliance adapt and prepare for the 
        complex and demanding future security;
            (9) urges all NATO members to take concrete steps to 
        implement the Strategic Concept and to utilize the taskings 
        from the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago, Illinois, to address 
        current NATO operations, future capabilities and burden-sharing 
        issues, and strengthen the relationship between NATO and 
        partners around the world;
            (10) calls upon the President to use the momentum of the 
        occasion of the 10th anniversary of NATO ACT--
                    (A) to engage each of the member states of the 
                North Atlantic Treaty Organization in a dialogue about 
                the long-term health of the Alliance, and strongly 
                encourage each of the member states to make a serious 
                effort to protect defense budgets from further 
                reductions, better allocate and coordinate the 
                resources presently available, and recommit to spending 
                at least 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on 
                defense; and
                    (B) to examine and report to Congress on 
                recommendations that will lead to a stronger Alliance 
                in terms of military capability and readiness across 
                the 28 member states, with particular focus on the 
                smaller member states; and
            (11) conveys appreciation for the steadfast partnership 
        between NATO and the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
