                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring the life, accomplishments, and legacy of Billy Frank, Jr., and 
                 expressing condolences on his passing.

Whereas in the 1850s, the United States Government signed a series of treaties 
        with Washington State tribes under which the tribes granted millions of 
        acres of land to the United States in exchange for the establishment of 
        reservations and the recognition of traditional hunting and fishing 
        rights;
Whereas Billy Frank, Jr., was born to Willie Frank, Sr., and Angeline Frank on 
        March 9, 1931, at Frank's Landing on the banks of the Nisqually River in 
        Washington State;
Whereas the tireless efforts and dedication of Billy Frank, Jr., led to a 
        historic legal victory that ensured that the United States would honor 
        promises made in treaties with the Washington tribes;
Whereas Billy Frank, Jr., was first arrested in December of 1945, at the age of 
        14, for fishing for salmon in the Nisqually River;
Whereas Billy Frank, Jr., was subsequently arrested more than 50 times for 
        exercising his treaty-protected right to fish for salmon;
Whereas over the years, Billy Frank, Jr., and other tribal members staged 
        ``fish-ins'' that often placed the protestors in danger of being 
        arrested or attacked;
Whereas during these fish-ins, Billy Frank, Jr., and others demanded that they 
        be allowed to fish in historically tribal waters, a right the Nisqually 
        had reserved in the Treaty of Medicine Creek;
Whereas declining salmon runs in Washington waters resulted in increased arrests 
        of tribal members exercising their fishing rights under the Treaty;
Whereas, on February 12, 1974, in the case of United States v. Washington, Judge 
        George Hugo Boldt of the United States District Court for the Western 
        District of Washington issued a decision that affirmed the right of 
        Washington treaty tribes to take up to half of the harvestable fish in 
        tribal fishing waters and reaffirmed that the United States must honor 
        treaties made with Native American tribes;
Whereas the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of the United 
        States upheld the Boldt decision, and the treaty tribes became co-
        managers of the salmon resource in the State of Washington;
Whereas after the Boldt decision, Billy Frank, Jr., continued his fight to 
        protect natural resources, salmon, and a healthy environment;
Whereas the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, where Billy Frank, Jr., 
        served as chairman, works to establish working relationships with State 
        agencies and non-Indian groups to manage fisheries, restore and protect 
        habitats, and protect tribal treaty rights;
Whereas Billy Frank, Jr., refused to be bitter in the face of jail, racism, and 
        abuse, and his influence was felt not just in Washington State but 
        around the world;
Whereas Billy Frank, Jr., was awarded the Albert Schweitzer Prize for 
        Humanitarianism, the Common Cause Award for Human Rights Efforts, the 
        American Indian Distinguished Service Award, the Washington State 
        Environmental Excellence Award, and the Wallace Stegner Award for his 
        years of service and dedication to his battle;
Whereas the legacy of Billy Frank, Jr., will live on in stories, in memories, 
        and every time a tribal member exercises his or her right to harvest 
        salmon in Washington State; and
Whereas the legacy of Billy Frank, Jr., transcends his 83 years and will provide 
        inspiration to those still around today and those still to come: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors the life, legacy, and many accomplishments of 
        Billy Frank, Jr.; and
            (2) extends its heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the 
        family of Billy Frank, Jr., the Nisqually Tribe, all Native 
        Americans, and all people around the world who were inspired by 
        his example.
                                 <all>
