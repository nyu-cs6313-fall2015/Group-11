  <summary>6/18/2014--Introduced.
Reaffirms that it is U.S. policy to support the Republic of Moldova's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity.

 Supports the Strategic Dialogue as a means to strengthen relations between the Republic of Moldova and the United States and enhance the democratic, economic, rule of law, and security reforms being implemented by the Republic of Moldova.

 Encourages: (1) the President and the Department of State to enhance U.S. cooperation with the government of Moldova and civil society organizations, and (2) the President to expedite implementation of the Act relating to "United States International Programming to Ukraine and Neighboring Regions."

Affirms the Republic of Moldova's sovereign right to determine its own partnerships free of external coercion and affirms Moldova's right to associate with the European Union (EU) or any regional organization.

Urges the EU to continue to work for greater political, economic, and social integration with the Republic of Moldova.

Calls upon the Government of Russia to: (1) withdraw its military forces from within the internationally recognized territory of the Republic of Moldova, (2) refrain from economic coercion, and (3) cease actions that support separatist movements in Moldova.

Supports confidence-building measures between the government of Moldova and the authorities in the Transnistria region in order to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

 Affirms that lasting stability and security in Europe is a key U.S. priority that can only be achieved if the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all European countries are respected.</summary>
