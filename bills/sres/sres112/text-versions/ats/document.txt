   Commending employees of the Senate Post Office, employees of the 
  Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, members of the Capitol Police, and 
      members of the Capitol Hill community for their courage and 
professionalism following the biochemical attack against the Senate on 
                            April 16, 2013.

Whereas approximately 30,000 legislative branch employees work in the United

        Senate, 11,500 employees of the House of Representatives, and 12,800 
        employees of other entities;
Whereas the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate implemented enhanced mail screening 
        procedures following the opening of a letter containing anthrax spores 
        that was delivered to the Senate on October 15, 2001;
Whereas employees of the Senate Post Office mail screening facility in Landover, 
        Maryland, serve as the first line of defense of the Senate against 
        biochemical threats delivered through the mail;
Whereas employees of the Senate Post Office mail screening facility in Landover, 
        Maryland, successfully intercepted an envelope that tested positive for 
        the deadly poison ricin on April 16, 2013;
Whereas employees of the Senate Post Office mail screening facility in Landover, 
        Maryland, immediately implemented emergency protocols and contacted the 
        Capitol Police and medical emergency response teams; and
Whereas the Capitol Police, other law enforcement agencies, and medical 
        professionals responded expeditiously to the mail screening facility in 
        Landover, Maryland, and performed their duties with courage and 
        professionalism in spite of the threat of toxic exposure: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends employees of the Senate Post Office, employees 
        of the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, members of the Capitol 
        Police, and members of the Capitol Hill community for their

        April 16, 2013;
            (2) recognizes the congressional leadership, congressional 
        employees, the Capitol Police, and the Office of the Attending

        professionalism of the employees of the Senate Post Office,
