                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the contributions of teachers to the civic, cultural, and 
               economic well-being of the United States.

Whereas education and knowledge are the foundation of the current and future 
        strength of the United States;
Whereas teachers and other educators deserve the respect of their students and 
        communities for their selfless dedication to community service and the 
        future of the children of the United States;
Whereas the purpose of ``National Teacher Day'', which will be observed on May 
        6, 2014, is to raise public awareness of the unquantifiable 
        contributions teachers make to society and to promote greater respect 
        and understanding for the teaching profession; and
Whereas students, schools, communities, and a number of organizations 
        representing educators are hosting teacher appreciation events in 
        recognition of National Teacher Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the contributions of teachers and other 
        educators to the civic, cultural, and economic well-being of 
        the United States; and
            (2) expresses gratitude for the work done by teachers and 
        educators and encourages students, parents, school 
        administrators, and public officials to participate in teacher 
        appreciation events on National Teacher Day.
                                 <all>
