  <summary>6/26/2014--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that President Obama should:

 publicly declare that no deferred action program granting relief from immigration enforcement shall apply to any unaccompanied migrant child who unlawfully enters the United States; publicly discourage people in Central America and elsewhere from sending their children on a dangerous journey through Mexico to the United States; begin fully enforcing the immigration laws; ensure that each state that is affected by the surge in unaccompanied migrant children entering the United States has the resources to address this crisis while ensuring that such children are treated humanely; and work with Mexico and the countries in Central America to improve security along the international borders between Mexico and Guatemala, and Mexico and Belize.</summary>
