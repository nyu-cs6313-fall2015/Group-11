   Commemorating the 20\th\ anniversary of the Wright Museum of WWII 
                  History in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire.

Whereas on July 16, 1994, the Wright Museum of WWII History opened as an 
        educational institution in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, founded by David 
        Wright;
Whereas for the past 20 years the Wright Museum has fulfilled its mission to 
        preserve and share the stories of the people of the United States during 
        World War II, and is the only United States museum that exclusively 
        focuses on the contributions and enduring legacy of World War II-era 
        Americans;
Whereas the Wright Museum accomplishes its mission through the careful 
        preservation and thoughtful display of its extensive permanent 
        collection of World War II-era items and memorabilia from the years 
        between 1939 and 1945;
Whereas the Wright Museum is unique among traditional World War II museums in 
        that the over 14,000 items in its permanent collection are 
        representative of both the battlefield and the United States homefront;
Whereas the Wright Museum has established a national reputation as a repository 
        for historically significant World War II-era items and memorabilia;
Whereas the Wright Museum uses its permanent collection to introduce visitors to 
        a seminal period in United States history and place that period into 
        historical context;
Whereas for 2 decades the Wright Museum has educated, entertained, and inspired 
        over 200,000 visitors from across the United States and around the 
        world; and
Whereas the Wright Museum remains dedicated to David Wright's vision of 
        providing a vivid perspective on the profound and enduring impact of the 
        World War II experience on United States society: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commends the Wright Museum of WWII History staff, 
        volunteers, and board of directors for their efforts to 
        encourage the study of a significant period in United States 
        history;
            (2) applauds the Wright Museum of WWII History's mission to 
        raise awareness of the contributions and lasting legacy of 
        World War II-era Americans; and
            (3) recognizes the significance of July 16, 2014, as the 
        20\th\ anniversary of the opening of the Wright Museum of WWII 
        History.
