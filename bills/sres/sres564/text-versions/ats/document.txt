                               RESOLUTION


 
    Honoring conservation on the centennial of the passenger pigeon 
                              extinction.

Whereas the death of Martha, the last passenger pigeon, on September 1, 1914, at 
        the Cincinnati Zoo, and the extinction of the passenger pigeon helped to 
        catalyze the American conservation movement of the early 20th century, 
        resulting in new laws and practices that prevented the extinction of 
        many species;
Whereas the story of the passenger pigeon can serve to encourage communities to 
        explore connections between humans and the natural world, and inspire 
        people to build sustainable relationships with other species;
Whereas the passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) was once the most abundant 
        bird in North America, with a population exceeding 3,000,000,000 and 
        with flocks so large that they could darken the skies for hours and even 
        days at a time;
Whereas due to unregulated market hunting in the 19th century and deforestation, 
        the passenger pigeon population plummeted toward extinction;
Whereas Project Passenger Pigeon, a consortium of over 150 institutions, 
        scientists, conservationists, educators, artists, musicians, filmmakers, 
        and others throughout the Nation, is using the centenary of the 
        extinction of the species to tell the story of the passenger pigeon; and
Whereas the story of the passenger pigeon, once a symbol of never-ending natural 
        abundance, and its subsequent extinction is unique in the annals of the 
        history of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate commemorates the importance of this 
centenary, our natural heritage, the sustainability of our ecosystem, 
and the balanced and responsible conservation of our Nation's wildlife.
                                 <all>
