                               RESOLUTION


 
Providing for completion of the accelerated transition of United States 
   combat and military and security operations to the Government of 
                              Afghanistan.

Whereas in June 2013, the Government of Afghanistan assumed the lead for combat 
        operations in all regions of Afghanistan consistent with the schedule 
        agreed to by President Barack Obama and President of Afghanistan Hamid 
        Karzai: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,

SECTION 1. COMPLETION OF ACCELERATED TRANSITION OF UNITED STATES COMBAT 
              AND MILITARY AND SECURITY OPERATIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF 
              AFGHANISTAN.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) that, in coordination with the Government of 
        Afghanistan, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member 
        countries, and other allies in Afghanistan, the President shall 
        complete the accelerated transition of United States military 
        and security operations to the Government of Afghanistan and 
        redeploy United States Armed Forces from Afghanistan (including 
        operations involving military and security-related contractors) 
        by not later than December 31, 2014; and
            (2) to pursue diplomatic efforts leading to a political 
        settlement and reconciliation of the internal conflict in 
        Afghanistan.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that, 
should the President determine the necessity to maintain United States 
troops in Afghanistan to carry out missions after December 31, 2014, 
any such presence and missions should be authorized by a separate vote 
of Congress not later than June 1, 2014.
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as limiting or prohibiting any authority of the President 
to--
            (1) modify the military strategy, tactics, and operations 
        of United States Armed Forces as such Armed Forces redeploy 
        from Afghanistan;
            (2) attack al Qaeda forces wherever such forces are 
        located;
            (3) provide financial support and equipment to the 
        Government of Afghanistan for the training and supply of 
        Afghanistan military and security forces;
            (4) gather, provide, and share intelligence with United 
        States allies operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan; or
            (5) provide security after December 31, 2014, to United 
        States facilities or diplomatic personnel located in 
        Afghanistan.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
