                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 10, 2013

   Mr. Isakson (for himself and Mr. Bennet) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing linemen, the profession of linemen, the contributions of 
  these brave men and women who protect public safety, and expressing 
  support for the designation of April 18, 2013, as National Lineman 
                           Appreciation Day.

Whereas the profession of linemen is steeped in personal, family, and 
        professional tradition;
Whereas linemen are often first responders during storms and other catastrophic 
        events, working to make the scene safe for other public safety heroes;
Whereas linemen work with thousands of volts of electricity high atop power 
        lines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to keep electricity flowing;
Whereas linemen must often work under dangerous conditions far from their 
        families to construct and maintain the energy infrastructure of the 
        United States;
Whereas linemen put their lives on the line every day with little recognition 
        from the community regarding the danger of their work; and
Whereas April 18, 2013, would be an appropriate date to designate as National 
        Lineman Appreciation Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the efforts of linemen in keeping the power 
        on and protecting public safety; and
            (2) supports the designation of April 18, 2013, as National 
        Lineman Appreciation Day.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
