                               RESOLUTION


 
Congratulating the Pennsylvania State University IFC/Panhellenic Dance 
  Marathon (``THON'') on its continued success in support of the Four 
        Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital.

Whereas the Pennsylvania State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon (referred to in 
        this preamble as ``THON'') is the largest student-run philanthropy in 
        the world, with 711 dancers, more than 375 supporting organizations, and 
        more than 15,000 volunteers involved in the annual event;
Whereas student volunteers at the Pennsylvania State University annually collect 
        money and dance for 46 hours straight at the Bryce Jordan Center as part 
        of THON, bringing energy and excitement to the campus for THON's mission 
        to conquer cancer and raise awareness about the disease;
Whereas all THON activities support the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey 
        Children's Hospital, which funds cancer research and provides financial 
        and emotional support to pediatric cancer patients and their families;
Whereas in each year since 1977, when the 2 organizations first became 
        affiliated, THON has been the single largest donor to the Four Diamonds 
        Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital;
Whereas THON has raised more than $113,000,000 in total for the Four Diamonds 
        Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital;
Whereas in 2014, THON set a new fundraising record of $13,343,517.33, besting 
        the previous record of $12,374,034.46, which was set in 2013;
Whereas THON has helped more than 3,300 families through the Four Diamonds Fund, 
        is helping to build a new Pediatric Cancer Pavilion at Penn State 
        Hershey Children's Hospital, and has supported life-saving pediatric 
        cancer research that has increased the survival rates for some pediatric 
        cancers to nearly 90 percent; and
Whereas THON has inspired similar events and organizations across the United 
        States, including at high schools and institutions of higher education, 
        and continues to encourage students across the United States to 
        volunteer and stay involved in great charitable causes in their 
        community: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Pennsylvania State University IFC/
        Panhellenic Dance Marathon (``THON'') on its continued success 
        in support of the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey 
        Children's Hospital; and
            (2) commends the Pennsylvania State University students, 
        volunteers, and supporting organizations for their hard work in 
        putting together another record-breaking THON.
                                 <all>
