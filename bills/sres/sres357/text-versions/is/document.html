                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing concern for undemocratic governance and the abuse of the 
                   rights of individuals in Ukraine.

Whereas the political crisis that has engulfed Ukraine reflects the people's 
        desire for a democratic state which rejects corruption and abides by the 
        rule of law;
Whereas Ukraine is a participating State of the Organization for Security and 
        Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and has made commitments to respect the 
        human rights of its citizens;
Whereas, in 2009, Ukraine joined the European Union's Eastern Partnership 
        initiative, pledging to uphold the shared values of democracy, the rule 
        of law, and respect for human rights;
Whereas the Government of Ukraine committed to judicial and electoral reforms to 
        align with those of the European Union in preparation for the signing of 
        an Association Agreement with the European Union;
Whereas, on Thursday, November 21, 2013, Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych 
        announced that Ukraine would not sign an Association Agreement with the 
        European Union, causing thousands of Ukrainians to assemble in Kiev's 
        Maidan Square in peaceful protest;
Whereas, on November 30 and December 11, 2013, Ukrainian paramilitary police 
        used excessive force against peaceful demonstrators in Kiev's Maidan 
        Square;
Whereas, on January 16, 2014, the parliament of Ukraine passed anti-protest 
        legislation restricting the right to peaceful assembly and the exercise 
        of free speech, constraining independent media, and inhibiting the 
        operation of nongovernmental organizations;
Whereas it is unclear whether these measures were passed legally, or have 
        subsequently been entirely repealed;
Whereas, on January 20, 2014, Freedom House stated it is ``deeply concerned by 
        Ukrainian authorities' targeted violence against journalists during 
        public protests in Kiev--demonstrations spurred by President Viktor 
        Yanukovych's signing into law measures that tightly limit public 
        protests, among other rollbacks on freedom'';
Whereas, on January 22, 2014, the actions of authorities in Ukraine resulted in 
        the death of two protestors, including one who was ``brutally beaten by 
        two riot police officers,'' according to Amnesty International;
Whereas, on January 30, 2014, Freedom House stated that ``at least five 
        Euromaidan activists are still reported missing, some since November 30, 
        2013 when anti-government demonstrations intensified'';
Whereas there are substantiated reports of kidnappings, including the abduction 
        and torture of opposition activist Dmitrii Bulatov, and evidence of 
        police brutality carried out against protesters and other activists, and 
        the Ukrainian nongovernmental organization EuroMaidan SOS claims that as 
        many as 27 people may be missing;
Whereas, on January 31, 2014, Human Rights Watch found that ``Ukrainian police 
        assaulted and injured dozens of journalists and medical workers while 
        trying to disperse street fighters and protesters in Kiev'' and called 
        upon the international community to ``press Ukraine to investigate 
        serious human rights violations and prosecute those responsible in 
        accordance with international due process standards'';
Whereas, on January 31, 2014, Freedom House reported that ``more than 40 
        journalists have been injured covering the demonstrations'' and that 
        ``[m]any of the reporters were attacked while wearing visible 
        identification of their status as journalists'';
Whereas the Government of Ukraine has continued to intimidate and use violence 
        against journalists and others expressing political opinions critical of 
        the current government; and
Whereas, on January 7, 2014, the United States Senate passed a resolution 
        expressing support for the people of Ukraine in light of public 
        resistance to President Yanukovych's decision not to sign an Association 
        Agreement with the European Union: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the President should increase democracy and human 
        rights programming in Ukraine to the extent possible;
            (2) the United States Government should immediately review 
        security assistance funding for any organization in Ukraine 
        involved in repressive efforts that violate the civil or human 
        rights of the people of Ukraine;
            (3) the United States Mission to the Organization for 
        Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) should utilize the 
        resources and mechanisms of the OSCE to monitor and address 
        human rights concerns, including the Office for Democratic 
        Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and Representative on 
        Freedom of Media (RFM);
            (4) the United States Representative to the United Nations 
        Human Rights Council should address Ukraine appropriately to 
        bodies such as the United Nations Human Rights Council;
            (5) the Department of State should immediately consider the 
        imposition of targeted sanctions, including visa bans and asset 
        freezes, against the perpetrators of state-sanctioned violence 
        in Ukraine against peaceful protesters, journalists, and other 
        members of civil society;
            (6) the United States Government should urge authorities in 
        Ukraine to locate missing persons and release all political 
        prisoners, including former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, 
        and hold perpetrators of extra-legal measures accountable;
            (7) the United States Government should work closely with 
        the European Union to strengthen and support its efforts in 
        Ukraine; and
            (8) the United States Government endorses the statement of 
        the European Union's Council on Foreign Affairs of February 10, 
        2014, which stated, ``A new and inclusive government, 
        constitutional reform bringing back more balance of powers, and 
        preparations for free and fair presidential elections would 
        contribute to bringing Ukraine back on a sustainable path of 
        reforms.''
