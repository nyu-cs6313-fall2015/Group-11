                Supporting women's reproductive health.

Whereas access to comprehensive reproductive health care is critical to 
        improving the health and well-being of women and their families;
Whereas access to affordable contraceptives and medically accurate information 
        prevents unintended pregnancies, thereby improving the health of women, 
        children, families, and society as a whole;
Whereas title X of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.) and the 
        Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
        1396 et seq.) cover health care and family planning services for 
        millions of women and men who do not have other insurance coverage, with 
        the Medicaid program alone covering 71 percent of publicly funded family 
        planning services and more than 40 percent of all births in the United 
        States;
Whereas women need access to comprehensive, affordable insurance that covers 
        family planning services, prenatal and postnatal care, miscarriage 
        management, labor and delivery services, and abortion; and
Whereas the lack of adequate prenatal care increases the risks of infant and 
        maternal mortality and preterm birth, which cost our health care system 
        approximately $26,000,000,000 annually: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports efforts to--
            (1) ensure that women have access to contraception, other 
        preventive services, and medically accurate information 
        necessary to make health care decisions;
            (2) ensure that the millions of women who rely on title X 
        of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.), the 
        Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 1396 et seq.), and non-profit providers like Planned 
        Parenthood continue to get cancer screenings, birth control, 
        and other essential health care services;
            (3) ensure that women have access to affordable insurance 
        coverage for all pregnancy-related health care needs; and
            (4) reduce health disparities between men and women and 
        among women of different races, ethnicities, and sexual 
        orientations.
                                 <all>
