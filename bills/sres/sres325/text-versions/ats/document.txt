                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           December 20, 2013

    Mr. Pryor (for himself and Mr. Boozman) submitted the following

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the week of December 22 through December 28, 2013, as 
                         ``National Toy Week''.

Whereas the goal of ``National Toy Week'' is to recognize toys as the ``tools of 
        play'', enriching the lives of young people for generations;
Whereas through play, children develop active minds, active bodies, and 
        necessary social skills;
Whereas National Toy Week encourages recognition of play as a universal pastime 
        that gives children of all ages the opportunity to spend time together 
        and have fun;
Whereas according to the Toy Industry Association, the toy industry supports 
        over 600,000 full-time jobs, accounting for more than $26,000,000,000 in 
        wages;
Whereas the toy industry is estimated to have an economic impact of over 
        $75,000,000,000 in 2013 alone; and
Whereas throughout the history of the toy industry, such industry has provided a 
        wealth of creativity and innovation across the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of December 22 through December 28, 
        2013, as ``National Toy Week'';
            (2) recognizes the necessary role of toys and play in the 
        development of children across the United States;
            (3) recognizes that, for 97 years, the toy industry has 
        promoted fun and safe play; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the week by enjoying toys and play.
