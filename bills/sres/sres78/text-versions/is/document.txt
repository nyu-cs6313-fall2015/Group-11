 Supporting the goals and ideals of Professional Social Work Month and 
                         World Social Work Day.

Whereas the social work profession has been instrumental in achieving advances 
        in civil and human rights in the United States and across the world for 
        more than a century;
Whereas the primary mission of social work is to enhance human well-being and 
        help meet the basic needs of all people, especially the people who are 
        most vulnerable;
Whereas the programs and services provided by professional social workers are 
        essential elements of the social safety net in the United States;
Whereas social workers have a critical impact on adolescent and youth 
        development, aging and family caregiving, child protection and family 
        services, health care navigation, mental and behavioral health 
        treatment, assistance to members and veterans of the Armed Forces, 
        nonprofit management and community development, and poverty reduction;
Whereas social workers function as specialists, consultants, private 
        practitioners, educators, community leaders, policymakers, and 
        researchers;
Whereas social workers influence many different organizations and human service 
        systems and are employed in a wide range of workplaces, including 
        private and public agencies, hospices and hospitals, schools, clinics, 
        businesses and corporations, military units, elected offices, think 
        tanks, and foundations;
Whereas social workers seek to improve social functioning and social conditions 
        for people in emotional, psychological, economic, or physical need;
Whereas social workers are experts in care coordination, case management, and 
        therapeutic treatment for biopsychosocial issues;
Whereas social workers have roles in more than 50 different fields of practice;
Whereas social workers believe that the strength of a country depends on the 
        ability of the majority of the people to lead productive and healthy 
        lives;
Whereas social workers help people, who are often navigating major life 
        challenges, find hope and new options for achieving their maximum 
        potential; and
Whereas social workers identify and address gaps in social systems that impede 
        full participation by individuals or groups in society: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Professional Social 
        Work Month and World Social Work Day;
            (2) acknowledges the diligent efforts of individuals and 
        groups who promote the importance of social work and observe 
        Professional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day;
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to engage in 
        appropriate ceremonies and activities to promote further 
        awareness of the life-changing role that social workers play; 
        and
            (4) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the 
        millions of caring individuals who have chosen to serve their 
        communities through social work.
                                 <all>
