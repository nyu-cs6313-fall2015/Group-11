                               RESOLUTION


 
  To authorize the production of records by the Committee on Homeland 
                   Security and Governmental Affairs.

Whereas, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs conducted a 
        review of disability claims adjudications made in the Social Security 
        Administration's Huntington, West Virginia Office of Disability 
        Adjudication and Review;
Whereas, the Committee has received a request from a federal agency for access 
        to records of the Committee's review;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate can, by administrative or judicial process, be 
        taken from such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate is needed for the promotion of justice, the Senate will take 
        such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, acting 
jointly, are authorized to provide to law enforcement officials, 
regulatory agencies, and other entities or individuals duly authorized 
by federal or state governments, records of the Committee's review of 
the disability claims adjudications made in the Social Security 
Administration's Huntington, West Virginia Office of Disability 
Adjudication and Review.
