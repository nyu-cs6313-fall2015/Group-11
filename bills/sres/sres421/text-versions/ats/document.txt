                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the gratitude and appreciation of the Senate for the acts of 
 heroism and military achievement by the members of the United States 
 Armed Forces who participated in the June 6, 1944, amphibious landing 
at Normandy, France, and commending them for leadership and valor in an 
          operation that helped bring an end to World War II.

Whereas June 6, 2014, marks the 70<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the Allied 
        assault at Normandy, France, by American, British, and Canadian troops, 
        which was known as Operation Overlord;
Whereas, before Operation Overlord, the German Army still occupied France and 
        the Nazi government still had access to the raw materials and industrial 
        capacity of Western Europe;
Whereas the naval assault phase on Normandy was codenamed ``Neptune'', and the 
        June 6<SUP>th</SUP> assault date is referred to as D-Day to denote the 
        day on which the combat attack was initiated;
Whereas the D-Day landing was the largest single amphibious assault in history, 
        consisting of approximately 31,000 members of the United States Armed 
        Forces, 153,000 members of the Allied Expeditionary Force, 5,000 naval 
        vessels, and more than 11,000 sorties by Allied aircraft;
Whereas soldiers of 6 divisions (3 American, 2 British, and 1 Canadian) stormed 
        ashore in 5 main landing areas on beaches in Normandy, which were code-
        named ``Utah'', ``Omaha'', ``Gold'', ``Juno'', and ``Sword'';
Whereas, of the approximately 10,000 Allied casualties incurred on the first day 
        of the landing, more than 6,000 casualties were members of the United 
        States Armed Forces;
Whereas the age of the remaining World War II veterans and the gradual 
        disappearance of any living memory of World War II and the Normandy 
        landings make it necessary to increase activities intended to pass on 
        the history of these events, particularly to younger generations;
Whereas the young people of Normandy and the United States have displayed 
        unprecedented commitment to and involvement in celebrating the veterans 
        of the Normandy landings and the freedom that they brought with them in 
        1944;
Whereas the significant material remains of the Normandy landing, such as 
        shipwrecks and various items of military equipment found both on the 
        Normandy beaches and at the bottom of the sea in French territorial 
        waters, bear witness to the remarkable material resources used by the 
        Allied Armed Forces to execute the Normandy landings;
Whereas 5 Normandy beaches and a number of sites on the Normandy coast, 
        including Pointe du Hoc, were the scene of the Normandy landings, and 
        constitute both now and for all time a unique piece of humanity's world 
        heritage, and a symbol of peace and freedom, whose unspoilt nature, 
        integrity, and authenticity must be protected at all costs; and
Whereas the world owes a debt of gratitude to the members of the ``greatest 
        generation'' who assumed the task of freeing the world from Nazi and 
        Fascist regimes and restoring liberty to Europe: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 70<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the 
        Allied amphibious landing on D-Day, June 6, 1944, at Normandy, 
        France, during World War II;
            (2) expresses gratitude and appreciation to the members of 
        the United States Armed Forces who participated in the D-Day 
        operations;
            (3) thanks the young people of Normandy and the United 
        States for their involvement in recognizing and celebrating the 
        70<SUP>th</SUP> Anniversary of the Normandy landings with the 
        aim of making future generations aware of the acts of heroism 
        and sacrifice performed by the Allied forces;
            (4) recognizes the efforts of the Government of France and 
        the people of Normandy to preserve, for future generations, the 
        unique world heritage represented by the Normandy beaches and 
        the sunken material remains of the Normandy landing, by 
        inscribing them on the United Nations Educational, Scientific, 
        and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List; and
            (5) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling 
        on the people of the United States to observe the anniversary 
        with appropriate ceremonies and programs to honor the 
        sacrifices of their fellow countrymen to liberate Europe.
                                 <all>
