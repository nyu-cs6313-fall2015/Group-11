                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the efforts of the National Park Service and others in 
            restoring and repairing the Washington Monument.

Whereas the employees of the National Park Service work tirelessly to maintain 
        the beauty of the 401 national parks of the United States, revitalize 
        communities, preserve local history, celebrate local heritage, and 
        create outdoor recreation for children and families;
Whereas the Washington Monument was built between 1848 and 1884 to commemorate 
        George Washington, the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during 
        the American Revolutionary War and the first President of the United 
        States;
Whereas the Washington Monument is a symbol of unity and freedom in the United 
        States and is the distinguishing feature of the skyline in Washington, 
        DC;
Whereas the Washington Monument is admired by more than 25,000,000 individuals 
        who visit The National Mall each year;
Whereas the Washington Monument was closed for over 2\1/2\ years for necessary 
        repairs after being damaged by an earthquake in 2011;
Whereas engineers examined each of the 9,040 marble stones on the exterior of 
        the Washington Monument and many of the more than 10,000 granite stones 
        on the interior of the monument to ensure that the repair of the 
        monument was sound and complete;
Whereas during the rehabilitation, the Washington Monument was covered with 
        scaffolding, markedly altering its appearance;
Whereas although the Washington Monument was closed during rehabilitation, the 
        488 lights on the scaffolding of the monument illuminated the night sky 
        of the United States capital and provided visitors and residents with a 
        sight of unexpected beauty; and
Whereas the repair of the Washington Monument would not have been possible 
        without the vision and dedication of the National Park Service, 
        contractors of the National Park Service, and generous philanthropic 
        support: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) pays tribute to the National Park Service, contractors 
        of the National Park Service, and all individuals who 
        contributed to the restoration of the Washington Monument; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to recognize 
        the hard work of the National Park Service in preserving the 
        monuments of the United States.
                                 <all>
