                               RESOLUTION


 
To authorize testimony, documents, and representation in United States 
                            v. Renzi, et al.

Whereas, in the case of United States v. Renzi, et al., Case No. 08-212, pending 
        in Arizona federal district court, the prosecution and defense have 
        requested the production of documents and employee testimony from the 
        offices of Senator John McCain and former Senator Jon Kyl;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Office of Senator John McCain and the former 
Office of Senator Jon Kyl are authorized to produce relevant documents 
and employee testimony in the case of United States v. Renzi, et al., 
except concerning matters for which a privilege should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
current and former employees of the offices of Senators McCain and Kyl 
in connection with the production of evidence authorized in section one 
of this resolution.
                                 <all>
