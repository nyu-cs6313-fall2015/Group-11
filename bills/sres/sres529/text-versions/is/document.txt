 Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of 
  the United States and commending its members for their courage and 
               sacrifice in service to the United States.

Whereas on September 17, 1914, members of the American Veterans of Foreign 
        Service and the National Society of the Army of the Philippines merged 
        their organizations and voted in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to adopt the 
        name ``Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States'';
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States remains active in 
        communities at the international, national, State, and local levels with 
        more than 2,000,000 members;
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States provides financial, 
        social, and emotional support to members of the Armed Forces, veterans, 
        and their dependents throughout the United States;
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States works on behalf of 
        servicemembers of the United States by calling on Congress for better 
        health care and benefits for veterans;
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States annually donates more 
        than 13,000,000 volunteer hours of community service; and
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States has played an 
        instrumental role in each significant veterans' legislation passed since 
        its founding and continues to play such a role: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the 
        United States on its 100th anniversary as a national 
        organization with a mission to--

                of overseas conflicts;
                    (B) serve veterans, the military, and communities 
                across the United States; and
                    (C) advocate on behalf of all veterans;
            (2) commends the members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of 
        the United States for their courage and sacrifice in service to 
        the United States; and
            (3) encourages all individuals of the United States to 
        express their appreciation for the honor, courage, and bravery
