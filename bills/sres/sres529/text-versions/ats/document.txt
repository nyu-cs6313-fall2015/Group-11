Whereas on September 17, 1914, members of the American Veterans of Foreign 
        Service and the National Society of the Army of the Philippines merged 
        their organizations and voted in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to adopt the 
        name ``Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States'';
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States remains active in 
        communities at the international, national, State, and local levels with 
        more than 2,000,000 members;
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States provides financial, 
        social, and emotional support to members of the Armed Forces, veterans, 
        and their dependents throughout the United States;
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States works on behalf of 
        servicemembers of the United States by calling on Congress for better 
        health care and benefits for veterans;
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States annually donates more 
        than 13,000,000 volunteer hours of community service; and
Whereas the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States has played an 
        instrumental role in each significant veterans' legislation passed since 
        its founding and continues to play such a role: Now, therefore, be it

                of overseas conflicts;
