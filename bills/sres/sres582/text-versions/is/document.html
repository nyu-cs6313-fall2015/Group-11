    Mr. Moran (for himself and Mr. Booker) submitted the following

                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of the third Tuesday of November as 
                    ``National Entrepreneurs Day''.

Whereas since the founding of the United States, innovation, creativity, 
        industriousness, and entrepreneurship have formed the economic fiber of 
        the United States;
Whereas entrepreneurs have long been vital to the economic health and growth of 
        the United States;
Whereas the willingness of entrepreneurs to assume risk has resulted in 
        unparalleled contributions to the growth and development of the United 
        States;
Whereas entrepreneurship is the stimulus for strengthening the economy, 
        advancing innovation, improving productivity, and creating new jobs;
Whereas research shows that innovation has been responsible for approximately 
        \2/3\ of the economic growth of the United States since World War II;
Whereas more than 500,000 new businesses are created in the United States every 
        month and small business openings have accounted for 40 percent of new 
        jobs in the last 20 years;
Whereas research shows that businesses 5 years or younger were responsible for 
        nearly every net new job in the economy of the United States between 
        1980 and 2005;
Whereas entrepreneurs and the businesses created by entrepreneurs are 
        responsible for roughly 3,000,000 jobs every year;
Whereas despite economic instability, 56 percent of adults were confident that 
        they could start a business and 82 percent of entrepreneurs in 2012 used 
        their own savings for startup cash, indicating that entrepreneurial 
        spirit remains strong in the United States;
Whereas collaboration and cooperation amidst a broad coalition of organizations, 
        including nonprofit entrepreneurial incubators, angel investors, venture 
        capitalists, crowd-funding initiatives, and other early-stage investors, 
        catalyze entrepreneurial ventures;
Whereas the Federal Government must continue to promote entrepreneurship in all 
        communities by ensuring that entrepreneurs find the necessary resources 
        to pursue their ideas;
Whereas support for entrepreneurs, including firms managed and owned by women 
        and other minorities, strengthens the overall economy of the United 
        States;
Whereas entrepreneurial literacy skills serve as one of the 21st-century content 
        areas critical to success in communities and workplaces;
Whereas more than 70 percent of young people in the United States envision 
        starting a business or pursuing an entrepreneurial endeavor as adults;
Whereas positive outcomes for youth who participate in entrepreneurship 
        education programs include improved academic performance, increased 
        critical thinking skills, and heightened occupational aspirations;
Whereas to maintain the position of the United States as a world economic 
        leader, government, entrepreneurs, institutions of higher education, and 
        businesses of all sizes must be united in a comprehensive effort to 
        welcome and cultivate entrepreneurial activities in the United States;
Whereas entrepreneurs face significant barriers that the Federal Government must 
        work to reduce so that all entrepreneurs in the United States have a 
        chance at success;
Whereas entrepreneurship is the best offense for economic progress and the 
        finest defense against the status quo for the United States; and
Whereas the third Tuesday of November would be an appropriate date to designate 
        as ``National Entrepreneurs Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Entrepreneurs 
        Day'';
            (2) recognizes the considerable contributions of 
        entrepreneurs to the United States; and
            (3) honors those entrepreneurs who ignite innovation and 
        inspire the next generation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
