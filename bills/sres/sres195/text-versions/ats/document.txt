                               RESOLUTION


 
To authorize testimony and representation In the Matter of the Proposed 
                    Discipline of Laura Block Lower.

Whereas, in the Matter of the Proposed Discipline of Laura Block Lower, Case No. 
        2012-SWP-LIC-445, pending before the Montana Board of Social Work 
        Examiners and Professional Counselors, the licensee has requested the 
        deposition of Siobhan Gilmartin, an employee in the state office of 
        Senator Jon Tester;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent employees of the Senate with respect to 
        any subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to their official 
        responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Siobhan Gilmartin is authorized to provide testimony 
in the Matter of the Proposed Discipline of Laura Block Lower, except 
concerning matters for which a privilege should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
Siobhan Gilmartin in connection with the production of testimony 
authorized in section one of this resolution.
                                 <all>
