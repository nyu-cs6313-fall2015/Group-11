                               RESOLUTION


 
   To authorize testimony, documents, and representation in City of 
                       Lafayette v. Bryan Benoit.

Whereas, in the case of City of Lafayette v. Bryan Benoit, Case No. CC201303991, 
        pending in City Court in Lafayette, Louisiana, the prosecution has 
        requested the production of testimony from two current employees in the 
        Lafayette, Louisiana office of Senator David Vitter, and one former 
        employee of that office;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent current and former employees of the 
        Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony 
        relating to their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Nicole Hebert and Kathy Manuel, current employees in 
the Office of Senator David Vitter, and Thomas Hebert, a former 
employee of that office, and any other employee of the Senator's office 
from whom relevant evidence may be necessary, are authorized to produce 
documents and provide testimony in the case of City of Lafayette v. 
Bryan Benoit, except concerning matters for which a privilege should be 
asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
current and former employees of Senator Vitter's office in connection 
with the production of evidence authorized in section one of this 
resolution.
                                 <all>
