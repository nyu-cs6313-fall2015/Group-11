                               RESOLUTION


 
Congratulating Indonesia's President-elect Joko Widodo on his electoral 
 victory and commending the people of Indonesia on their commitment to 
                 democracy and free and fair elections.

Whereas the United States and Indonesia are the world's second and third largest 
        democracies, respectively;
Whereas the United States and Indonesia share many common values, including 
        respect for human rights and the rule of law;
Whereas in November 2010, the United States and Indonesia launched the U.S.-
        Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership, which solidified a long-term 
        commitment to cooperation on key bilateral, regional and global issues;
Whereas the U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership's Democracy and Civil 
        Society Working Group promotes enhanced cooperation on parliamentary and 
        electoral processes and political empowerment for women;
Whereas Indonesia, a regional and global leader, has undergone a remarkable 
        democratic transformation over the last 2 decades;
Whereas on July 9, 2014, approximately 135,000,000 votes were cast in 
        Indonesia's Presidential election, which was the largest single day 
        election in the world to date;
Whereas on July 22, 2014, Joko Widodo was declared the winner in Indonesia's 
        Presidential election; and
Whereas Indonesia, with its vast geography, large multi-ethnic population, and 
        largest Muslim majority population in the world, is a powerful model for 
        a peaceful, democratic transition of power: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates Indonesia's President-elect Joko Widodo 
        on his electoral victory;
            (2) commends the people of Indonesia on their commitment to 
        democracy and free and fair elections;
            (3) affirms the commitment of the United States to 
        strengthening our bilateral relationship with Indonesia;
            (4) supports the advancement of an inclusive democracy and 
        an active role for civil society in Indonesia; and
            (5) recognizes Indonesia's 2014 Presidential election as an 
        example of a peaceful, democratic transition of power for other 
        transformational democracies throughout the world to follow.
                                 <all>
