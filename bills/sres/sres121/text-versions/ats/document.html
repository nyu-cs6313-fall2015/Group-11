                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of May 1, 2013, as ``Silver Star 
                         Service Banner Day''.

Whereas the Senate has always honored the sacrifices made by the wounded and ill 
        members of the Armed Forces;
Whereas the Silver Star Service Banner has come to represent the members of the 
        Armed Forces and veterans who were wounded or became ill in combat in 
        the wars fought by the United States;
Whereas the Silver Star Families of America was formed to help the American 
        people remember the sacrifices made by the wounded and ill members of 
        the Armed Forces by designing and manufacturing Silver Star Service 
        Banners and Silver Star Flags for that purpose;
Whereas the sole mission of the Silver Star Families of America is to evoke 
        memories of the sacrifices of members and veterans of the Armed Forces 
        on behalf of the United States through the presence of a Silver Star 
        Service Banner in a window or a Silver Star Flag flying;
Whereas the sacrifices of members and veterans of the Armed Forces on behalf of 
        the United States should never be forgotten; and
Whereas May 1, 2013, is an appropriate date to designate as ``Silver Star 
        Service Banner Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports the designation of May 1, 2013, 
as ``Silver Star Service Banner Day'' and calls upon the people of the 
United States to observe the day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
