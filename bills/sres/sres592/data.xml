  <summary>12/1/2014--Introduced.
Recognizes the contributions of the Montagnards who fought loyally and bravely with U.S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam War, and who continue to suffer persecution in Vietnam as a result of this relationship.

 Condemns actions taken by the government of Vietnam to suppress basic human rights and civil liberties for all its citizens.

Urges the President and Congress to develop policies that: (1) support Montagnards and other marginalized ethnic minority and indigenous populations such as the Khmer Krom and the Hmong in Vietnam, and (2) reflect U.S. interests and commitment to upholding human rights and democracy abroad.</summary>
