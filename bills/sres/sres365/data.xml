  <summary>3/12/2014--Passed Senate without amendment.
Reaffirms U.S. support for the people of Venezuela in their pursuit of representative democracy.

Deplores the use of force against peaceful demonstrators in Venezuela and the use of violence and politically-motivated criminal charges to intimidate the country's political opposition.

Calls on the government of Venezuela to: (1) dismantle the system of "colectivos'' and any other government-supported militias or vigilante groups; and (2) allow an impartial, third-party investigation into the use of force against peaceful demonstrations.

 Urges the President to impose targeted sanctions against individuals perpetrating human rights violations against peaceful demonstrators, journalists, and other members of civil society in Venezuela.

Calls for the United States to work with other countries in the hemisphere to encourage a process of dialogue between the government of Venezuela and the political opposition through the good offices of the Organization of American States (OAS).</summary>
