  To authorize testimony in writing, documents, and representation in 
                  Whitnum v. Town of Greenwich, et al.

Whereas, in the case of Whitnum v. Town of Greenwich, et al., Case No. 11-1402, 
        pending in Connecticut federal district court, the plaintiff has 
        requested the production of testimony and documents from Senator Richard 
        Blumenthal and the production of documents from the Senator's office;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent Members and employees of the Senate with 
        respect to any subpoena, order, or request for evidence relating to 
        their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rules VI and 
        XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or 
        in the possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative 
        process, be taken from such control or possession but by permission of 
        the Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Senator Richard Blumenthal is authorized to produce 
testimony in writing and relevant office documents in the case of 
Whitnum v. Town of Greenwich, et al., except concerning matters for 
which a privilege or objection should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent the 
Senator, his office, and any employee of the Senator's office from whom 
evidence may be sought, in connection with the production of evidence 
authorized in section one of this resolution.
                                 <all>
