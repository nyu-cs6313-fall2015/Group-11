                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Senate that the President should pursue 
   extradition authority for international cybercriminals committing 
          credit card theft targeting United States citizens.

Whereas the number of United States citizens who have had their identity and 
        financial information compromised as a result of recent data breaches at 
        major retailers exceeds 100,000,000;
Whereas the financial security of middle class Americans has been put at risk by 
        these criminal attacks;
Whereas cybercrimes targeting the financial information of United States 
        citizens are often transnational crimes; and
Whereas the United States does not currently have established extradition 
        agreements with many countries acting as safe havens for cybercriminals: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the President 
should immediately launch international negotiations with the 
governments of the world's leading powers for new, effective 
extradition treaties with countries with which the United States has no 
current extradition authority, as well as renegotiate old, ineffective 
treaties, in order to combat more effectively international 
cybercriminals, including those who target the credit card information 
of United States citizens.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
