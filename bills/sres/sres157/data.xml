  <summary>12/19/2013--Reported to Senate amended.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) all communications service providers must appropriately complete telephone calls to all areas of the United States regardless of the technology used by such providers; (2) no entity may unreasonably discriminate against communications service in rural areas; and (3) the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should pursue violators of FCC rules, impose enforcement actions to discourage uncompleted telephone calls and unreasonable discrimination, and establish a definitive solution to discrimination against communications service in rural areas.</summary>
