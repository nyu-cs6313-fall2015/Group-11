                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring the legacy and accomplishments of Jan Karski on the centennial 
                             of his birth.

Whereas Jan Karski was born on April 24, 1914, in Lodz, Poland;
Whereas Jan Karski managed to escape the Soviet massacre in the Katyn Forest in 
        1940, in which almost 22,000 Polish citizens lost their lives;
Whereas Jan Karski became a key emissary in the Polish underground resistance, 
        the Home Army, against Nazi occupation;
Whereas Jan Karski risked his own life after escaping a prisoner-of-war camp, 
        having endured Gestapo torture, to continue to act as an emissary for 
        the Polish Underground, in order to provide critical intelligence to the 
        Allied war effort and alert Allied governments about the Holocaust and 
        the dire situation on the ground in German-occupied Poland;
Whereas Jan Karski traveled to Allied capitals and provided critical eyewitness 
        testimony about the horrors of Hitler's ``Final Solution'' and the 
        extermination of Jews and others in Nazi-occupied Poland to British 
        Foreign Minister Anthony Eden and United States President Franklin 
        Roosevelt;
Whereas Jan Karski, after living through the atrocities of World War II, went on 
        to earn a Ph.D. from Georgetown University in 1952;
Whereas Jan Karski became a United States citizen and taught generations of 
        students of foreign policy at Georgetown University for 40 years, 
        dedicating the rest of his life to strengthening the idea of tolerance 
        and respect for different religions and cultures and ensuring that the 
        full extent of the Nazi atrocities are never forgotten; and
Whereas Jan Karski was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously on 
        May 29, 2012, one of the highest civilian honors in the United States: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the life and legacy of Dr. Jan Karski on the 
        centennial of his birth, and expresses its gratitude for his 
        efforts alerting the free world about the atrocities committed 
        by Nazi and totalitarian forces in occupied Poland during World 
        War II; and
            (2) applauds the awarding of the Presidential Medal of 
        Freedom to Jan Karski for his efforts during World War II and 
        reaffirms the importance of the United States-Poland bilateral 
        relationship.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
