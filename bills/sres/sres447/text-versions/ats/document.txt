                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the threats to freedom of the press and expression around 
  the world and reaffirming freedom of the press as a priority in the 
 efforts of the United States Government to promote democracy and good 
                              governance.

Whereas Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
        adopted at Paris December 10, 1948, states that ``everyone has the right 
        to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to 
        hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart 
        information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers'';
Whereas, in 1993, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed May 3 of each 
        year as ``World Press Freedom Day'' to celebrate the fundamental 
        principles of freedom of the press, to evaluate freedom of the press 
        around the world, to defend the media from attacks on its independence, 
        and to pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the 
        exercise of their profession;
Whereas, on December 18, 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a 
        resolution (A/RES/68/163) on the safety of journalists and the issue of 
        impunity, which unequivocally condemns all attacks and violence against 
        journalists and media workers, including torture, extrajudicial 
        killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, and intimidation 
        and harassment in both conflict and non-conflict situations;
Whereas 2014 is the 21st anniversary of World Press Freedom Day, which focuses 
        on the theme ``Media Freedom for a Better Future: Shaping the Post-2015 
        Development Agenda'';
Whereas the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act of 2009 (22 U.S.C. 2151 note; 
        Public Law 111-166), which was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate 
        and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, expanded the 
        examination of freedom of the press around the world in the annual human 
        rights report of the Department of State;
Whereas according to Reporters Without Borders, 71 journalists and 39 citizen 
        journalists were killed in 2013 in connection with their collection and 
        dissemination of news and information;
Whereas according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the 3 deadliest 
        countries for journalists on assignment in 2013 were Syria, Iraq, and 
        Egypt, and in Syria, the deadliest country for such journalists, an 
        unprecedented number of journalists were abducted;
Whereas according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 617 journalists have 
        been murdered since 1992 without the perpetrators of such crimes facing 
        punishment;
Whereas according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, the 5 countries with 
        the highest number of unpunished journalist murders between 2004 to 2013 
        are Iraq, Somalia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Syria;
Whereas according to Reporters Without Borders, 826 journalists and 127 citizen 
        journalists were arrested in 2013;
Whereas according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 211 journalists 
        worldwide were in prison on December 1, 2013;
Whereas according to Reporters Without Borders, the 5 countries with the highest 
        number of journalists in prison are Syria, China, Eritrea, Turkey, and 
        Iran;
Whereas according to Reporters Without Borders, the Government of Syria and 
        extremist rebel militias have intentionally targeted professional and 
        citizen journalists, causing dramatic repercussions for the freedom of 
        the press throughout the region;
Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has engaged in an unprecedented 
        campaign to silence the independent press and undermine freedom of 
        expression, including its recent efforts to destabilize Ukraine;
Whereas Reporters Without Borders has expressed concern that journalists in Cuba 
        have suffered physical attacks, arbitrary detention, and death threats, 
        and have been prevented access to information;
Whereas Freedom House has cited a deteriorating environment for internet freedom 
        around the world and has ranked Iran, Cuba, China, Syria, and Ethiopia 
        as having the worst obstacles to access, limits on content, and 
        violations of user rights among the countries and territories rated by 
        Freedom House as ``Not Free'';
Whereas freedom of the press is a key component of democratic governance, the 
        activism of civil society, and socioeconomic development; and
Whereas freedom of the press enhances public accountability, transparency, and 
        participation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses concern about the threats to freedom of the 
        press and expression around the world following World Press 
        Freedom Day, held on May 3, 2014;
            (2) commends journalists and media workers around the world 
        for their essential role in promoting government 
        accountability, defending democratic activity, and 
        strengthening civil society, despite threats to their safety;
            (3) pays tribute to the journalists who have lost their 
        lives carrying out their work;
            (4) calls on governments abroad to implement United Nations 
        General Assembly Resolution (A/RES/68/163), by thoroughly 
        investigating and seeking to resolve outstanding cases of 
        violence against journalists, including murders and 
        kidnappings, while ensuring the protection of witnesses;
            (5) condemns all actions around the world that suppress 
        freedom of the press, such as the recent kidnappings of 
        journalists and media workers in eastern Ukraine by pro-Russian 
        militant groups;
            (6) reaffirms the centrality of freedom of the press to 
        efforts by the United States Government to support democracy, 
        mitigate conflict, and promote good governance domestically and 
        around the world; and
            (7) calls on the President and the Secretary of State--
                    (A) to ensure that the United States Government 
                rapidly identifies, publicizes, and responds to threats 
                against freedom of the press around the world;
                    (B) to continue to urge foreign governments to 
                transparently investigate and bring to justice the 
                perpetrators of attacks against journalists; and
                    (C) to continue to highlight the issue of threats 
                against freedom of the press year-round.
                                 <all>
