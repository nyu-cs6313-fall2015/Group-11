      Designating July 26, 2014, as ``United States Intelligence 
                          Professionals Day''.

Whereas, on July 26, 1908, Attorney General Charles Bonaparte ordered newly 
        hired Federal investigators to report to the Office of the Chief 
        Examiner of the Department of Justice, which subsequently was renamed 
        the Federal Bureau of Investigation;
Whereas, on July 26, 1947, President Truman signed the National Security Act of 
        1947 (50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), creating the Department of Defense, the 
        National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the 
        Joint Chiefs of Staff, thereby laying the foundation for today's 
        intelligence community;
Whereas the National Security Act of 1947, which appears in title 50 of the 
        United States Code, governs the definition, composition, 
        responsibilities, authorities, and oversight of the intelligence 
        community of the United States;
Whereas the intelligence community is defined by section 3(4) of the National 
        Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4)) to include the Office of the 
        Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the 
        National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National 
        Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, 
        other offices within the Department of Defense for the collection of 
        specialized national intelligence through reconnaissance programs, the 
        intelligence elements of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine 
        Corps, the Coast Guard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug 
        Enforcement Administration, and the Department of Energy, the Bureau of 
        Intelligence and Research of the Department of State, the Office of 
        Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of the Treasury, the 
        elements of the Department of Homeland Security concerned with the 
        analysis of intelligence information, and other elements as may be 
        designated;
Whereas July 26, 2012, was the 65th anniversary of the signing of the National 
        Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);
Whereas the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 
        108-458; 118 Stat. 3638) created the position of the Director of 
        National Intelligence to serve as the head of the intelligence community 
        and to ensure that national intelligence be timely, objective, 
        independent of political considerations, and based upon all sources 
        available;
Whereas Congress has previously passed joint resolutions, signed by the 
        President, to designate Peace Officers Memorial Day on May 15, Patriot 
        Day on September 11, and other commemorative occasions, to honor the 
        sacrifices of law enforcement officers and of those who lost their lives 
        on September 11, 2001;
Whereas the United States has increasingly relied upon the men and women of the 
        intelligence community to protect and defend the security of the United 
        States in the decade since the attacks of September 11, 2001;
Whereas the men and women of the intelligence community, both civilian and 
        military, have been increasingly called upon to deploy to theaters of 
        war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere since September 11, 2001;
Whereas numerous intelligence officers of the elements of the intelligence 
        community have been injured or killed in the line of duty;
Whereas intelligence officers of the United States are routinely called upon to 
        accept personal hardship and sacrifice in the furtherance of their 
        mission to protect the United States, to undertake dangerous assignments 
        in the defense of the interests of the United States, to collect 
        reliable information within prescribed legal authorities upon which the 
        leaders of the United States rely in life-and-death situations, and to 
        ``speak truth to power'' by providing their best assessments to 
        decisionmakers, regardless of political and policy considerations;
Whereas the men and women of the intelligence community have on numerous 
        occasions succeeded in preventing attacks upon the United States and 
        allies of the United States, saving numerous innocent lives; and
Whereas intelligence officers of the United States must of necessity often 
        remain unknown and unrecognized for their substantial achievements and 
        successes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates July 26, 2014, as ``United States 
        Intelligence Professionals Day'';
            (2) acknowledges the courage, fidelity, sacrifice, and 
        professionalism of the men and women of the intelligence 
        community of the United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
