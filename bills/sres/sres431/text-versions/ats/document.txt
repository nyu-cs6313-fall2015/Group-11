                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring military children during the National Month of the Military 
                                 Child.

Whereas more than 2,200,000 individuals demonstrate courage and commitment to 
        freedom by serving in the Armed Forces of the United States;
Whereas 43.5 percent of members of the Armed Forces, when deployed away from 
        their permanent duty stations, leave behind families with children;
Whereas no one feels the effect of deployments more than the children of 
        deployed members of the Armed Forces;
Whereas as of March 2014, more than 52,000 children have had a military parent 
        wounded in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom;
Whereas the daily struggles and personal sacrifices of children of members of 
        the Armed Forces are too often unnoticed;
Whereas countless children live with a parent who is a member of the Armed 
        Forces and who bears a visible or invisible wound of war;
Whereas the children of members of the Armed Forces are a source of pride and 
        honor to the people of the United States, and it is fitting that the 
        United States recognize the contributions of such children and celebrate 
        the spirit of such children;
Whereas the National Month of the Military Child, observed in April of each 
        year, recognizes military children for their sacrifices and contributes 
        to demonstrating the unconditional support of the United States for 
        members of the Armed Forces;
Whereas in addition to programs of the Department of Defense to support military 
        families and military children, various programs and campaigns have been 
        established in the private sector to honor, support, and thank military 
        children by fostering awareness and appreciation for the sacrifices and 
        the challenges that such children face; and
Whereas a month-long salute to military children encourages support for the 
        organizations and campaigns established to provide direct support for 
        military children and families: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) joins the Secretary of Defense in honoring the children 
        of members of the Armed Forces and recognizes that such 
        children share in the burden of protecting the United States; 
        and
            (2) urges the people of the United States to join the 
        military community in observing the National Month of the 
        Military Child with appropriate ceremonies and activities that 
        honor, support, and thank military children.
                                 <all>
