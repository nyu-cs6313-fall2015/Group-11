                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the significance of May 2014 as Asian/Pacific American 
   Heritage Month as an important time to celebrate the significant 
 contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to the history 
                         of the United States.

Whereas the United States joins together each May to pay tribute to the 
        contributions of generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
        who have enriched the history of the United States;
Whereas the history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United 
        States is inextricably tied to the story of the United States;
Whereas the Asian American and Pacific Islander community is an inherently 
        diverse population comprised of more than 45 distinct ethnicities and 
        more than 100 language dialects;
Whereas, according to the Bureau of the Census, the Asian American population 
        grew faster than any other racial or ethnic group in the United States 
        during the last decade, surging nearly 46 percent between 2000 and 2010, 
        which is a growth rate 4 times faster than that of the total population 
        of the United States;
Whereas the 2010 decennial census estimated that there are approximately 
        17,300,000 residents of the United States who identify as Asian and 
        approximately 1,200,000 residents of the United States who identify 
        themselves as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, making up 
        approximately 5.5 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, of the total 
        population of the United States;
Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month 
        because the first immigrants from Japan arrived in the United States on 
        May 7, 1843, and the first transcontinental railroad was completed on 
        May 10, 1869, with substantial contributions from immigrants from China;
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, officially designates May 
        as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month and requests the President to 
        issue an annual proclamation calling on the people of the United States 
        to observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
        activities;
Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, such as Daniel K. Inouye, a Medal 
        of Honor and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient who, as President 
        Pro Tempore of the Senate, was the highest-ranking Asian American 
        government official in United States history, Dalip Singh Saund, the 
        first Asian American Congressman, Patsy T. Mink, the first woman of 
        color and Asian American woman to be elected to Congress, Hiram L. Fong, 
        the first Asian American Senator, and others have made significant 
        contributions in both our government and our military, including the 
        first Asian American cabinet member in 2000 and the first female Asian 
        American cabinet member in 2001;
Whereas the year 2014 marks several important milestones for the Asian American 
        and Pacific Islander community, including--

    (1) the 15&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; anniversary of the establishment of the White 
House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders under Executive 
Order 13125 by President William J. Clinton;

    (2) the 20&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; anniversary of the founding of the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a bicameral caucus of Members 
of Congress advocating on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders; 
and

    (3) the 20&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; anniversary of the creation of the Asian 
Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies;

Whereas in 2014, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a bicameral 
        caucus of Members of Congress advocating on behalf of Asian Americans 
        and Pacific Islanders, is composed of 41 Members, including 13 Members 
        of Asian or Pacific Islander descent;
Whereas in 2014, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are serving in State 
        legislatures across the United States in record numbers, including in 
        the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Colorado, 
        Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, 
        New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington;
Whereas the number of Federal judges who are Asian Americans or Pacific 
        Islanders doubled between 2001 and 2008 and more than tripled between 
        2009 and 2014, reflecting a commitment to diversity in the Federal 
        judiciary that has resulted in the confirmations of high caliber Asian 
        American and Pacific Islander judicial nominees;
Whereas there remains much to be done to ensure that Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders have access to resources and a voice in the Government of the 
        United States and continue to advance in the political landscape of the 
        United States; and
Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month provides the people of 
        the United States with an opportunity to recognize the achievements, 
        contributions, and history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and 
        to appreciate the challenges faced by Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the significance of May 2014 as Asian/
        Pacific American Heritage Month as an important time to 
        celebrate the significant contributions of Asian Americans and 
        Pacific Islanders to the history of the United States; and
            (2) recognizes that the Asian American and Pacific Islander 
        community enhances the rich diversity of and strengthens the 
        United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
