                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           November 12, 2013

 Mr. Cardin (for himself, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs.

      the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the 75&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; anniversary of Kristallnacht, or the 
                         Night of Broken Glass.

Whereas November 9, 2013, through November 10, 2013, marks the 75&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; 
        anniversary of Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass;
Whereas Kristallnacht began as a pogrom authorized by Nazi party officials and 
        carried out by members of the Sturmabteilungen (SA), Schutzstaffel (SS), 
        and Hitler Youth, marking the Nazi party's first large-scale anti-
        Semitic operation and a crucial turning point in Nazi anti-Semitic 
        policy;
Whereas, during Kristallnacht, synagogues, homes, and businesses in Jewish 
        communities were attacked, resulting in murders and arrests of Jewish 
        people in Germany and in Austrian and Czechoslovakian territories 
        controlled by the Nazis;
Whereas the events of Kristallnacht resulted in the burning and destruction of 
        267 synagogues, the looting of thousands of businesses and homes, the 
        desecration of Jewish cemeteries, the murder of 91 Jews, and the arrest 
        and deportation of 30,000 Jewish men to concentration camps;
Whereas the shards of broken glass from the windows of synagogues, Jewish homes, 
        and Jewish-owned businesses ransacked during the violence that littered 
        the streets gave the pogrom its name: Kristallnacht, commonly translated 
        as the ``Night of Broken Glass'';
Whereas Kristallnacht proved to be a crucial turning point in the Holocaust, 
        marking a shift from a policy of removing Jews from Germany and German-
        occupied lands to murdering millions of people, and was a tragic 
        precursor to the Second World War;
Whereas, despite numerous global efforts to eradicate hate, manifestations of 
        anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance continue to harm our 
        societies on a global scale; and
Whereas Kristallnacht teaches us how hate can proliferate and erode our 
        societies and serves as a reminder that we must advance global efforts 
        to ensure such barbarism and mass murder never occur again: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 75&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; anniversary of 
        Kristallnacht;
            (2) pays tribute to the over 6,000,000 Jewish people killed 
        during the Holocaust and the families affected by the tragedy;
            (3) continues to support United States efforts to address 
        the horrible legacy of the Holocaust and combat manifestations 
        of anti-Semitism domestically and globally;
            (4) will continue to raise awareness and act to eradicate 
        the continuing scourge of anti-Semitism at home and abroad, 
        including through work with international partners such as the 
        Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Personal 
        Representative on Combating Anti-Semitism and Tolerance and 
        Non-Discrimination Unit; and
            (5) requests that the Secretary of the Senate prepare an 
        enrolled version of this resolution for presentation to the 
        United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
