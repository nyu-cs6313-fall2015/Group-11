                            October 4, 2013

 Mr. Rockefeller (for himself, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Levin) submitted

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week of October 7 through 13, 2013, as ``National Chess 
Week'' to enhance awareness and encourage students and adults to engage 
   in a game known to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving 
                                skills.

Whereas there are more than 80,000 members of the United States Chess Federation 
        (referred to in this preamble as the ``Federation''), and unknown 
        numbers of additional people in the United States who play chess without 
        joining an official organization;
Whereas approximately \1/2\ of the members of the Federation are members of 
        scholastic chess programs;
Whereas many studies have linked scholastic chess programs to the improvement of 
        students' scores in reading and math, as well as improved self-esteem;
Whereas the Federation offers guidance to educators to help incorporate chess 
        into the school curriculum;
Whereas chess is a powerful cognitive learning tool that can be used to 
        successfully enhance students' reading skills and understanding of math 
        concepts, as well as to improve memory function for people of all ages;
Whereas chess also offers educational and social activity benefits to adults and 
        is used in programs to help stroke victims and people suffering from 
        post-traumatic stress disorder; and
Whereas the Federation offers programs for adults including senior citizens, 
        members of the Armed Forces, and veterans: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of October 7 through 13, 2013, as 
        ``National Chess Week'' to enhance awareness and encourage 
        students and adults to play chess, a game known to enhance 
        critical-thinking and problem-solving skills for students of 
        all ages, learning abilities, and strengths; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Chess Week with appropriate programs and activities.
                                 <all>
