                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the 50th anniversary of ``Smoking and Health: Report of the 
 Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States'' and 
   the significant progress in reducing the public health burden of 
    tobacco use, and supporting an end to tobacco-related death and 
                                disease.

Whereas ``Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon 
        General of the United States'' (referred to in this preamble as the 
        ``1964 Report of the Surgeon General on Smoking and Health'') was the 
        first Surgeon General of the United States report to definitively link 
        smoking with lung cancer and heart disease;
Whereas the 1964 Report of the Surgeon General on Smoking and Health paved the 
        way for a series of important public health initiatives aimed at 
        reducing the burden of tobacco use, including the addition of health 
        warnings to cigarette packages, bans on cigarette advertising in the 
        broadcast media, and the removal of fruit flavoring that appeal to 
        children from cigarettes;
Whereas tobacco control policies and public health initiatives aimed at curbing 
        tobacco use contributed to a decrease in the prevalence of smoking by 
        people of the United States from 42 percent in 1965 to 18 percent in 
        2012;
Whereas tobacco use remains one of the most pressing public health concerns of 
        the United States and is the leading preventable cause of disease, 
        disability, and death in the United States;
Whereas tobacco use causes 18 types of cancer, heart disease, chronic 
        obstructive pulmonary disease, pregnancy complications, and a host of 
        other diseases and conditions;
Whereas in January of 2014, more than 43,000,000 adults of the United States 
        smoke, more than 8,000,000 of such adults live with a serious illness 
        caused by smoking, and more than 440,000 people of the United States die 
        prematurely each year as a result of tobacco use;
Whereas most tobacco users begin smoking as children, every day more than 3,000 
        children try a cigarette for the first time, 700 children become daily 
        smokers, and \1/3\ of such children are projected to die prematurely as 
        a result of tobacco use; and
Whereas smoking exacts a $193,000,000,000 toll on the economy of the United 
        States each year, including $96,000,000,000 in direct medical costs and 
        $97,000,000,000 in lost productivity: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the 50th anniversary of ``Smoking and 
        Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General 
        of the United States'' and the significant contributions of 
        such report in reducing the public health burden of tobacco 
        use; and
            (2) supports ending tobacco-related death and disease.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
