Whereas the United States carried out its first combat mission in Vietnam on 
        January 12, 1962;

        era, including 4,368,000 in the United States Army, 1,842,000 in the 
        United States Navy, 794,000 in the United States Marine Corps, and 
        1,740,000 in the United States Air Force;

        Vietnam War, of whom 1,645 are still unaccounted for;
Whereas 725 United States servicemembers were taken as prisoners of war, with 64 
        dying while in internment;
Whereas the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973, put an end to the 
        direct intervention of the United States in the Vietnam War; and
Whereas the last United States combat troops left South Vietnam 2 months later 
        in the spring of 1973: Now, therefore, be it
