                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating and honoring the dedication and sacrifice of the Federal, 
   State, and local law enforcement officers who have been killed or 
                      injured in the line of duty.

Whereas the well-being of all individuals in the United States is preserved and 
        enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance and dedication of law 
        enforcement officers;
Whereas more than 900,000 law enforcement officers greatly risk their personal 
        safety to serve individuals in the United States as guardians of the 
        peace;
Whereas law enforcement officers are often on the front lines in protecting the 
        schools and school children in the United States;
Whereas, in 2013, 101 law enforcement officers across the United States were 
        killed in the line of duty;
Whereas Congress should strongly support initiatives to reduce violent crime and 
        contribute to the safety of law enforcement officers, including--

    (1) providing such officers with equipment of the highest quality and 
modernity;

    (2) increasing the availability and use of bullet-resistant vests for 
such officers;

    (3) improving training for such officers; and

    (4) providing advanced emergency medical care for such officers;

Whereas more than 19,000 Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers lost 
        their lives in the line of duty while protecting citizens of the United 
        States, and the names of such officers are engraved on the National Law 
        Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, DC;
Whereas, in 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15 as ``National 
        Peace Officers Memorial Day''; and
Whereas, on May 15, 2014, more than 20,000 law enforcement officers are expected 
        to gather in Washington, DC, to join the families of their fallen 
        comrades to honor those comrades and all law enforcement officers who 
        have fallen before them: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates and acknowledges the dedication and 
        sacrifices of the Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
        officers who have been killed or injured in the line of duty;
            (2) recognizes May 15, 2014, as ``National Peace Officers 
        Memorial Day''; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        that day with appropriate ceremonies, solemnity, appreciation, 
        and respect.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
