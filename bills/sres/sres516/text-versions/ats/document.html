                               RESOLUTION


 
  To authorize testimony, document production, and representation in 
                State of North Dakota v. Beatrice Quill.

Whereas, in the case of State of North Dakota v. Beatrice Quill, Crim. No. 08-
        2014-CR-01545, pending in South Central Judicial District Court in 
        Bismarck, North Dakota, the prosecution has requested the production of 
        testimony from two employees in the Bismarck, North Dakota office of 
        Senator Heidi Heitkamp, and a video recording from that office;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent current or former employees of the 
        Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony 
        relating to their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Megan Carranza and Jane Opdahl, employees in the 
Office of Senator Heidi Heitkamp, and any other current or former 
employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant evidence may be 
necessary, are authorized to produce documents and provide testimony in 
the case of State of North Dakota v. Beatrice Quill, except concerning 
matters for which a privilege should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
employees of Senator Heitkamp's office in connection with the 
production of evidence authorized in section one of this resolution.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
