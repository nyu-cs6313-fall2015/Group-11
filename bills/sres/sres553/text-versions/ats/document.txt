  Recognizing the 250th anniversary of the Hartford Courant newspaper.

Whereas the first edition of the Hartford Courant was printed on October 29, 
        1764;
Whereas the Hartford Courant is the oldest continuously published newspaper in 
        the United States;
Whereas the Hartford Courant gave voice to a newfound yearning for freedom as 
        the most circulated newspaper in the colonies during the throes of the 
        Revolutionary War;
Whereas the Hartford Courant demonstrated leadership in actively supporting the 
        presidential efforts of President Abraham Lincoln and his attempts to 
        end slavery during the Civil War; and
Whereas the Hartford Courant is a 5-time finalist and 2-time winner of the 
        Pulitzer Prize for journalistic excellence: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the significant and positive impact of the 
        Hartford Courant throughout the history of the United States; 
        and
            (2) acknowledges the importance of a vibrant free press to 
        democracy.
