                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 6, 2013

    Mr. Casey (for himself and Mr. Toomey) submitted the following 
    resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Congratulating the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon on its 
 continued success in support of the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State 
                      Hershey Children's Hospital.

Whereas the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon (commonly referred to as 
        ``THON'') is the largest student-run philanthropy in the world, with 710 
        dancers, more than 15,000 volunteers, and more than 300 supporting 
        organizations involved in the annual event;
Whereas student volunteers at the Pennsylvania State University annually raise 
        money and dance for 46 consecutive hours at the Bryce Jordan Center, 
        bringing energy and excitement to the Pennsylvania State University 
        campus for the mission of conquering pediatric cancer and promoting 
        awareness of the disease to thousands of individuals;
Whereas all THON activities support the mission of the Four Diamonds Fund at 
        Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, which provides financial and 
        emotional support to pediatric cancer patients and their families and 
        funds research on pediatric cancer;
Whereas THON is the largest donor to the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State 
        Hershey Children's Hospital each year, having raised more than 
        $100,000,000 since 1977, when the 2 organizations first partnered;
Whereas, in 2013, THON set a new fundraising record of $12,374,034.46, 
        surpassing the previous record of $10,686,924.83, set in 2012;
Whereas THON--

    (1) has helped more than 2,000 families through the Four Diamonds Fund;

    (2) is helping to build a new Pediatric Cancer Pavilion at Penn State 
Hershey Children's Hospital; and

    (3) has supported pediatric cancer research that has caused some 
pediatric cancer survival rates to increase to nearly 90 percent; and

Whereas THON has inspired similar organizations and events across the United 
        States, including at high schools and institutions of higher education, 
        and continues to encourage students across the United States to 
        volunteer and remain involved in great charitable causes in their 
        communities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance 
        Marathon (commonly referred to as ``THON'') on its continued 
        success in support of the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State 
        Hershey Children's Hospital; and
            (2) commends the Pennsylvania State University students, 
        volunteers, and supporting organizations for their hard work in 
        organizing another recordbreaking THON.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
