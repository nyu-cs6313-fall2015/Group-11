_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating the week of October 27 through November 2, 2014, as 
   ``National Drug Take-Back Week'', and designating October 2014 as 
   ``National Prescription Opioid and Heroin Abuse Awareness Month''.

Whereas prescription opioids can play an integral role in proper pain management 
        and treatment of health conditions;
Whereas when no longer needed or wanted for legitimate pain management or health 
        treatment, prescription opioids are susceptible to diversion;
Whereas prescription opioids may be abused by individuals who were not 
        prescribed such drugs or misused by individuals not taking such drugs as 
        directed;
Whereas prescription opioid pain relievers are powerful, regulated drugs that, 
        according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, attach to the same 
        cell receptors as heroin;
Whereas prescription opioids, when used improperly or not taken as prescribed, 
        can be addictive;
Whereas scientific studies indicate a link between prescription opioid abuse and 
        potential future heroin use and addiction;
Whereas compared to prescription opioids, heroin is a cheaper drug and becoming 
        more readily available;
Whereas deaths from heroin overdoses have significantly increased in communities 
        across the United States;
Whereas addiction and overdoses take lives, ruin families, and fuel rising crime 
        rates in communities across the United States;
Whereas drug take-back programs allow for the collection and safe disposal of 
        unwanted or unused drugs; and
Whereas drug take-back days are held infrequently: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) encourages a continuous national dialogue on efforts to 
        combat prescription opioid abuse and heroin addiction;
            (2) supports a holistic approach to addressing prescription 
        opioid and heroin abuse, including through law enforcement and 
        first responder initiatives, international drug interdiction, 
        and treatment, recovery, prevention, and education efforts;
            (3) recognizes the commitment of Federal, State, and local 
        law enforcement personnel, first responders, firefighters, 
        treatment providers, researchers, prescribers, pharmacists, 
        dispensers, medical boards, manufacturers, and community 
        organizations to addressing prescription opioid abuse and 
        heroin addiction;
            (4) supports the goals of drug take-back efforts by the 
        Drug Enforcement Administration and the State, local, and 
        tribal law enforcement partners of the Drug Enforcement 
        Administration, and encourages the expansion of such efforts;
            (5) designates the week of October 27 through November 2, 
        2014, as ``National Drug Take-Back Week'';
            (6) encourages media organizations to bring awareness to 
        prescription opioid and heroin use, particularly among the 
        youth in the United States; and
            (7) designates October 2014 as ``National Prescription 
        Opioid and Heroin Abuse Awareness Month''.
