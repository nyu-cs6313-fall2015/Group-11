                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating the week of September 23 through September 29, 2013, as 
                      ``National Estuaries Week''.

Whereas the estuary regions of the United States constitute a significant share 
        of the economy of the United States, with as much as 41 percent of the 
        gross domestic product of the United States generated in coastal 
        shoreline counties;
Whereas the population of coastal shoreline counties in the United States 
        increased by 39 percent from 1970 to 2010 and is projected to continue 
        to increase;
Whereas not less than 1,900,000 jobs in the United States are supported by 
        marine tourism and recreation and other coastal industries that rely on 
        healthy estuaries;
Whereas the commercial and recreational fishing industries rely on healthy 
        estuaries and directly support 1,700,000 jobs in the United States;
Whereas, in 2011, commercial fish landings generated $5,300,000,000 and 
        recreational anglers spent $26,780,000,000;
Whereas estuaries provide vital habitats for countless species of fish and 
        wildlife, including many species that are listed as threatened or 
        endangered species;
Whereas estuaries provide critical ecosystem services that protect human health 
        and public safety, including water filtration, flood control, shoreline 
        stabilization, erosion prevention, and the protection of coastal 
        communities during extreme weather events;
Whereas the United States has lost more than 110,000,000 acres of wetland, or 50 
        percent of the wetland of the United States, since the first European 
        settlers arrived;
Whereas bays in the United States that were once filled with fish and oysters 
        have become dead zones filled with excess nutrients, chemical wastes, 
        harmful algae, and marine debris;
Whereas changes in sea level can affect estuarine water quality and estuarine 
        habitats;
Whereas the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) 
        provides that it is the policy of the United States to preserve, 
        protect, develop, and, if possible, restore or enhance the resources of 
        the coastal zone of the United States, including estuaries, for current 
        and future generations;
Whereas 24 coastal and Great Lakes States and territories of the United States 
        operate a National Estuary Program or contain a National Estuarine 
        Research Reserve;
Whereas scientific study leads to better understanding of the benefits of 
        estuaries to human and ecological communities;
Whereas the Federal Government, State, local, and tribal governments, national 
        and community organizations, and individuals work together to 
        effectively manage the estuaries of the United States;
Whereas estuary restoration efforts restore natural infrastructure in local 
        communities in a cost-effective manner, helping to create jobs and 
        reestablish the natural functions of estuaries that yield countless 
        benefits; and
Whereas the week of September 23 through September 29, 2013, has been recognized 
        as ``National Estuaries Week'' to increase awareness among all people of 
        the United States, including Federal Government and State and local 
        government officials, about the importance of healthy estuaries and the 
        need to protect and restore estuaries: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of September 23 through September 
        29, 2013, as ``National Estuaries Week'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Estuaries 
        Week;
            (3) acknowledges the importance of estuaries to sustaining 
        employment in the United States and the economic well-being and 
        prosperity of the United States;
            (4) recognizes that persistent threats undermine the health 
        of the estuaries of the United States;
            (5) applauds the work of national and community 
        organizations and public partners that promote public 
        awareness, understanding, protection, and restoration of 
        estuaries;
            (6) reaffirms the support of the Senate for estuaries, 
        including the scientific study, preservation, protection, and 
        restoration of estuaries; and
            (7) expresses the intent of the Senate to continue working 
        to understand, protect, and restore the estuaries of the United 
        States.
                                 <all>
