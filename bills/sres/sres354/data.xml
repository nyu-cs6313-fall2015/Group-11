  <summary>2/11/2014--Introduced.
Expresses the Senate's belief that the United States: (1) should undertake every reasonable effort to find and repatriate members of the Armed Forces who are missing and to repatriate members who are captured; (2) has a responsibility to keep the promises made to members of the Armed Forces who risk their lives on behalf of the people of the United States; and (3) while continuing to transition leadership roles in combat operations in Afghanistan to the people of Afghanistan, must continue fulfilling the promises made to members in a missing status or captured as a result of service in Afghanistan.

Expresses support for the U.S. Soldier's Creed and the Warrior Ethos, which state that "I will never leave a fallen comrade."</summary>
