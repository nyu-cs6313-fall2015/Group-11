                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating December 14, 2013, as ``Wreaths Across America Day''.

Whereas 22 years ago, the Wreaths Across America project began an annual 
        tradition, during the month of December, of donating, transporting, and 
        placing Maine balsam fir holiday wreaths on the graves of the fallen 
        heroes buried at Arlington National Cemetery;
Whereas more than 1,000,000 wreaths have been sent to locations, including 
        national cemeteries and veterans memorials, in every State and overseas;
Whereas the mission of the Wreaths Across America project to ``Remember, Honor, 
        Teach'' is carried out in part by coordinating wreath-laying ceremonies 
        at Arlington National Cemetery as well as veterans cemeteries and other 
        locations in all 50 States;
Whereas the Wreaths Across America project carries out a week-long veterans 
        parade between Maine and Virginia, stopping along the way to spread a 
        message about the importance of remembering the fallen heroes of the 
        United States, honoring those who serve, and teaching the people of the 
        United States about the sacrifices made by veterans and their families 
        to preserve the freedoms in the United States;
Whereas in 2012, wreaths were sent to more than 800 locations across the United 
        States and overseas, 100 more locations than the previous year;
Whereas in December 2013, the Patriot Guard Riders, a motorcycle and motor 
        vehicle group that is dedicated to patriotic events and includes more 
        than 250,000 members nationwide, will continue the tradition of the 
        group of escorting a tractor-trailer filled with donated wreaths from 
        Harrington, Maine to Arlington National Cemetery;
Whereas thousands of individuals volunteer each December to escort and lay the 
        wreaths;
Whereas December 15, 2012, was previously designated by the Senate as ``Wreaths 
        Across America Day''; and
Whereas the Wreaths Across America project will continue the proud legacy on 
        December 14, 2013, bringing approximately 130,000 wreaths to Arlington 
        National Cemetery on that day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates December 14, 2013, as ``Wreaths Across 
        America Day'';
            (2) honors the Wreaths Across America project, the Patriot 
        Guard Riders, and all of the volunteers and donors involved in 
        this worthy tradition; and
            (3) recognizes the sacrifices that our veterans, members of 
        the Armed Forces, and their families have made, and continue to 
        make, for our great Nation.
                                 <all>
