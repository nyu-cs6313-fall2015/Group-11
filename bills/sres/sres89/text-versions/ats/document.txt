                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating March 25, 2013, as ``National Cerebral Palsy Awareness 
                                 Day''.

Whereas the term ``cerebral palsy'' refers to any number of neurological 
        disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently 
        affect body movement and the muscle coordination necessary to maintain 
        balance and posture;
Whereas cerebral palsy is caused by damage to 1 or more specific areas of the 
        brain, which usually occurs during fetal development, before, during, or 
        shortly after birth, or during infancy;
Whereas the majority of children who have cerebral palsy are born with the 
        disorder, although cerebral palsy may remain undetected for months or 
        years;
Whereas 75 percent of people with cerebral palsy also have 1 or more 
        developmental disabilities, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, 
        autism, visual impairment, and blindness;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released information 
        indicating that cerebral palsy is increasingly prevalent and that 
        approximately 1 in 278 children have cerebral palsy;
Whereas approximately 800,000 people in the United States are affected by 
        cerebral palsy;
Whereas, although there is no cure for cerebral palsy, treatment often improves 
        the capabilities of a child with cerebral palsy;
Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful that breakthroughs in cerebral 
        palsy research will be forthcoming;
Whereas researchers across the United States are conducting important research 
        projects involving cerebral palsy; and
Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise awareness in the general 
        public and the medical community about cerebral palsy: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 25, 2013, as ``National Cerebral Palsy 
        Awareness Day'';
            (2) encourages all people in the United States to become 
        more informed and aware of cerebral palsy; and
            (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to Reaching for the Stars: A 
        Foundation of Hope for Children with Cerebral Palsy.
                                 <all>
