                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the month of June 2013 as ``National Post-Traumatic Stress 
                      Disorder Awareness Month''.

Whereas the brave men and women Armed Forces of the United States, who proudly 
        serve the United States, risk their lives to protect the freedom of the 
        United States, and deserve the investment of every possible resource to 
        ensure their lasting physical, mental, and emotional well-being;
Whereas more than 2,000,000 service members have deployed overseas as part of 
        overseas contingency operations since the events of September 11, 2001;
Whereas the military has sustained an operational tempo for a period of time 
        unprecedented in the history of the United States, with many service 
        members deploying multiple times to combat zones, placing them at high 
        risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``PTSD'');
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs reports that--

    (1) since October of 2001, more than 286,000 of the approximately 
900,000 veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
and Operation New Dawn who have used Department of Veterans Affairs health 
care have been coded for PTSD;

    (2) in fiscal year 2011, more than 475,000 of the nearly 6,000,000 
veterans from all wars who sought care at a Department of Veterans Affairs 
medical center received treatment for PTSD; and

    (3) of veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation 
Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn who are using Veterans Affairs health 
care, more than 486,000--or 54 percent--have received a diagnosis for at 
least 1 mental health disorder;

Whereas many cases of PTSD remain unreported, undiagnosed, and untreated due to 
        a lack of awareness about PTSD and the persistent stigma associated with 
        mental health conditions;
Whereas PTSD significantly increases the risk of depression, suicide, and drug- 
        and alcohol-related disorders and deaths, especially if left untreated;
Whereas symptoms of PTSD or other mental health disorders create unique 
        challenges for veterans seeking employment;
Whereas the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs have made significant 
        advances in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of PTSD and the 
        symptoms of PTSD, but many challenges remain; and
Whereas the establishment of a National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness 
        Month will raise public awareness about issues related to PTSD, reduce 
        the stigma associated with PTSD, and help ensure that those suffering 
        from the invisible wounds of war receive proper treatment: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 2013, as ``National Post-Traumatic 
        Stress Disorder Awareness Month'';
            (2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense to educate service 
        members, veterans, the families of service members and 
        veterans, and the public about the causes, symptoms, and 
        treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder; and
            (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense.
                                 <all>
