                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating July 11, 2014, as ``Collector Car Appreciation Day'' and 
recognizing that the collection and restoration of historic and classic 
cars is an important part of preserving the technological achievements 
              and cultural heritage of the United States.

Whereas many people in the United States maintain classic automobiles as a 
        pastime and do so with great passion and as a means of individual 
        expression;
Whereas the Senate recognizes the effect that the more than 100-year history of 
        the automobile has had on the economic progress of the United States and 
        supports wholeheartedly all activities involved in the restoration and 
        exhibition of classic automobiles;
Whereas the collection, restoration, and preservation of automobiles is an 
        activity shared across generations and across all segments of society;
Whereas thousands of local car clubs and related businesses have been 
        instrumental in preserving a historic part of the heritage of the United 
        States by encouraging the restoration and exhibition of such vintage 
        works of art;
Whereas automotive restoration provides well-paying, high-skilled jobs for 
        people in all 50 States; and
Whereas automobiles have provided the inspiration for music, photography, 
        cinema, fashion, and other artistic pursuits that have become part of 
        the popular culture of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates July 11, 2014, as ``Collector Car 
        Appreciation Day'';
            (2) recognizes that the collection and restoration of 
        historic and classic cars is an important part of preserving 
        the technological achievements and cultural heritage of the 
        United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to engage in 
        events and commemorations of Collector Car Appreciation Day 
        that create opportunities for collector car owners to educate 
        young people about the importance of preserving the cultural 
        heritage of the United States, including through the collection 
        and restoration of collector cars.
