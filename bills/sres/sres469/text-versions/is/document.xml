			 conducted in accordance with the requirements of section 1023 of the
			 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (10 U.S.C. 801
			 note) and Executive Order No. 13567, that the individual is no longer a
			 threat to the United States, or the individual is ordered released by a
			 United States court, or such an individual can be transferred if the
			 Secretary determines that actions have been or are planned to be taken
			 which will substantially mitigate the risk of the individual engaging or
			 re-engaging in any terrorist activity or other hostile activity that
			 threatens the United States or United States persons or interests and the
			 transfer is in the national security interest of the United States;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 states that the Secretary of

			 release, an explanation of why the transfer or release is in the national
			 security interests of the United States, a description of any actions
			 taken to mitigate the risks of reengagement by the individual to be
			 transferred or released, a copy of any Periodic Review Board findings
			 relating to the individual, and a description of the evaluation conducted
			 pursuant to factors that must be considered prior to such a transfer or
			 release;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/113/76">Public Law 113–76</external-xref>) states that none of the funds
			 appropriated or otherwise made available in that  Act may be used to
