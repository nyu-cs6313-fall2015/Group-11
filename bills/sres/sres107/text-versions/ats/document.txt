                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring military children during the National Month of the Military 
                                 Child.

Whereas more than 2,000,000 men and women are demonstrating their courage and 
        commitment to freedom by serving in the Armed Forces of the United 
        States;
Whereas 43.9 percent of members of the Armed Forces, when deployed away from 
        their permanent duty stations, leave families with children behind;
Whereas no one feels the effect of deployments more than the children of 
        deployed members of the Armed Forces;
Whereas, as of March 2013, 4,802 children had lost a parent serving in Operation 
        Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom;
Whereas the daily struggles and personal sacrifices of children of members of 
        the Armed Forces too often go unnoticed;
Whereas countless children live with a parent who is a member of the Armed 
        Forces and who bears a visible or invisible wound of war;
Whereas the children of members of the Armed Forces are a source of pride and 
        honor to the people of the United States and it is fitting that the 
        United States recognize their contributions and celebrate their spirit;
Whereas the National Month of the Military Child, observed in April each year, 
        recognizes military children for their sacrifices and contributes to 
        demonstrating the unconditional support of the United States for members 
        of the Armed Forces;
Whereas, in addition to programs of the Department of Defense to support 
        military families and military children, various programs and campaigns 
        have been established in the private sector to honor, support, and thank 
        military children by fostering awareness and appreciation for the 
        sacrifices and the challenges they face; and
Whereas a month-long salute to military children will encourage support for 
        those organizations and campaigns established to provide direct support 
        for military children and families: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) joins the Secretary of Defense in honoring the children 
        of members of the Armed Forces and recognizes that those 
        children also share in the burden of protecting the United 
        States; and
            (2) urges the people of the United States to join with the 
        military community in observing the National Month of the 
        Military Child with appropriate ceremonies and activities that 
        honor, support, and thank military children.
                                 <all>
