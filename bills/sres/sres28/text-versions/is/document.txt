                               RESOLUTION


 
         To provide sufficient time for legislation to be read.

    Resolved, That (a) it shall not be in order for the Senate to 
consider any bill, resolution, message, conference report, amendment, 
treaty, or any other measure or matter until 1 session day has passed 
since introduction for every 20 pages included in the measure or matter 
in the usual form plus 1 session day for any number of remaining pages 
less than 20 in the usual form.
    (b)(1) Any Senator may raise a point of order that consideration of 
any bill, resolution, message, conference report, amendment, treaty, or 
any other measure or matter is not in order under subsection (a). No 
motion to table the point of order shall be in order.
    (2) Any Senator may move to waive a point of order raised under 
paragraph (1) by an affirmative yea and nay vote of two-thirds of the 
Senators duly chosen and sworn. All motions to waive under this 
paragraph shall be debatable collectively for not to exceed 3 hours 
equally divided between the Senator raising the point for order and the 
Senator moving to waive the point of order or their designees. A motion 
to waive the point of order shall not be amendable.
    (3) This resolution is enacted pursuant to the power granted to 
each House of Congress to determine the Rules of its Proceedings in 
clause 2 of section 5 of article I of the Constitution of the United 
States.
                                 <all>
