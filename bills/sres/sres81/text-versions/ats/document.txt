                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating March 19, 2013, as the 40th anniversary of National Ag 
                                  Day.

Whereas, in 1973, the National Ag Day program was established to increase public 
        awareness of the vital role of agriculture in the United States;
Whereas the agriculture industry is part of the very fabric of the United 
        States, driving the economy, fostering ingenuity, and preserving the 
        deepest values of the people of the United States;
Whereas the average farmer in the United States today feeds nearly 150 people, a 
        dramatic increase from just 25 people per farmer in the 1960s;
Whereas the agriculture industry in the United States produces an incredible 
        variety of meats, grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, beans, nuts, seeds, 
        and other important foods;
Whereas more than 2,000,000 farmers and ranchers contribute more than 
        $300,000,000,000 to the United States economy every year; and
Whereas farmers comprise less than 2 percent of the population of the United 
        States, yet produce more than enough food for the people of the United 
        States and hundreds of millions of people around the world: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the National Ag Day program for its annual 
        celebration of agriculture in the United States;
            (2) honors the researchers, entrepreneurs, businesses, and 
        innovators who support farm families in the United States and 
        help drive the agriculture economy; and
            (3) celebrates family farmers and ranchers, who are the 
        backbone of food production in the United States and produce 
        the safest, most abundant, and most affordable food supply in 
        the world.
                                 <all>
