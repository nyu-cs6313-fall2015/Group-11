                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the goals of Catholic Schools Week and honoring the 
    valuable contributions of Catholic schools in the United States.

Whereas Catholic schools in the United States have received international 
        acclaim for academic excellence while providing students with lessons 
        that extend far beyond the classroom;
Whereas Catholic schools present a broad curriculum that emphasizes the lifelong 
        development of moral, intellectual, physical, and social values in the 
        young people of the United States;
Whereas Catholic schools in the United States today educate 2,001,740 students 
        and maintain a student-to-teacher ratio of 13 to 1;
Whereas the faculty members of Catholic schools teach a highly diverse body of 
        students;
Whereas the graduation rate for all Catholic schools is 99 percent;
Whereas 85 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on to college;
Whereas Catholic schools produce students who are strongly dedicated to faith, 
        values, families, and communities by providing an intellectually 
        stimulating environment rich in spiritual character and moral 
        development; and
Whereas in the 1972 pastoral message concerning Catholic education, the National 
        Conference of Catholic Bishops stated: ``Education is one of the most 
        important ways by which the Church fulfills its commitment to the 
        dignity of the person and building of community. Community is central to 
        education ministry, both as a necessary condition and an ardently 
        desired goal. The educational efforts of the Church, therefore, must be 
        directed to forming persons-in-community; for the education of the 
        individual Christian is important not only to his solitary destiny, but 
        also the destinies of the many communities in which he lives.'': Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the goals of Catholic Schools Week, an event 
        cosponsored by the National Catholic Educational Association 
        and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that 
        recognizes the vital contributions of thousands of Catholic 
        elementary and secondary schools in the United States; and
            (2) commends Catholic schools, students, parents, and 
        teachers across the United States for ongoing contributions to 
        education and for playing a vital role in promoting and 
        ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the United States.
