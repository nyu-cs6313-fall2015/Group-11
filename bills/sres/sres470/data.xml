  <summary>7/7/2014--Passed Senate without amendment.
Amends S.Res. 400 (94th Congress) with respect to the jurisdiction of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (Select Committee) to review, hold hearings, and report the nominations of individuals for positions in the intelligence community for which appointments are made by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.

Sets forth a process for the Select Committee to engage in a sequential referral with the Committee on Armed Services of nominations to the positions of Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), NSA Inspector General, Director of the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), or NRO Inspector General. Makes the order of referral dependent upon whether the nominee, at the time of the nomination, is a member of the Armed Forces on active duty.

Requires such nominations to be referred: (1) first to the Committee on Armed Services and then to the Select Committee (if and when reported by the Committee on Armed Services) if the nominee, at the time of the nomination, is a member of the Armed Forces on active duty; or (2) first to the Select Committee and then to the Committee on Armed Services (if and when reported by the Select Committee) if the nominee, at the time of the nomination, is not a member of the Armed Forces on active duty.

Prohibits the second referral from exceeding 30 calendar days, except that in cases when the 30-day period expires while the Senate is in recess, the second committee is provided 5 additional calendar days after the Senate reconvenes to report the nomination. Requires the nomination to be automatically discharged and placed on the Executive Calendar if such reporting period for subsequent referral expires.</summary>
