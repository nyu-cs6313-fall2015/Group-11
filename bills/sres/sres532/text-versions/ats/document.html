                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week beginning September 7, 2014, as ``National Direct 
               Support Professionals Recognition Week''.

Whereas direct care workers, personal assistants, personal attendants, in-home 
        support workers, and paraprofessionals (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``direct support professionals'') are the primary providers of publicly-
        funded long-term support and services for millions of individuals with 
        disabilities;
Whereas direct support professionals must build a close, respectful, and trusted 
        relationship with individuals with disabilities;
Whereas direct support professionals assist individuals with disabilities with 
        intimate personal care assistance on a daily basis;
Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range of individualized 
        support, including--

    (1) preparation of meals;

    (2) helping with medications;

    (3) assisting with bathing and dressing;

    (4) assisting individuals with physical disabilities with access to 
their environment;

    (5) providing transportation to school, work, religious, and 
recreational activities; and

    (6) helping with general aspects of daily living, such as financial 
matters, medical appointments, and personal interests;

Whereas direct support professionals provide essential support to help keep 
        individuals with disabilities connected to family, friends, and 
        community;
Whereas direct support professionals support individuals with disabilities in 
        making choices that lead to meaningful, productive lives;
Whereas direct support professionals are the key to helping individuals with 
        disabilities to live successfully in the community, and to avoid more 
        costly institutional care;
Whereas the participation of direct support professionals in medical care 
        planning is critical to the successful transition from medical events to 
        post-acute care and long-term support and services;
Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are the primary financial 
        providers for their families and often work multiple jobs to make ends 
        meet;
Whereas direct support professionals are a critical element in supporting 
        individuals who are receiving health care services for severe chronic 
        health conditions and individuals with with functional limitations;
Whereas while direct support professionals work and pay taxes, many direct 
        support professionals earn poverty-level wages and are therefore 
        eligible for the same Federal and State public assistance programs on 
        which individuals with disabilities served by direct support 
        professionals must also depend;
Whereas Federal and State policies assert the right of certain individuals with 
        a disability to live in a residential setting in the community, or an 
        institutional setting of their choice, and the Supreme Court of the 
        United States, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), confirmed that 
        right for certain individuals;
Whereas, as of 2014, the majority of direct support professionals are employed 
        in home and community-based settings and this majority is projected to 
        increase over the next decade;
Whereas there is a documented and increasing critical shortage of direct support 
        professionals throughout the United States; and
Whereas many direct support professionals are forced to leave their jobs due to 
        inadequate wages and benefits and limited opportunities for advancement, 
        creating demonstrated high turnover and vacancy rates, which adversely 
        affect the quality of support and the safety and health of individuals 
        with disabilities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning September 7, 2014, as 
        ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';
            (2) recognizes the dedication of direct support 
        professionals and the vital role direct support professionals 
        have in enhancing the lives of individuals with disabilities of 
        all ages;
            (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support 
        professionals in supporting individuals with disabilities and 
        their families in the United States;
            (4) identifies direct support professionals as integral to 
        long-term support and services for individuals with 
        disabilities; and
            (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public 
        policies affecting individuals with disabilities in the United 
        States depends on the dedication of direct support 
        professionals.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
