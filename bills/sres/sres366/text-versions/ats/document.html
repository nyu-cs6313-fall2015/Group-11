                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis 
                            Awareness Week.

Whereas multiple sclerosis (MS) can impact people of all ages, races, and 
        ethnicities;
Whereas MS is 2 to 3 times more common in women than in men;
Whereas while MS is not directly inherited, studies show there are genetic and, 
        probably, environmental, ethnic, and geographic factors that make 
        certain individuals more susceptible to the disease;
Whereas worldwide, there are approximately 2,300,000 people who have been 
        diagnosed with MS;
Whereas MS is typically diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, however, it is 
        estimated that between 8,000 and 10,000 children and adolescents in the 
        United States are living with MS;
Whereas MS is an unpredictable neurological disease that interrupts the flow of 
        information within the brain and between the brain and the rest of the 
        body;
Whereas symptoms of MS range from numbness and tingling in the extremities to 
        blindness and paralysis, and the progress, severity, and specific 
        symptoms of MS in any affected individual cannot yet be predicted;
Whereas there is no single laboratory test available that provides a definitive 
        diagnosis for MS;
Whereas the exact cause of MS is still unknown, and there is no cure;
Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, a national network of independent 
        organizations dedicated to enhancing quality of life for all those 
        affected by MS, recognizes and supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness 
        Week during March of every year;
Whereas the mission of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition is to enhance 
        cooperation among organizations to provide greater benefits to 
        individuals and families affected by MS;
Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are to invite people to 
        join the movement to end MS, encourage people to demonstrate their 
        commitment to moving toward a world free from MS, and acknowledge those 
        who have dedicated their time and talent to advancing MS research and 
        programs; and
Whereas this year Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week is being recognized during 
        the week of March 3, 2014, through March 9, 2014: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis 
        Awareness Week;
            (2) supports promoting awareness of individuals who are 
        affected by multiple sclerosis;
            (3) encourages States, localities, and the territories and 
        possessions of the United States to support the goals and 
        ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by issuing 
        proclamations designating March 3, 2014, through March 9, 2014, 
        as Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
            (4) commends the efforts of States, localities, and the 
        territories and possessions of the United States to support the 
        goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week;
            (5) encourages media organizations to participate in 
        Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week by educating the public about 
        multiple sclerosis;
            (6) recognizes and reaffirms the commitment of the United 
        States to ending multiple sclerosis by supporting multiple 
        sclerosis research and education programs;
            (7) supports all individuals in the United States living 
        with multiple sclerosis;
            (8) expresses gratitude to the family and friends of 
        individuals living with multiple sclerosis, who are a source of 
        love and encouragement to those individuals; and
            (9) salutes the health care professionals and medical 
        researchers who--
                    (A) provide assistance to individuals affected by 
                multiple sclerosis; and
                    (B) continue to work towards finding new ways to 
                stop the progression of the disease, treat its 
                symptoms, and end multiple sclerosis forever.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
