                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating the 200\th\ anniversary of ``The Star-Spangled Banner''.

Whereas during the War of 1812, Great Britain turned its full attention to the 
        war effort in North America following its defeat of Napoleon's armies on 
        the European continent in April 1814;
Whereas British forces dealt a devastating blow to the forces of the United 
        States at the Battle of Bladensburg and were, as a consequence, able to 
        march into Washington, D.C. unopposed and, on August 24, 1814, burn the 
        United States Capitol Building, the Executive Mansion, now known as the 
        White House, and other government buildings;
Whereas on September 13, 1814, with the fate of the Nation uncertain, Fort 
        McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland, withstood 25 hours of bombardment by the 
        British Royal Navy;
Whereas on the following morning, the soldiers of Fort McHenry hoisted an 
        enormous American flag, the sight of which inspired Francis Scott Key to 
        write a poem he titled ``The Star-Spangled Banner'';
Whereas on December 24, 1814, American and British commissioners signed the 
        Treaty of Ghent, which would be ratified the following February, 
        bringing the War of 1812 to an end and firmly establishing the United 
        States of America as a sovereign nation within the family of nations;
Whereas on March 3, 1931, President Herbert Hoover signed Public Law 71-823, 
        designating ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as the national anthem of the 
        United States;
Whereas ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was written to celebrate American courage 
        at a time when the torch of liberty looked as if it were about to be 
        extinguished;
Whereas singing the national anthem at large public gatherings, such as sporting 
        events, brings patriotic unity to the great melting pot known as the 
        United States of America;
Whereas our national anthem has become an enduring symbol of ``the land of the 
        free and the home of the brave'';
Whereas the people of the United States are celebrating the bicentennial of 
        ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' with a variety of commemorative events 
        nationwide during the week of September 10 through 16, 2014, including 
        the ``O Say Can You See! Star-Spangled Spectacular'' festival in 
        Baltimore on September 13, 2014, which included concerts and an 
        extraordinary fireworks display over Fort McHenry and the Baltimore 
        harbor; and
Whereas it is especially important to educate young people and new citizens of 
        the United States about the history and meaning of the national anthem: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the Senate designates the period from September 2014 
        through September 2015 as the ``Year of National Thanksgiving 
        for `The Star-Spangled Banner''';
            (2) the Senate encourages all State and local governments 
        and the people of the United States to observe this period of 
        thanksgiving with appropriate ceremonies, activities, 
        educational outreach, and reflection; and
            (3) it is the sense of the Senate that ``The Star-Spangled 
        Banner'' shall retain all current verses and remain our 
        national anthem in perpetuity.
                                 <all>
