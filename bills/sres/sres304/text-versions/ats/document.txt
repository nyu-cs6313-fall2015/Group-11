                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the 30th anniversary of the date of the restoration by the 
Federal Government of Federal recognition to the Confederated Tribes of 
        the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon, November 22, 1983.

Whereas the Grand Ronde Restoration Act (25 U.S.C. 713 et seq.), which was 
        signed by the President on November 22, 1983, restored Federal 
        recognition to the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of 
        Oregon;
Whereas the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon 
        historically inhabited land that extended from the summit of the Cascade 
        Range, west along the shores of the Columbia River to the summit of the 
        Coast Range, and south to the California border;
Whereas in addition to restoring Federal recognition, that Act and other Federal 
        Indian statutes have provided the means for the Confederated Tribes to 
        achieve the goals of cultural restoration, economic self-sufficiency, 
        and the attainment of a standard of living equivalent to that enjoyed by 
        other citizens of the United States;
Whereas by enacting the Grand Ronde Restoration Act (25 U.S.C. 713 et seq.), the 
        Federal Government--

    (1) declared that the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community 
of Oregon were eligible for all Federal services and benefits provided to 
federally recognized tribes;

    (2) called for the establishment of a tribal reservation; and

    (3) granted the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of 
Oregon self-government for the betterment of tribal members, including the 
ability to set tribal rolls;

Whereas the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon have 
        embraced Federal recognition and self-sufficiency statutes and are 
        actively working to better the lives of tribal members; and
Whereas economic self-sufficiency, which was the goal of restoring Federal 
        recognition for the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of 
        Oregon, is being realized through many projects: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 30th anniversary of 
November 22, 1983, the date on which the Federal Government restored 
Federal recognition to the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde 
Community of Oregon.
                                 <all>
