Whereas National Travel and Tourism Week was established in 1983 through the 
        enactment of the Joint Resolution entitled ``Joint Resolution to 
        designate the week beginning May 27, 1984, as `National Tourism Week''', 
        approved November 29, 1983 (Public Law 98-178; 97 Stat. 1126), which 
        recognized the value of travel and tourism;
Whereas National Travel and Tourism Week is celebrated across the United States 
        from May 4 through May 12, 2013;
Whereas more than 120 travel destinations throughout the United States are 
        holding events in honor of National Travel and Tourism Week;
Whereas one out of every 8 jobs in the United States depends on travel and 
        tourism and the industry supports more than 14,600,000 jobs in the 
        United States;
Whereas the travel and tourism industry employs individuals in all 50 States and 
        all the territories of the United States;
Whereas international travel to the United States is the single largest export 
        industry in the country, generating a trade surplus balance of 
        approximately $45,000,000,000;
Whereas the travel and tourism industry, Congress, and the President have worked 
        to streamline the visa process and make the United States welcoming to 
        visitors from other countries;
Whereas travel and tourism provide significant economic benefits to the United 
        States by generating nearly $2,000,000,000,000 in annual economic 
        output;
Whereas leisure travel allows individuals to experience the rich cultural 
        heritage and educational opportunities of the United States and its 
        communities; and
Whereas the immense value of travel and tourism cannot be overstated: Now, 
        therefore, be it

        States.
