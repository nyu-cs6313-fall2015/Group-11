                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating the centennial anniversary of the establishment of the 
                    Congressional Research Service.

Whereas, in 1914, Congress recognized the need for greater assistance and 
        established a reference unit within the Library of Congress to support 
        an informed and independent legislature;
Whereas the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 (2 U.S.C. 28 et seq.) 
        transformed the Legislative Reference Service into the Congressional 
        Research Service, expanding its size and analytic capacity;
Whereas the Congressional Research Service is housed within the Library of 
        Congress and benefits from the unparalleled collections of the Library 
        of Congress to complete research and analysis and to disseminate 
        information and materials to assist Congress;
Whereas Congressional Research Service products are the result of collaboration 
        between a diverse workforce consisting of analysts, attorneys, 
        information professionals, and support staff;
Whereas the Congressional Research Service strives to provide accurate and 
        objective assistance to all members and committees at all stages of the 
        legislative process, and in a timely, confidential, and non-partisan 
        manner; and
Whereas the Congressional Research Service provides Congress with analysis and 
        information on legislative and oversight issues in reports, memoranda, 
        seminars, and briefings: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the centennial anniversary of the 
        establishment of the Congressional Research Service and 
        commends the employees of the Congressional Research Service 
        for their service to Congress and the people of the United 
        States; and
            (2) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--
                    (A) the Librarian of Congress; and
                    (B) the Director of the Congressional Research 
                Service.
                                 <all>
