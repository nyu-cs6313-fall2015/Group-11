                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing February 19, 2013 as the centennial of Mosaic, a faith-
  based organization that was founded in Nebraska and now serves more 
  than 3,600 individuals with intellectual disabilities in 10 States.

Whereas the roots of Mosaic, a faith-based organization that serves individuals 
        with intellectual disabilities, trace back to the commitment of a 
        Nebraskan to ensure that individuals with disabilities were cared for 
        and inspired by a loving community;
Whereas, on February 19, 1913, a Nebraska pastor, the Reverend K.G. William 
        Dahl, founded Bethphage Inner Mission Association (referred to in this 
        preamble as ``Bethphage'') in Axtell, Nebraska as a ministry for 
        individuals with intellectual disabilities;
Whereas, on October 20, 1925, a school endeavoring to create opportunities for 
        children with disabilities took root in Sterling, Nebraska when the 
        Reverends Julius Moehl, August Hoeger, and William Fruehling, and laymen 
        John Aden and William Ehmen, established Martin Luther Home Society, 
        which later became known as Martin Luther Homes;
Whereas, with the increasing need for community-based programs for individuals 
        with disabilities in the 1970s and 1980s, both Bethphage and Martin 
        Luther Homes grew into ministries that served locations across the 
        United States;
Whereas the shared vision and mission of the 2 Nebraska-born ministries, to care 
        for the most vulnerable individuals, laid the foundation for the 
        formation of a powerful partnership;
Whereas, on July 1, 2003, Mosaic was officially established through a 
        consolidation of Bethphage and Martin Luther Homes; and
Whereas Mosaic has created a legacy of love, providing individualized support to 
        thousands of individuals in the United States and extending its work 
        beyond the borders of the United States through an international 
        alliance: Now therefore be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes February 19, 2013 as the centennial of 
        Mosaic;
            (2) recognizes the important and valuable contributions 
        that individuals with intellectual disabilities make in their 
        communities;
            (3) celebrates the integral role that Mosaic has played in 
        the growth and success of individuals with intellectual 
        disabilities; and
            (4) congratulates the men and women who have touched 
        countless lives by contributing to the mission of Mosaic to 
        create a life of possibilities for individuals with 
        intellectual disabilities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
