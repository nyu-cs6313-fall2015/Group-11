                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing condolences and supporting assistance for the victims of the 
               historic flooding in the Western Balkans.

Whereas record rainfall beginning on May 13, 2014, has led to widespread 
        flooding in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, and the 
        Republic of Serbia, causing thousands of landslides, massive 
        destruction, and loss of life;
Whereas by May 22, 2014, the flooding caused over 40 deaths and impacted over 
        500,000 people across the region, particularly in western Serbia and 
        eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina;
Whereas the equivalent of 3 months of rain fell during the course of 3 days, 
        making this the worst flooding event in Serbia and Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina in 120 years;
Whereas the flooding has left thousands of people stranded in their homes 
        waiting for assistance, displaced, or without shelter;
Whereas according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent 
        Societies, 300,000 people in Serbia and 50,000 people in Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina were left without clean water or electricity;
Whereas the Foreign Ministry of Bosnia and Herzegovina has reported that the 
        flooding rendered 100,000 buildings unusable, caused 500,000 people to 
        evacuate or flee their homes, and prompted 14 municipalities to declare 
        a state of emergency;
Whereas the Government of Serbia has described the situation in that country as 
        ``catastrophic'', and estimates that at least 25,000 people have been 
        forced to evacuate, particularly in the town and municipality of 
        Obrenovac, and that the flooding has caused over 100,000,000 Euros 
        ($140,000,000) in damage to the Kolubara coal mine that supplies the 
        Nikola Tesla power plants;
Whereas soldiers and energy workers scrambled to erect sandbag barriers to 
        protect the Kostolac power plant and the Nikola Tesla power plants, 
        which provide half of the country's electricity, from the waters of the 
        flooded Sava, Kolubara, and Tamnava Rivers;
Whereas, according to the International Medical Corps, as many as 120,000 
        landmines remaining from the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s may have been 
        lost or dislodged due to landslides, causing great concern for public 
        safety;
Whereas the United States Government has approved or provided $2,060,000 in 
        funds through the United States Agency for International Development's 
        Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, the Department of 
        Defense, and the Under Secretary of Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs 
        for the Republic of Serbia;
Whereas the United States Government has provided $2,740,000 in humanitarian 
        assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina; and
Whereas the governments and people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of 
        Croatia, and the Republic of Serbia share an increasing commitment to 
        core democratic values, reconciliation, and European integration: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses deep sympathy to all those affected by the 
        flooding in the Western Balkans for the terrible loss of life 
        and massive destruction;
            (2) expresses solidarity with the people of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, and the Republic of 
        Serbia, as well as a continued desire to provide assistance to 
        help their countries recover from this natural disaster;
            (3) expresses ongoing support for humanitarian and 
        reconstruction assistance provided by relief agencies and the 
        international community as immediate and long-term needs are 
        identified;
            (4) commends local authorities, first responders and rescue 
        personnel, NGOs, volunteers, and everyday citizens for their 
        efforts to organize and deliver disaster relief to communities 
        in need across Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, 
        and the Republic of Serbia;
            (5) commends the United States Government agencies, 
        including USAID and the Department of Defense, for their 
        response to the natural disaster; and
            (6) urges additional assistance by other nations and 
        organizations as needed to alleviate the difficult 
        circumstances and suffering of the people of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, and the Republic of 
        Serbia, and to assist them in their recovery efforts.
