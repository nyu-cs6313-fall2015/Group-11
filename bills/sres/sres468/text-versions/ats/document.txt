To authorize the production of records by the Permanent Subcommittee on 
 Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
                                Affairs.

Whereas, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on 
        Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs conducted an investigation 
        into Caterpillar Inc.'s Offshore Tax Strategy;
Whereas, the Subcommittee has received a request from a federal regulatory 
        agency for access to records of the Subcommittee's investigation;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate can, by administrative or judicial process, be 
        taken from such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate is needed for the promotion of justice, the Senate will take 
        such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the 
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs, acting jointly, are authorized to 
provide to law enforcement officials, regulatory agencies, and other 
entities or individuals duly authorized by federal, state, or foreign 
governments, records of the Subcommittee's investigation into 
Caterpillar's Offshore Tax Strategy.
