                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of September 2013 as National 
                    Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.

Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers;
Whereas ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths among women 
        in the United States;
Whereas, in 2013, approximately 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer will be 
        diagnosed, and 14,400 women will die of ovarian cancer in the United 
        States;
Whereas the mortality rate for ovarian cancer has not significantly decreased 
        since the ``War on Cancer'' was declared more than 40 years ago;
Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and 90 percent of women 
        diagnosed with ovarian cancer do not have a family history that puts 
        them at a higher risk;
Whereas some women, such as those with a family history of breast or ovarian 
        cancer, are at higher risk for developing the disease;
Whereas the Pap test is sensitive and specific to the early detection of 
        cervical cancer, but not ovarian cancer;
Whereas there is currently no reliable early detection test for ovarian cancer;
Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of ovarian cancer often 
        include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling 
        full quickly, urinary symptoms, and several other symptoms that are 
        easily confused with other diseases;
Whereas, in June 2007, the first national consensus statement on ovarian cancer 
        symptoms was developed to provide consistency in describing symptoms to 
        make it easier for women to learn and remember the symptoms;
Whereas there are known methods to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, including 
        prophylactic surgery, oral contraceptives, and breastfeeding;
Whereas due to the lack of a reliable early detection test, 75 percent of cases 
        of ovarian cancer are detected at an advanced stage, making the overall 
        5-year survival rate only 46 percent;
Whereas there are factors that are known to reduce the risk for ovarian cancer 
        and that play an important role in the prevention of the disease;
Whereas awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer by women and health care 
        providers can lead to a quicker diagnosis;
Whereas, each year during the month of September, the Ovarian Cancer National 
        Alliance and its partner members hold a number of events to increase 
        public awareness of ovarian cancer; and
Whereas September 2013 should be designated as ``National Ovarian Cancer 
        Awareness Month'' to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of National 
Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.
                                 <all>
