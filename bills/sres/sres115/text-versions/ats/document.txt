                               RESOLUTION


 
  Commending the heroism, courage, and sacrifice of Sean Collier, an 
officer in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department, 
 Martin Richard, an 8-year-old resident of Dorchester, Massachusetts, 
  Krystle Campbell, a native of Medford, Massachusetts, Lu Lingzi, a 
 student at Boston University, and all the victims who are recovering 
from injuries caused by the attacks in Boston, Massachusetts, including 
       Richard Donohue, Jr., an officer in the Massachusetts Bay 
          Transportation Authority Transit Police Department.

Whereas, in the aftermath of the deadly bombings that occurred on Patriots' Day, 
        April 15, 2013, during the running of the 117th Boston Marathon, the 
        residents of Massachusetts and the people of the United States witnessed 
        the incredible bravery, dedication, and sacrifice of law enforcement 
        officers, first responders, and citizen heroes;
Whereas Sean Collier of Wilmington, Massachusetts, an officer in the 
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``MIT'') Police Department, gave his life in the line of duty, the 
        ultimate sacrifice;
Whereas Officer Sean Collier was protecting the students of MIT when he was 
        killed as he sat in his police cruiser;
Whereas Officer Sean Collier was known by his family, friends, and co-workers as 
        a generous, kind, friendly, and devoted individual and officer;
Whereas the people of the United States join with the family of Officer Sean 
        Collier, the MIT community, and the residents of Massachusetts in 
        mourning the loss of Officer Sean Collier, a dedicated, hardworking, and 
        respected young police officer;
Whereas the people of the United States remember Martin Richard, an 8-year-old 
        boy from Dorchester, Massachusetts;
Whereas Martin Richard loved to play sports and draw pictures, and was dearly 
        loved by his family, friends, classmates, and community;
Whereas the people of the United States will always remember and strive to live 
        by the poignant and powerful message from Martin Richard: ``No more 
        hurting people. Peace.'';
Whereas the people of the United States remember Krystle Campbell, who grew up 
        in Medford, Massachusetts and attended every Boston Marathon since she 
        was a young girl;
Whereas Krystle Campbell will be remembered as a selfless and caring person who 
        was always there for others;
Whereas the people of the United States are inspired by Krystle Campbell and her 
        kind act of caring for her grandmother, who was recovering from an 
        operation;
Whereas the people of the United States remember Lu Lingzi, who came to the 
        United States from China to study statistics at Boston University;
Whereas, on the morning of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, Lu Lingzi 
        posted on a social media site that she was enjoying her day;
Whereas Lu Lingzi is a reminder of our common humanity, and that senseless acts 
        of terrorism, such as the bombings that occurred during the running of 
        the Boston Marathon, are crimes that have no borders;
Whereas Richard Donohue, Jr., an officer in the Massachusetts Bay Transportation 
        Authority Transit Police Department, worked a shift at the Boston 
        Marathon on Monday, April 15, 2013, and was wounded early in the morning 
        on Friday, April 19, 2013, when he raced to assist officers from the MIT 
        and City of Cambridge Police Departments as they pursued the Boston 
        Marathon bombing suspects in Watertown, Massachusetts;
Whereas, during the ensuing shootout with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, 
        Officer Richard Donohue, Jr., and other officers, acting with complete 
        disregard for their own safety, withstood a barrage of gunfire and 
        explosives unleashed by the suspects;
Whereas, during the shootout with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, Officer 
        Richard Donohue, Jr., was seriously wounded by a bullet that nearly took 
        his life;
Whereas Officer Richard Donohue, Jr., is recovering from his injuries and 
        remains in critical but stable condition; and
Whereas the people of the United States pray for all the people who were wounded 
        during the attacks, and pledge to assist them in any way possible to 
        help them recover from their injuries: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the people of the United States honor the memories of 
        Officer Sean Collier, Martin Richard, Krystle Campbell, and Lu 
        Lingzi, and express deep condolences to their families and 
        friends;
            (2) Officer Sean Collier and Officer Richard Donohue, Jr., 
        represent the best of Massachusetts and of law enforcement;
            (3) the people of the United States convey profound 
        gratitude and prayers for a complete recovery to Officer 
        Richard Donohue, Jr., and to all of the other victims who are 
        recovering from injuries caused by the attacks in Boston, 
        Massachusetts;
            (4) the service and sacrifice of Officer Sean Collier and 
        Officer Richard Donohue, Jr., will never be forgotten by the 
        residents of Massachusetts or the people of the United States, 
        and will forever serve as an example of incredible bravery and 
        sacrifice; and
            (5) the people of the United States express thanks to the 
        men and women of law enforcement in the United States for their 
        unwavering determination, courage, and resolve to bring to 
        justice the people responsible for the bombings that occurred 
        during the running of the 117th Boston Marathon.
