                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing September 2014 as ``National Campus Safety Awareness 
 Month'' and supporting the goals and ideals of National Campus Safety 
                            Awareness Month.

Whereas people on college and university campuses are not immune from the 
        potential acts of crime that the rest of society in the United States 
        faces;
Whereas men and women deserve to learn in a positive and safe environment free 
        from sexual assault;
Whereas experts estimate that 1 in 5 female undergraduate students will 
        experience sexual assault or attempted sexual assault;
Whereas the aggressor in a sexual assault is usually an acquaintance or friend 
        of the victim;
Whereas a majority of sexual assaults are not reported to law enforcement;
Whereas the majority of stalking victims are between the ages of 18 and 24 years 
        old;
Whereas approximately 3 in 10 women are injured emotionally or psychologically 
        from being stalked;
Whereas the Clery Center for Security on Campus, a nonprofit group dedicated to 
        preventing violence, substance abuse, and other crimes on college and 
        university campuses, has designated September as ``National Campus 
        Safety Awareness Month''; and
Whereas National Campus Safety Awareness Month provides an opportunity for 
        campus communities to become engaged in efforts to improve campus 
        safety: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Campus Safety 
        Awareness Month; and
            (2) encourages colleges and universities throughout the 
        United States to provide campus safety and other crime 
        awareness and prevention programs to students throughout the 
        year.
