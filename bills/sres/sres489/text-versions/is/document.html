                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             June 26, 2014

                               RESOLUTION


 
     Supporting the goals and ideals of ``Growth Awareness Week''.

Whereas, according to the Pictures of Standard Syndromes and Undiagnosed 
        Malformations database (commonly known as the ``POSSUM'' database), more 
        than 600 serious diseases and health conditions cause growth failure;
Whereas health conditions that cause growth failure may affect the overall 
        health of a child;
Whereas short stature may be a symptom of a serious underlying health condition;
Whereas children with growth failure are often undiagnosed;
Whereas, according to the MAGIC Foundation for children's growth, 48 percent of 
        children in the United States who were evaluated for the 2 most common 
        causes of growth failure were undiagnosed with growth failure;
Whereas the longer a child with growth failure goes undiagnosed, the greater the 
        potential for damage and higher costs of care;
Whereas early detection and a diagnosis of growth failure are crucial to ensure 
        a healthy future for a child with growth failure;
Whereas raising public awareness of, and educating the public about, growth 
        failure is a vital public service;
Whereas providing resources for identification of growth failure will allow for 
        early detection; and
Whereas the MAGIC Foundation for children's growth has designated the third week 
        of September as ``Growth Awareness Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the third week of September 2014 as ``Growth 
        Awareness Week''; and
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``Growth Awareness 
        Week''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
