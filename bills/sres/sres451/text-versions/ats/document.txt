                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recalling the Government of China's forcible dispersion of those 
   peaceably assembled in Tiananmen Square 25 years ago, in light of 
             China's continued abysmal human rights record.

Whereas, in 1989, Chinese citizens involved in a peaceful democratic movement 
        gathered in Tiananmen Square to call for the establishment of a dialogue 
        with their government on democratic reforms, including freedom of 
        expression and freedom of assembly;
Whereas, on June 4, 1989, Chinese authorities ordered the People's Liberation 
        Army and other security forces to use lethal force to disperse 
        demonstrators in Tiananmen Square;
Whereas the number of peaceful protesters killed or injured by the forcible 
        dispersion remains unknown to this day;
Whereas, 25 years after these deaths, there has been no accountability on the 
        part of the Government of the People's Republic of China in disciplining 
        involved officials;
Whereas there remain imprisoned to this day individuals who expressed their 
        desire for democracy in China 25 years ago in Tiananmen Square;
Whereas the Department of State's most recent human rights report on China found 
        that ``citizens did not have the right to change their government'';
Whereas, even in recent weeks, the Government of the People's Republic of China 
        has detained those who attempt to peacefully commemorate the events of 
        June 1989, including activists such as Pu Zhiqiang and Wen Kejian;
Whereas the Department of State's most recent human rights report on China found 
        ``extrajudicial killings'' remained a problem in China;
Whereas the Department of State's most recent human rights report on China found 
        the government continued to target ``for arbitrary detention or arrest'' 
        ``human rights activists, journalists . . . and former political 
        prisoners and their family members''; and
Whereas June 4, 2014, is the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses sympathy to the families of those killed, 
        tortured, and imprisoned as a result of their participation in 
        the democracy gathering on June 4, 1989, in Tiananmen Square, 
        Beijing, in the People's Republic of China;
            (2) commends all peaceful advocates for democracy and human 
        rights in China;
            (3) condemns the ongoing and egregious human rights abuses 
        by the Communist Government of the People's Republic of China;
            (4) calls on the Communist Government of the People's 
        Republic of China to--
                    (A) release all prisoners of conscience, including 
                those persons still in prison as a result of their 
                participation in the peaceful pro-democracy gatherings 
                of 1989 and those detained for their commemoration of 
                these events;
                    (B) allow those people exiled on account of their 
                activities to return to live in freedom in China; and
                    (C) cease the harassment, detention, and 
                imprisonment of all Chinese citizens exercising their 
                freedoms of expression, association, and religion; and
            (5) calls upon the United States representative at the 
        United Nations Human Rights Council to introduce a resolution 
        in that forum calling for an examination of the human rights 
        practices of the Government of the People's Republic of China.
                                 <all>
