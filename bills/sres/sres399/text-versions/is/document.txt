                               RESOLUTION


 
             Expressing support for the American GI Forum.

Whereas millions of Hispanic veterans returning home from World War II were 
        segregated from other veterans groups and wrongfully denied services by 
        the United States Department of Veterans Affairs;
Whereas in response to such inequities, Hector P. Garcia, a United States Army 
        veteran and physician from Corpus Christi, Texas, founded the American 
        GI Forum (AGIF) on March 26, 1948;
Whereas the motto of AGIF is ``Education is our Freedom and Freedom Should be 
        Everybody's Business'';
Whereas in 1998, AGIF was granted a Federal charter pursuant to an Act of 
        Congress (Public Law 105-231);
Whereas one of the purposes stated in the AGIF charter is ``fostering and 
        enlarging equal educational opportunities, equal economic opportunities, 
        equal justice under the law, and equal political opportunities for all 
        United States citizens, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or 
        national origin'';
Whereas the flagship Veterans Service Center of the AGIF National Veterans 
        Outreach Program is based in San Antonio, Texas, and provides a 
        ``continuum of care'' to veterans in need, including employment 
        training, counseling, and a homeless veterans reintegration program;
Whereas the AGIF Residential Center for Homeless Veterans has 80 transitional 
        beds and 60 single-room apartments dedicated to the needs of our 
        Nation's homeless veterans;
Whereas AGIF is now the largest federally chartered Hispanic veterans 
        organization in the United States, with chapters in 40 States and Puerto 
        Rico; and
Whereas AGIF continues to be a beacon of hope and an avenue for community 
        involvement for returning veterans: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports and commends the mission, goals, and ideals of 
        the American GI Forum and its members; and
            (2) encourages others to join with the American GI Forum to 
        ensure that veterans are never again denied the benefits they 
        have earned through their service.
                                 <all>
