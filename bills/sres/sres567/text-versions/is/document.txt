                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the possible easing of 
restrictions on the sale of lethal military equipment to the Government 
                              of Vietnam.

    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) Vietnam is an important emerging partner with which the 
        United States increasingly shares strategic and economic 
        interests, including improving bilateral and multilateral 
        capacity for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, 
        upholding the principles of freedom of navigation and peaceful 
        resolution of international disputes, strengthening an open 
        regional trading order, and maintaining a favorable balance of 
        power in the Asia-Pacific region;
            (2) the Government of Vietnam has recently taken modest but 
        encouraging steps to improve its human rights record, including 
        signing the United Nations Convention Against Torture and other 
        Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted by 
        the United Nations General Assembly December 10, 1984, 
        increasing registrations for places of worship, taking greater 
        action to combat human trafficking, reviewing the Criminal 
        Code, and beginning high-level engagement with the United 
        States and international human rights nongovernmental 
        organizations;
            (3) in light of growing challenges in the Asia-Pacific 
        region and some steps by the Government of Vietnam to improve 
        its human rights record, the President should begin a process 
        to ease the United States prohibition on the sale of lethal 
        military equipment to Vietnam, which is maintained under 
        executive authority and can be changed without legislative 
        action, but should not be changed without consultation with 
        Congress;
            (4) easing the prohibition on the sale of lethal military 
        equipment to Vietnam at this time solely with regard to 
        maritime and coastal defense would further United States 
        national security interests, but steps beyond this to ease 
        further the prohibition would require the Government of Vietnam 
        to take significant and sustained steps to protect human 
        rights, including releases of prisoners of conscience and legal 
        reforms;
            (5) the United States Government should continue to support 
        civil society in Vietnam, including advocates for religious 
        freedom, press freedom, and labor rights who seek to use 
        peaceful means to build a strong and prosperous Vietnam that 
        respects human rights and the rule of law; and
            (6) the United States Government should continue to engage 
        the Government of Vietnam in a high-level dialogue and specify 
        what steps on human rights would be necessary for the 
        Government of Vietnam to take in order to continue 
        strengthening the bilateral relationship, including to ease 
        further the prohibition on the sale of lethal military 
        equipment.
                                 <all>
