_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
       Designating January 2014 as ``National Mentoring Month''.

Whereas the goals of National Mentoring Month are to raise awareness of 
        mentoring, recruit individuals to volunteer as mentors, and encourage 
        organizations to engage and integrate quality mentoring into their 
        efforts;
Whereas mentoring is a longstanding tradition in which a dependable, caring 
        adult provides guidance, support, and encouragement to facilitate the 
        social, emotional, and cognitive development of a young person;
Whereas a mentor is a caring, consistent presence who devotes time to a young 
        person to help that young person discover personal strength and achieve 
        their potential through a structured and trusting relationship;
Whereas research on mentoring shows that formal, high-quality mentoring programs 
        focused on developing the competence and character of mentees promote 
        positive outcomes, such as improved academic achievement, self-esteem, 
        social skills, and career development;
Whereas research shows that young people who are matched with a caring adult 
        through a quality mentoring program are 46 percent less likely to use 
        illegal drugs, 27 percent less likely to start drinking, 52 percent less 
        likely to skip school, 37 percent less likely to skip class, and are 
        more trusting of their parents or guardians;
Whereas more than 5,000 mentoring programs in communities of all sizes across 
        the United States focus on building strong, effective relationships 
        between mentors and mentees;
Whereas approximately 3,000,000 young people in the United States are in formal 
        mentoring relationships due to the remarkable vigor, creativity, and 
        resourcefulness of the thousands of mentoring programs in communities 
        throughout the United States;
Whereas in spite of the progress made to increase mentoring, the United States 
        has a serious ``mentoring gap'', with nearly 15,000,000 young people in 
        need of mentors;
Whereas, in 2012, 399,546 children were in foster care in the United States, 
        many of whom were without a mentor and 26,000 of whom ``aged out'' of 
        foster care by reaching adulthood without being placed in a permanent 
        home;
Whereas mentor programs that serve foster children are unique and require 
        additional considerations, including specialized training and support 
        necessary to provide for consistent, meaningful, and long-term 
        relationships for children in foster care;
Whereas mentoring is a proven cost-effective investment;
Whereas for every dollar invested in mentoring, there is a 3 dollar return to 
        society;
Whereas mentoring partnerships between the public and private sectors bring 
        State and local leaders together to support mentoring programs by 
        preventing duplication of efforts, offering training in industry best 
        practices, and making the most of limited resources to benefit young 
        people in the United States;
Whereas the designation of January 2014 as ``National Mentoring Month'' will 
        call attention to the critical role mentors play in helping young people 
        realize their potential; and
Whereas a month-long celebration of mentoring will encourage more individuals 
        and organizations, including schools, businesses, nonprofit 
        organizations, faith institutions, and foundations, to become engaged in 
        mentoring and close the mentoring gap in the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the month of January 2014 as ``National 
        Mentoring Month'';
            (2) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the 
        millions of caring adults and students who are already serving 
        as mentors and encourages more adults and students to volunteer 
        as mentors;
            (3) supports the goals of mentoring to increase educational 
        achievement, reduce juvenile delinquency, and improve life 
        outcomes for mentees; and
            (4) promotes the creation and expansion of quality 
        mentoring programs across the country to equip more young 
        people with the tools needed to lead healthy and productive 
        lives.
