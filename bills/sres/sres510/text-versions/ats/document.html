Whereas, in 1954, the first Newport Jazz Festival featured icons of American 
        jazz such as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Dizzie Gillespie;
Whereas the Newport Jazz Festival has provided some of the most memorable 
        moments in jazz history, including the Duke Ellington Orchestra's 1956 
        performance of ``Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue'', featuring a 27-
        chorus saxophone solo by Paul Gonsalves;
Whereas the ongoing mission of the Newport Jazz Festival is to celebrate jazz 
        music and to make the case for its relevance;
Whereas the Newport Jazz Festival has become a world-renowned event featuring 
        established and emerging artists and bringing together music lovers, 
        musicians, academics, and critics;
Whereas for the past 60 years, the Newport Jazz Festival and the Newport Folk 
        Festival have made a difference in the cultural life of the people of 
        the United States and have provided a soundtrack of freedom for 
        generations; and
Whereas, from August 1, 2014, through August 3, 2014, thousands of people will 
        come together in Newport, Rhode Island, to celebrate the 60th Newport 
        Jazz Festival: Now, therefore, be it

        people in the United States; and
            (3) recognizes the musicians, sponsors, volunteers, and the
