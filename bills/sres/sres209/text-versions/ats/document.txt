                               RESOLUTION


 
 Remembering the anniversary of the tragic shooting on August 5, 2012, 
        at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.

Whereas, on Sunday, August 5, 2012, a shooting took place at the Sikh Temple of 
        Wisconsin in Oak Creek, Wisconsin;
Whereas 6 innocent people of the United States, including one woman and 5 men, 
        lost their lives on that day in a senseless and violent act of hate at a 
        house of worship;
Whereas 3 people sustained serious injuries, including Lieutenant Brian Murphy, 
        the first responding officer;
Whereas many members of the Sikh community and the community as a whole 
        selflessly sought to aid and protect others by putting their own safety 
        at risk;
Whereas the heroic action of law enforcement officers such as Officer Sam Lenda 
        prevented additional loss of life; and
Whereas the Sikh community has responded to the shooting in a peaceful manner 
        consistent with the Sikh religious tenets of peace and equality: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) remembers the anniversary of the tragic shooting on 
        August 5, 2012, at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek, 
        Wisconsin;
            (2) condemns in the strongest possible terms that horrific 
        shooting;
            (3) condemns hatred and acts of violence towards racial and 
        religious groups and calls for renewed efforts to end that 
        violence;
            (4) honors the memory of Suveg Singh Khattra, Satwant Singh 
        Kaleka, Ranjit Singh, Sita Singh, Paramjit Kaur, and Prakash 
        Singh, who died in the shooting;
            (5) offers heartfelt condolences to the families, friends, 
        and loved ones of those who died in the shooting;
            (6) commends the heroism of first responders, and members 
        of the community who courageously and selflessly placed their 
        lives in danger to prevent the death of more innocent people; 
        and
            (7) stands with those who plan to gather in Oak Creek on 
        August 2 through August 5, 2013, to memorialize the lives lost 
        in the shooting and to continue healing as a community.
                                 <all>
