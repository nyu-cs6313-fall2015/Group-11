                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the Senate that all incidents of abusive, 
 unsanitary, or illegal health care practices should be condemned and 
prevented and the perpetrators should be prosecuted to the full extent 
                              of the law.

Whereas in recent years there have been rare and tragic incidents of willful 
        violations of law, human dignity, and standards of care across a variety 
        of health care settings that have exposed trusting patients to death and 
        disease, and shocked the conscience of the United States, including--

    (1) a physician at the Women's Medical Society of Philadelphia who is 
rightfully facing multiple criminal charges related to horrific practices;

    (2) health care practitioners at the Endoscopy Center of Southern 
Nevada who exposed 40,000 patients to hepatitis C through unsanitary 
practices;

    (3) an Oklahoma dentist who exposed as many as 7,000 patients to HIV 
and hepatitis B and C through unsanitary practices; and

    (4) a nursing director at Kern Valley nursing home in California who, 
for her own convenience, inappropriately medicated patients using 
antipsychotic drugs, resulting in the death of at least 1 patient: Now, 
therefore, be it

    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that all incidents of 
abusive, unsanitary, or illegal health care practices should be 
condemned and prevented and the perpetrators should be prosecuted to 
the full extent of the law.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
