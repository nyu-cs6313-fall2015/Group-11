                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             June 26, 2013

  Mr. Johanns (for himself, Mrs. Fischer, and Mr. Kirk) submitted the 
        following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing June 30, 2013, as the centennial of the Lincoln Highway, 
  the first transcontinental highway, which originally spanned 3,389 
    miles through 13 states, including the great State of Nebraska.

Whereas Carl G. Fisher, creator of the Lincoln Highway, believed this project 
        would ``stimulate as nothing else could the building of enduring 
        highways everywhere that will not only be a credit to the American 
        people but that will also mean much to American agriculture and American 
        commerce;''
Whereas, on October 31, 1913, this great highway became the first national 
        memorial to the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln;
Whereas the Lincoln Highway brought economic development, tourism, and adventure 
        to every community it touched;
Whereas, on June 22, 2013, hundreds of motorists will participate in the Lincoln 
        Highway Centennial Auto Tour, which will start simultaneously from the 
        bustling streets of New York's Time Square in the East and from San 
        Francisco's serene Lincoln Park in the West;
Whereas a centennial celebration will take place from June 30, 2013, through 
        July 1, 2013, when Lincoln Highway tour motorists will join at the 
        central meeting place of Kearney, Nebraska, which is precisely 1,733 
        miles from both the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts;
Whereas the Lincoln Highway served as a model and an inspiration for President 
        Dwight D. Eisenhower's grand initiative for a national highway system to 
        connect every person in the United States; and
Whereas the Lincoln Highway, more affectionately known as ``America's Main 
        Street'', will continue to be a symbol of Americana and the sense of 
        freedom that comes from driving on the open road: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes June 30, 2013, as the centennial of the 
        Lincoln Highway;
            (2) commemorates the important role that the Lincoln 
        Highway has played in significant historical and cultural 
        events in the United States; and
            (3) recognizes the economic growth, modernization in 
        infrastructure, and rural development that resulted from the 
        Lincoln Highway.
