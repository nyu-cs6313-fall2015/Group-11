  <summary>12/10/2014--Introduced.
Condemns the mass murder in Indonesia in 1965-1966.

Expresses concern about the lack of accountability enjoyed by those who carried out crimes during this period.

Urges political leaders in Indonesia to consider a truth, justice, and reconciliation commission to address alleged crimes against humanity and other human rights violations related to such mass killing.

Calls on the Department of State, the Department of Defense (DOD), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and others involved in developing and implementing policy towards Indonesia during such period to establish an interagency working group to: (1) locate and make available to the public all classified records and documents related to such mass killings, and (2) report to Congress.</summary>
