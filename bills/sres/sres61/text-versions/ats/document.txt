                               RESOLUTION


 
       Designating March 1, 2013, as ``Read Across America Day''.

Whereas reading is a basic requirement for quality education and professional 
        success, and is a source of pleasure throughout life;
Whereas the people of the United States must be able to read if the United 
        States is to remain competitive in the global economy;
Whereas Congress has placed great emphasis on reading intervention and on 
        providing additional resources for reading assistance, including through 
        the programs authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
        1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) and through annual appropriations for 
        library and literacy programs; and
Whereas more than 50 national organizations concerned about reading and 
        education have joined with the National Education Association to 
        designate March 1, the day before the anniversary of the birth of 
        Theodor Geisel (also known as Dr. Seuss), as a day to celebrate reading: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 1, 2013, as ``Read Across America 
        Day'';
            (2) honors Theodor Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss, for his 
        success in encouraging children to discover the joy of reading;
            (3) honors the 16th anniversary of ``Read Across America 
        Day'';
            (4) encourages parents to read with their children for at 
        least 30 minutes on ``Read Across America Day'' in honor of the 
        commitment of the Senate to building a country of readers; and
            (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``Read Across America Day'' with appropriate ceremonies and 
        activities.
                                 <all>
