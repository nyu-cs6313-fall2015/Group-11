 Designating October 17, 2014, as ``National Alternative Fuel Vehicle 
                                 Day''.

Whereas the United States should reduce dependence on foreign oil and enhance 
        energy security by creating a transportation sector that is less 
        dependent on oil;
Whereas the United States should improve air quality in the United States by 
        reducing emissions from the millions of motor vehicles that operate in 
        the United States;
Whereas the United States should foster national expertise and technological 
        advancement in cleaner, more energy-efficient alternative fuel and 
        advanced technology vehicles;
Whereas a robust domestic industry for alternative fuels and alternative fuel 
        and advanced technology vehicles will create jobs and increase the 
        competitiveness of the United States in the international community;
Whereas the people of the United States need more options for clean and energy-
        efficient transportation;
Whereas mainstream adoption of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles 
        will produce benefits at the local, national, and international levels;
Whereas consumers and businesses require a better understanding of the benefits 
        of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles;
Whereas first responders require proper comprehensive training to be fully 
        prepared for any precautionary measures that they may need to take 
        during incidents and extrications that involve alternative fuel and 
        advanced technology vehicles;
Whereas the Federal Government can lead the way toward a cleaner and more 
        efficient transportation sector by choosing alternative fuel and 
        advanced technology vehicles for the fleets of the Federal Government; 
        and
Whereas Federal support for the adoption of alternative fuel and advanced 
        technology vehicles can accelerate greater energy independence for the 
        United States, improve the environmental security of the United States, 
        and address global climate change: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates October 17, 2014, as ``National Alternative 
        Fuel Vehicle Day'';
            (2) proclaims National Alternative Fuel Vehicle Day as a 
        day to promote programs and activities that will lead to the 
        greater use of cleaner, more efficient transportation that uses 
        new sources of energy; and
            (3) urges the people of the United States to--
                    (A) increase personal and commercial use of cleaner 
                and more energy-efficient alternative fuel and advanced 
                technology vehicles;
                    (B) promote public sector adoption of cleaner and 
                more energy-efficient alternative fuel and advanced 
                technology vehicles; and
                    (C) encourage the adoption of Federal policies to 
                advance and adopt alternative, advanced, and emerging 
                vehicle and fuel technologies in order to reduce the 
                dependence of the United States on foreign oil.
