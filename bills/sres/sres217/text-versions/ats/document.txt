Expressing support for designation of October 6, 2013, through October 
10, 2013, as ``American College of Surgeons Days'' and recognizing the 
         100th anniversary of the founding of the organization.

Whereas the American College of Surgeons is the largest surgical organization in 
        the world and remains steadfast in its mission to improve the care of 
        the surgical patient and to safeguard standards of care in an optimal 
        and ethical practice environment;
Whereas the American College of Surgeons continues its work into the 21st 
        century to sustain and develop relevant programs that are inspired by 
        quality;
Whereas the 100th anniversary celebrations serve as a testament that the 
        American College of Surgeons is fulfilling its mission of engaging 
        surgeons as leaders and educators, and developing initiatives that 
        improve surgery and the quality of care for surgical patients;
Whereas the 2013 American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress is the most 
        prestigious international surgical conference, bringing together 
        thousands of Fellows of the College and other health care professionals 
        who each year rely on the Clinical Congress to learn about the latest 
        surgical advances, practice management methods, and health policy 
        issues; and
Whereas October 6, 2013, through October 10, 2013, would be appropriate dates to 
        designate as ``American College of Surgeons Days'' to celebrate the 
        100th anniversary of the founding of the American College of Surgeons, 
        the achievements of which continue to significantly influence the course 
        of surgery in the United States and around the world, and which was 
        established as an advocate for all surgical patients: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of ``American College of 
        Surgeons Days'';
            (2) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the founding of the 
        American College of Surgeons; and
            (3) recognizes the many important contributions of the 
        American College of Surgeons to the welfare of surgical 
        patients and the health care system of the United States.
