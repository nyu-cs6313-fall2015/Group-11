                               RESOLUTION


 
       Designating March 3, 2014, as ``Read Across America Day''.

Whereas reading is a basic requirement for quality education and professional 
        success, and is a source of pleasure throughout life;
Whereas the people of the United States must be able to read if the United 
        States is to remain competitive in the global economy;
Whereas Congress has placed great emphasis on reading intervention and providing 
        additional resources for reading assistance, including through the 
        programs authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
        1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) and through annual appropriations for 
        library and literacy programs; and
Whereas more than 50 national organizations concerned about reading and 
        education have joined with the National Education Association to 
        designate March 3, the day after the anniversary of the birth of Theodor 
        Geisel (also known as ``Dr. Seuss''), as a day to celebrate reading: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 3, 2014, as ``Read Across America 
        Day'';
            (2) honors Theodor Geisel (also known as ``Dr. Seuss'') for 
        his success in encouraging children to discover the joy of 
        reading;
            (3) honors the 17th anniversary of Read Across America Day;
            (4) encourages parents to read with their children for at 
        least 30 minutes on Read Across America Day in honor of the 
        commitment of the Senate to building a country of readers; and
            (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Read Across America Day with appropriate ceremonies and 
        activities.
                                 <all>
