        July 2008, and since that date, Saint Louis has become widely recognized

Whereas chess promotes problem-solving, higher-level thinking skills, and 
        improved self-esteem;
Whereas the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis brings the 
        educational benefits of chess to thousands of students in more than 100

        program to create a sustainable network of participating after-school

        United States to engage in chess programs to promote problem-
        solving, critical thinking, spatial awareness, and goal
