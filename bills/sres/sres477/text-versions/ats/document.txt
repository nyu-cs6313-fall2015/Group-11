 Designating June 20, 2014, as ``American Eagle Day'', and celebrating 
the recovery and restoration of the bald eagle, the national symbol of 
                           the United States.

Whereas on June 20, 1782, the bald eagle was officially designated as the

Whereas the bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of--

    (1) the spirit of freedom; and

    (2) the sovereignty of the United States;

Whereas since the founding of the Nation, the image, meaning, and symbolism of 
        the bald eagle have played a significant role in the art, music, 
        history, commerce, literature, architecture, and culture of the United 
        States;
Whereas the bald eagle is prominently featured on the stamps, currency, and 
        coinage of the United States;
Whereas the habitat of bald eagles exists only in North America;
Whereas by 1963, the population of bald eagles that nested in the lower 48 
        States had declined to approximately 417 nesting pairs;
Whereas due to the dramatic decline in the population of bald eagles in the 
        lower 48 States, the Secretary of the Interior listed the bald eagle as 
        an endangered species on the list of endangered species published under 
        section 4(c)(1) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
        1533(c)(1));
Whereas caring and concerned individuals from the Federal, State, and private 
        sectors banded together to save, and help ensure the recovery and 
        protection of, bald eagles;
Whereas on July 20, 1969, the first manned lunar landing occurred in the Apollo 
        11 Lunar Excursion Module, which was named ``Eagle'';
Whereas the ``Eagle'' played an integral role in achieving the goal of the 
        United States of landing a man on the Moon and returning that man safely 
        to Earth;
Whereas in 1995, as a result of the efforts of those caring and concerned 
        individuals, the Secretary of the Interior listed the bald eagle as a 
        threatened species on the list of threatened species published under 
        section 4(c)(1) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
        1533(c)(1));
Whereas by 2007, the population of bald eagles that nested in the lower 48 
        States had increased to approximately 10,000 nesting pairs, an increase 
        of approximately 2,500 percent from the preceding 40 years;
Whereas in 2007, the population of bald eagles that nested in the State of 
        Alaska was approximately 50,000 to 70,000;
Whereas on June 28, 2007, the Secretary of the Interior removed the bald eagle 
        from the list of threatened species published under section 4(c)(1) of 
        the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(1));
Whereas bald eagles remain protected in accordance with--

    (1) the Act entitled ``An Act for the protection of the bald eagle'', 
approved June 8, 1940 (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.) (commonly known as the ``Bald 
Eagle Protection Act of 1940''); and

    (2) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.);

Whereas on January 15, 2008, the Secretary of the Treasury issued 3 limited 
        edition bald eagle commemorative coins under the American Bald Eagle 
        Recovery and National Emblem Commemorative Coin Act (Public Law 108-486; 
        118 Stat. 3934);
Whereas the sale of the limited edition bald eagle commemorative coins issued by 
        the Secretary of the Treasury has raised approximately $7,800,000 for 
        the nonprofit American Eagle Foundation of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee to 
        support efforts to protect the bald eagle;
Whereas if not for the vigilant conservation efforts of concerned Americans and 
        the enactment of conservation laws (including regulations), the bald 
        eagle would face extinction;
Whereas the American Eagle Foundation has brought substantial public attention 
        to the cause of the protection and care of the bald eagle nationally;
Whereas, November 4, 2010, marked the 25th anniversary of the American Eagle 
        Foundation;
Whereas facilities around the United States, such as the Southeastern Raptor 
        Center at Auburn University in the State of Alabama, rehabilitate 
        injured eagles for release into the wild;
Whereas the dramatic recovery of the population of bald eagles--

    (1) is an endangered species success story; and

    (2) an inspirational example for other wildlife and natural resource 
conservation efforts around the world;

Whereas the initial recovery of the population of bald eagles was accomplished 
        by the concerted efforts of numerous government agencies, corporations, 
        organizations, and individuals; and
Whereas the continuation of recovery, management, and public awareness programs 
        for bald eagles will be necessary to ensure--

    (1) the continued progress of the recovery of bald eagles; and

    (2) that the population and habitat of bald eagles will remain healthy 
and secure for future generations: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 20, 2014, as ``American Eagle Day'';
            (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins 
        by the Secretary of the Treasury as a means by which to 
        generate critical funds for the protection of bald eagles; and
            (3) encourages--
                    (A) educational entities, organizations, 
                businesses, conservation groups, and government 
                agencies with a shared interest in conserving 
                endangered species to collaborate and develop 
                educational tools for use in the public schools of the 
                United States; and
                    (B) the people of the United States to observe 
                American Eagle Day with appropriate ceremonies and 
                other activities.
