                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against the Islamic 
                  State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has committed acts of 
        terrorism and crimes against humanity and continues to train and equip 
        jihadists to further commit humanitarian atrocities in the region;
Whereas ISIL jihadists have directly threatened the United States and its 
        allies;
Whereas ISIL poses a direct threat to United States personnel in Iraq and to the 
        immediate security and stability of the Middle East region;
Whereas, on August 8, 2014, United States Armed Forces conducted airstrikes in 
        Iraq as authorized by the President, consistent with the requirements of 
        the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148);
Whereas the War Powers Resolution requires the President to obtain congressional 
        authorization for the continued use of United States Armed Forces after 
        the limitations specified in section 5(b) of such Resolution have been 
        met;
Whereas Congress, in order to determine the actions necessary and appropriate to 
        protect the national security interests of the United States, must 
        receive a strategic outlook on the role of United States Armed Forces in 
        combating ISIL;
Whereas the President has authority under the Constitution to take action in 
        order to deter and prevent acts of international terrorism against the 
        United States, as Congress recognized in the Authorization for Use of 
        Military Force (Public Law 107-40); and
Whereas it is in the national security interest of the United States to restore 
        international peace and security to the Middle East region: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,
