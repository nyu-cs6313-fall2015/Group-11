    "text": "Division A: Bipartisan Budget Agreement - Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 - Division A [sic]: Budget Enforcement and Deficit Reduction - Title I: Budget Enforcement - Subtitle A: Amendments to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act - (Sec. 101) Amends the Balanced Budget Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act) to establish (increased) discretionary spending limits (spending caps) for the revised security and nonsecurity categories for FY2014-FY2015. Continues the existing spending limits in such categories for FY2016-FY2021 imposed under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA). (Pursuant to BCA procedures, the initial limits for FY2014-FY2021 are to be lowered (sequestered) by the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] each fiscal year to achieve certain budgetary savings.)\n\nAmends the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to direct OMB to make the calculations necessary to implement the direct defense and nondefense spending reductions calculated pursuant to the BCA without regard to this Act's revisions of the discretionary spending limits for FY2014-FY2015.\n\nDirects the President, upon issuance of OMB sequestration preview reports for FY2022-FY2023, to order a sequestration, effective upon issuance so that the percentage reductions for nonexempt direct spending for the defense and nondefense functions are the same percent as the corresponding percentage reductions for such spending for FY2021.\n\nMakes conforming amendments to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to define:\n\n \"revised security category\" as discretionary appropriations in budget function 050, \"revised nonsecurity category\" as discretionary appropriations other than in budget function 050, and \"category\" as the subsets of these discretionary appropriations. Requires:\n\n discretionary appropriations in each of the categories to be those designated in the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the Balanced Budget Act of 1997; and new accounts or activities to be categorized only after consultation with congressional appropriations and budget committees, and to the extent practicable, to include written communication to those committees that affords them the opportunity to comment before official action is taken for such accounts or activities. Subtitle B: Establishing a Congressional Budget - (Sec. 111) Sets forth the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2014, including appropriate budgetary levels for FY2015-FY2023.\n\nRequires the Chairmen of the congressional budget committees to submit statements for publication in the Congressional Record as soon as practicable after enactment of this Act that include:\n\n committee allocations for the Committee on Appropriations of the respective chamber for FY2014 consistent with the discretionary spending limits set forth in this Act; committee allocations for all other committees of the respective chamber for: (1) FY2014, (2) FY2014-FY2018 in the Senate only, and (3) FY2014-FY2023; aggregate spending levels for FY2014 in accordance with such allocations; aggregate revenue levels for: (1) FY2014, (2) FY2014-FY2018 in the Senate only, and (3) FY2014-FY2023; and in the Senate only, levels of Social Security revenues and outlays for FY2014-FY2023 consistent with the CBO May 2013 baseline adjusted to account for the budgetary effects of this Act and legislation enacted before this Act but not included in such baseline. Authorizes the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, after enactment of this Act, to reduce the aggregates, allocations, and other budgetary levels included in the Chairman's statement to reflect the budgetary effects of any legislation enacted during the 113th Congress that reduces the deficit.\n\n(Sec. 112) Makes it out of order to consider in the Senate any legislation that would require advanced appropriations, except by a supermajority waiver, other than for:\n\n up to $28.852 billion in new budget authority in FY2015-FY2016 for programs, projects, activities, or accounts identified in the joint explanatory statement of managers accompanying this budget resolution; the Corporation for Public Broadcasting; and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for the Medical Services, Medical Support and Compliance, and Medical Facilities accounts of the Veterans Health Administration. Makes this requirement inapplicable if a budget resolution for FY2015 is adopted in both chambers.\n\n(Sec. 113) Provides that, for the remainder of the 113th Congress in the House of Representatives, the provisions of H.Con.Res. 25 (113th Congress), as deemed in force by H.Res. 243 (113th Congress), shall remain in force to the extent its budgetary levels are not superseded by this subtitle or by further action of the House.\n\n(Sec. 114) Requires the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee (Chairman in this section), for enforcement of the Senate Pay-As-You-Go Scorecard requirements, to: (1) reduce any balances of direct spending and revenues for any fiscal year to zero, effective upon enactment of this joint resolution; and (2) do the same for FY2015 between April 15 and May 15, 2014.\n\nAuthorizes the Chairman to revise the committee allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits set pursuant to this subtitle for any legislation that amends the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to repeal or revise the enforcement procedures established under it, by the amounts provided in that legislation for those purposes, provided that it would not increase the deficit over the FY2014-FY2023 total.
