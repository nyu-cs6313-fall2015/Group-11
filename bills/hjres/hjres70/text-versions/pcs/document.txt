    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United

    Sec. 101. (a) Such amounts as may be necessary, at a rate for 
operations as provided in the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 
2013 (division F of Public Law 113-6) and under the authority and 
conditions provided in such Act, for continuing projects or activities 
(including the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees) that are not 
otherwise specifically provided for in this joint resolution, that were 
conducted in fiscal year 2013, and for which appropriations, funds, or 
other authority were made available by such Act under the following

            (4) ``National Gallery of Art''.
    (b) The rate for operations provided by subsection (a) for each 
account shall be calculated to reflect the full amount of any reduction 
required in fiscal year 2013 pursuant to--
            (1) any provision of division G of the Consolidated and 
        Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (Public Law 113-6), 
        including section 3004; and
            (2) the Presidential sequestration order dated March 1, 
        2013, except as attributable to budget authority made available 
        by the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 (Public Law 
        113-2).
    Sec. 102.  Appropriations made by section 101 shall be available to 
the extent and in the manner that would be provided by the pertinent

    Sec. 103.  Unless otherwise provided for in this joint resolution

the most limited funding action of that permitted in the joint 
resolution shall be taken in order to provide for continuation of 
projects and activities.
    Sec. 106.  Amounts made available under section 101 for civilian 
personnel compensation and benefits in each department and agency may 
be apportioned up to the rate for operations necessary to avoid 
furloughs within such department or agency, consistent with the 
applicable appropriations Act for fiscal year 2013, except that such 
authority provided under this section shall not be used until after the 
department or agency has taken all necessary actions to reduce or defer 
non-personnel-related administrative expenses.
    Sec. 107.  It is the sense of Congress that this joint resolution 
may also be referred to as the ``Open Our National Parks and Museums

United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Continuing Appropriations 
Resolution, 2014''.
