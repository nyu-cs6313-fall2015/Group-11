                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
Prohibiting the use of funds available to any United States Government 
department or agency for the use of force in, or directed at, Syria by 
                    the United States Armed Forces.

Whereas the Government of Syria has not declared war or initiated hostilities 
        against the United States or its allies; and
Whereas Article 1, Section 8, of the United States Constitution states that 
        Congress shall have the power ``To declare War'', ``To raise and support 
        Armies'', ``To provide and maintain a Navy'', and ``To make Rules for 
        the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces'': Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the American people and Congress do not support the use 
        of the United States Armed Forces in, or directed at, Syria; 
        and
            (2) there are not overriding imminent national security 
        interests of the United States at stake and Congress will not 
        fund any military action taken in contradiction to this joint 
        resolution.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR USE OF FORCE AGAINST SYRIA.

    No funds available to any United States Government department or 
agency may be used for the use of force in, or directed at, Syria by 
the United States Armed Forces unless a subsequent Act of Congress 
specifically authorizes such use of force or there is an attack or 
imminent attack on the United States, its territories or possessions, 
or the United States Armed Forces.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
