                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           September 19, 2014

 Mr. Larson of Connecticut introduced the following joint resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and in addition

 by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as 
        fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned

                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against the Islamic 
                     State of Iraq and the Levant.

Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has committed gruesome 
        atrocities in Iraq and Syria;
Whereas ISIL has been instigating sectarian violence that threatens the 
        stability of the Middle East region and the national security interest 
        of the United States;
Whereas ISIL has directly threatened the United States and has kidnapped and 
        killed United States citizens in Syria;
Whereas such acts continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
        national security and foreign policy of the United States;
Whereas such acts render it both necessary and appropriate that the United 
        States exercise its rights to self-defense and to protect United States 
        citizens both at home and abroad;
Whereas consistent with the War Powers Resolution (Public Law 93-148), the 
        President authorized a series of limited airstrikes in Iraq to protect 
        United States personnel and support certain humanitarian operations; and
Whereas continued use of the United States Armed Forces after the time 
        limitations specified in section 5(b) of the War Powers Act requires 
        authorization by the United States Congress: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization for Use 
of Military Force Against ISIL Resolution''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President has rightly committed limited forces in 
        Iraq to protect United States diplomatic and military personnel 
        against the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant 
        (``ISIL'');
            (2) the President should be commended for authorizing 
        military operations to protect ethnic and religious minorities 
        from slaughter at the hands of ISIL and for providing 
        assistance to prevent a humanitarian disaster;
            (3) the President should be commended for working with 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to form a coordinated 
        world response to the threat of ISIL;
            (4) if the President determines that it is necessary to use 
        the United States Armed Forces against ISIL, the President--
                    (A) should seek consensus in the United Nations 
                Security Council prior to pursuing a multilateral 
                military campaign against ISIL;
                    (B) should endeavor to form a coalition of allies 
                as broadly based as practicable to support and 
                participate with the United States Armed Forces; and
                    (C) should seek equal participation and assistance 
                from members of the Arab League; and
            (5) although military intervention might be necessary to 
        significantly disrupt and degrade ISIL's activities and 
        operational capabilities in Iraq and Syria, a negotiated 
        political solution among ethnic groups is the only sure 
        solution to end sectarian violence and reach permanent peace.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES IN 
              ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL 
              RESOLUTION.

    (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to use the United 
States Armed Forces as the President determines to be necessary and 
appropriate in order to--
            (1) defend the national security of the United States 
        against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (``ISIL''); 
        and
            (2) enforce a United Nations Security Council resolution 
        adopted on or after the date of the enactment of this joint 
        resolution that--
                    (A) provides for multilateral action against ISIL, 
                including sanctions, humanitarian assistance to those 
                affected by the violence, and the protection of 
                civilians, refugees, nongovernmental organization 
                workers and journalists; and
                    (B) authorizes a military force, formed by a 
                coalition of nations, including members of the Arab 
                League, under the auspices of the United Nations 
                Security Council for the individual and collective 
                self-defense against ISIL and to degrade its capacities 
                to commit terrorist acts, destabilize peaceful 
                governments, and perpetuate further attacks.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall be 
construed to prevent or otherwise limit the authority of the Armed 
Forces to use all appropriate force for self-defense and enforcement 
purposes.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES IN ABSENCE 
              OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION.

    (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to use the United 
States Armed Forces as the President determines to be necessary and 
appropriate to defend the national security of the United States 
against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (``ISIL''), other than 
the use of such Armed Forces in direct ground combat operations, if--
            (1) the President submits to the Speaker of the House of 
        Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate--
                    (A) a certification described in subsection (b); 
                and
                    (B) a strategy for the use of military force 
                against ISIL; and
            (2) a joint resolution that meets the requirements of a 
        qualifying resolution under section 5 is enacted into law.
    (b) Certification Described.--A certification described in this 
subsection is a certification that--
            (1)(A) the United States has sought adoption by the United 
        Nations Security Council of a resolution described in section 
        2(4), and the Security Council has failed to adopt such a 
        resolution, and no other action taken by the United Nations 
        Security Council has been sufficient to compel action against 
        ISIL; or
            (B) the United Nations Security Council has passed a 
        resolution that does not sanction the use of force, and--
                    (i) the United Nations Security Council is unlikely 
                to take further action that will result in authorizing 
                military action; and
                    (ii) the use of military force against ISIL is 
                necessary to combat its threat; and
            (2) the United States is in the process of establishing, or 
        has established, a coalition of other countries as broadly 
        based as practicable to support and participate with the United 
        States in any action that is taken against ISIL.
