                sole basis for the financial interest of the attorney 
                or law firm in the outcome of the action arises from an 
                agreement to provide that legal representation.
            ``(2) Joinder of interested parties.--In a civil action 
        arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, the 
        court shall grant a motion by a party defending an infringement 
        claim to join an interested party if the defending party shows

        the complaint, including a claim asserted in the complaint, is 
        limited primarily to asserting any such patent claim in 
        litigation.

                service of process; or
                    ``(B) joinder under paragraph (2) would deprive the 
                court of subject matter jurisdiction or make venue 
                improper.''.

SEC. 4. DISCOVERY LIMITS.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 29 of title 35, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 300. Discovery in patent infringement suits

        a civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to 
        patents, if the court determines that a ruling relating to the 
        construction of terms used in a patent claim asserted in the 
        complaint is required, discovery shall be limited, until such 
        ruling, to information necessary for the court to determine the 
        meaning of the terms used in the patent claim, including any 
        interpretation of those terms used to support the claim of 
        infringement.

                Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (Public Law 
                98-417)), resolution within a specified period of time 
                of a civil action arising under any Act of Congress 
                relating to patents will have an automatic impact upon 
                the rights of a party with respect to the patent, the 
                court may permit discovery in addition to the discovery 
                authorized under paragraph (1) before the ruling 
                described in paragraph (1) as necessary to ensure 
                timely resolution of the action.
                    ``(B) Resolution of motions.--When necessary to 
                resolve a motion properly raised by a party before a 
                ruling relating to the construction of terms (as 
                described in paragraph (1)), the court may allow 
                limited discovery in addition to the discovery 
                authorized under paragraph (1) as necessary to resolve 
                the motion.
