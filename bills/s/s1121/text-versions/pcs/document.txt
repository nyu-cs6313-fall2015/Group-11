                                 A BILL


 
  To stop the National Security Agency from spying on citizens of the 
                 United States and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fourth Amendment Restoration Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Bill of Rights states in the 4th Amendment to the 
        United States Constitution that ``The right of the people to be 
        secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against 
        unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and 
        no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by 
        Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to 
        be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.''.
            (2) Media reports indicate that the National Security 
        Agency is currently collecting the phone records of American 
        citizens.
            (3) Media reports indicate that the National Security 
        Agency has secured a top secret court order in April 2013 from 
        a court established under section 103 of the Foreign 
        Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1803) for the 
        telephone records of millions of American citizens.
            (4) Media reports indicate that President Barack Obama's 
        Administration has been collecting information about millions 
        of citizens within the borders of the United States and between 
        the United States and other countries.
            (5) The collection of citizen's phone records is a 
        violation of the natural rights of every man and woman in the 
        United States, and a clear violation of the explicit language 
        of the highest law of the land.

SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution shall not be construed to 
allow any agency of the United States Government to search the phone 
records of Americans without a warrant based on probable cause.
                                                        Calendar No. 83
