              LIMITING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

    (a) In General.--If the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency proposes a rule that limits greenhouse gas emissions 
and imposes increased costs on one or more other Federal agencies, the 
Administrator shall include in the proposed rule an offset from funds 
available to the Administrator for all projected increased costs that 
the proposed rule would impose on other Federal agencies.
    (b) No Offsets.--If the Administrator proposes a rule that limits

        payer of the Federal agency; and
            (2) the proposed rule--
                    (A) shall be considered to be a rule that imposes 
                increased costs on a Federal agency; and
