CHIP Extension Act of 2014 - Revises and extends through FY2019 at generally increased levels the program under title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance) (CHIP) of the Social Security Act (SSA), and adjusts CHIP allotment requirements accordingly, including the rebasing and growth factor update rules for computing state allotments.

Sets forth new requirements for the enrollment and retention of children for fiscal years after FY2014. Establishes in the Treasury the CHIP Shortfall Fund, which shall be available without further appropriations for payments to shortfall states whose projected CHIP expenditures for the fiscal year will exceed a specified amount.

Gives states the option to increase up to 26 the upper age limit for CHIP-eligible children with special health care needs.

Requires a state to establish procedures to eliminate gaps in coverage and to assist a child's and pregnant woman's transition: (1)&#160; from coverage under the state plan under SSA title XIX (Medicaid) or the state CHIP plan to coverage under a qualified health plan offered through an Exchange, and (2) from coverage under a qualified health plan to coverage under a state Medicaid or CHIP plan.

Directs the Secretary to develop comparability standards with respect to affordability, benefits, and network adequacy which qualified health plans offered by a state-established Exchange must meet to be certified for such transitions.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to minimum essential coverage for a targeted pregnant low-income woman under CHIP, to exclude from such coverage, at a woman's option, pregnancy-related assistance.

Provides automatic	enrollment under CHIP for newborns.

Amends SSA title XIX (Medicaid) to give states the option to extend express lane eligibility to pregnant women.

Makes permanent the express lane option and the CHIP outreach and enrollment grant program.

Requires a national campaign to increase enrollment in CHIP or Medicaid of children from families that speak a language other than English.

Limits to 5% of family income the total annual aggregate amount of any premium, enrollment fee, deduction or other cost sharing imposed under a Medicaid plan with respect to individuals and their families..

Amends SSA title XXI to prohibit cost-sharing for pregnancy-related assistance. Imposes under CHIP a certain limit on cost-sharing for dental-only supplemental coverage.

Amends SSA titles XIX and XXI to cover preventive services for children or pregnant women without cost-sharing.

Amends SSA title XIX to cover newly approved vaccines within 30 days after the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices approves them.

Treats CHIP-eligible children as federally vaccine-eligible children.

Makes permanent the program for the distribution of pediatric vaccines.

Amends SSA title XI to extend the pediatric quality measures program. Requires the Secretary to establish a program to continue and enhance pediatric quality measures program centers of excellence.

Revises requirements for initial core measures.

Directs the Secretary to convene a panel of health experts to establish priorities and goals for child health as recommended in a specified report by the Institute of Medicine.

Modifies and extends the Demonstration Projects for Improving the Quality of Children's Health Care and the Use of Health Information Technology.

Extends funding for Childhood Obesity Demonstration Projects and maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting programs.

Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to study each state in which individuals eligible for Medicaid or CHIP are provided such assistance through enrollment in a qualified health plan or employer-sponsored insurance.</summary>
