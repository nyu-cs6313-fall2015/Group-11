    "text": "Caller ID Scam Prevention Act of 2014 - Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to expand the prohibition on the provision of inaccurate caller identification information (which makes it unlawful to cause a caller identification service to knowingly transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information with the intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value) to persons outside the United States if the recipient is within the United States.\n\nRevises the definitions of \"caller identification information\" and \"caller identification service\" to include text messages sent using a text messaging service.\n\nDefines \"text message\" as real-time or near real-time messages consisting of text, images, sounds, or other information transmitted from or received by a device identified by a telephone number. Excludes from such definition a real-time, two-way voice or video communication.\n\nExpands the categories of IP-enabled voice services that are subject to such prohibition to include services with interconnection capability, whether part of a bundle of services or separately, that can originate traffic to the public switched telephone network."
