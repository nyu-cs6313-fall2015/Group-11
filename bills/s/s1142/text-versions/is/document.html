                                 A BILL


 
  To prohibit Members of Congress from receiving pay when the Federal 
 Government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because the 
                  public debt limit has been reached.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pay Your Bills or Lose Your Pay Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) It is an American value to meet all obligations.
            (2) A AAA credit rating is essential to the economic 
        standing of the United States in the world.
            (3) The statutory debt limit was increased--
                    (A) 18 times during the presidency of Ronald 
                Reagan;
                    (B) 5 times during the presidency of George H. W. 
                Bush;
                    (C) 6 times during the presidency of William J. 
                Clinton; and
                    (D) 7 times during the presidency of George W. 
                Bush.
            (4) Section 4 of the 14th Amendment of the United States 
        Constitution states ``the validity of the public debt of the 
        United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for 
        payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing 
        insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned''.
            (5) The statutory debt limit is increased by Congress to 
        pay financial obligations authorized by Congress.
            (6) The ratings agency Moody's has called for the public 
        debt limit to be eliminated.
            (7) The United States is one of the few nations in the 
        world with a public debt limit.
            (8) The annual budget resolution, voted on by members of 
        the Senate and House of Representatives, specifies the 
        appropriate level of the public debt for each fiscal year 
        covered by the resolution.
            (9) At times the statutory debt limit must be increased to 
        honor financial obligations authorized and appropriated by 
        Congress and the President of the United States.
            (10) The credit rating agency Standard and Poor's 
        downgraded the credit rating of the United States for the first 
        time in its history on August 5, 2011, citing ``political 
        brinksmanship'' as a primary reason for its action.
            (11) In July 2012, the Government Accountability Office 
        estimated that the 2011 debt limit standoff cost taxpayers 
        $1,300,000,000 in fiscal year 2011, and the Government 
        Accountability Office further noted that ``Congress should 
        consider ways to . . . avoid potential disruptions to the 
        Treasury market and to help inform the fiscal policy debate in 
        a timely way.''.
            (12) In January 2013, the Bipartisan Policy Center 
        estimated that the 10-year cost to taxpayers of the 2011 debt 
        limit standoff is $18,900,000,000.
