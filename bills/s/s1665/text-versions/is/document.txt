                                 A BILL


 
    To preserve the constitutional authority of Congress and ensure 
            accountability and transparency in legislation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Read the Bills Act''.

SEC. 2. CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY STATEMENT.

    (a) In General.--This Act is enacted pursuant to the power 
conferred by the Constitution of the United States upon each House of 
Congress by--
            (1) article I, section 5, clauses 2 and 3 to determine the 
        rules and keep a journal of its proceedings, respectively;
            (2) article I, section 7, clause 2 to ensure that bills 
        that become law have been actually passed by, not just passed 
        through, each House of Congress; and
            (3) article I, section 8, clause 18, which authorizes 
        Congress to make all laws that are necessary and proper for 
        carrying into execution the rules of each House of Congress.
    (b) Standing Provision.--The provision of this Act under which any 
person who is aggrieved by the enforcement of any law enacted either in 
violation of the rules of proceedings of either House of Congress, or 
by the suspension of the rules, as prescribed herein, shall have 
standing in a court of law, is enacted pursuant to article III, section 
2 of the Constitution of the United States.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Constitution of the United States vests all 
        legislative powers granted therein in Congress.
            (2) Each Member of Congress is elected by the people to 
        whom the Member is accountable, and Members must represent the 
        people of their respective State or District in exercising 
        their legislative powers.
            (3) Establishing a Government of enumerated powers, article 
        I, section 1 of the Constitution of the United States obliges 
        Congress to exercise only those legislative powers provided for 
        in the Constitution of the United States, and article VI of the 
        Constitution of the United States requires that each Member of 
        Congress be bound by oath or affirmation to support the 
        Constitution of the United States by enacting only those laws, 
        and making only those resolutions, that are pursuant to the 
        Constitution of the United States and not prohibited thereby.
            (4) To ensure that Congress is politically and legally 
        accountable to the people, article I, section 5 of the 
        Constitution of the United States requires each House of 
        Congress to keep a journal of its proceedings and from time to 
        time publish the same.
            (5) To ensure that no legislation is passed without 
        effective representation of the interests of the people by the 
        elected Members of Congress, article I, section 7 of the 
        Constitution of the United States provides that only a bill 
        ``which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the 
        Senate,'' and not vetoed by the President, shall ``become a 
        law''.
            (6) According to section I of the Manual of Parliamentary 
        Practice for the Use of the Senate of the United States, 
        written by Thomas Jefferson in 1801 (referred to in this 
        section as ``Jefferson's Manual''), ``nothing tended more to 
        throw power into the hands of administration and those who 
        acted with the majority . . . than a neglect of, or departure 
        from, the rules of proceeding [which] operated as a check and 
        control of the actions of the majority [and] a shelter and 
        protection to the minority''.
            (7) According to sections XXII and XL of Jefferson's 
        Manual, it was the rule of the Senate that every bill receive 3 
        readings, 2 full readings by the Clerk of the Senate, and a 
        third reading of the title of the bill only, because ``every 
        member of the Senate had a printed copy [of the bill] in his 
        hand.''.
            (8) According to sections XXIV, XXV, and XL of Jefferson's 
        Manual, it was the rule of the House of Representatives, 
        following the parliamentary procedure of the English House of 
        Commons, that every bill receive 2 full readings by the Clerk 
        of the House of Representatives, and a reading of the whole 
        contents of the bill verbatim by the Speaker of the House of 
        Representatives before the House of Representatives voted on 
        the bill.
            (9) Under the current rules of the Senate, the Senate has 
        departed from its original practice of a full first and second 
        reading of each bill, and of ensuring that each Senator has a 
        printed or other verbatim copy of each bill before passage 
        thereof, having by rule XIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate 
        limited each reading of a bill to the reading of the title of 
        the bill only, unless the Senate in any case shall otherwise 
        order.
            (10) Under the current rules of the House of 
        Representatives, the House of Representatives has by rule XVI 
        (8) and rule XVIII (5) embraced its original practice of full 
        first and second readings of each bill, but has regularly 
        departed from this practice by unanimous consent of the House 
        of Representatives, and has dispensed altogether its original 
        practice of a verbatim third reading of each bill before 
        passage, limiting such third reading to the reading of the 
        title only, including the reading of the title only even when 
        Members of the House of Representatives have no printed or 
        other verbatim copy of the bill before passage.
            (11) Although section 106 of title 1, United States Code, 
        requires a bill to be made available in written form to each 
        Member of Congress before final passage, Congress has by 
        statute conferred upon itself the power, during the last 6 days 
        of a session of Congress, by concurrent resolution, to vote for 
        passage of a bill that is not in written form at the time of 
        final passage.
            (12) As a direct consequence of the departure of the Senate 
        and the House of Representatives from the salutary practice of 
        full, verbatim readings of each bill before final passage, and 
        further, as a direct consequence of Congress, by concurrent 
        resolution and otherwise, having permitted certain 
        appropriation, budget, and regulatory bills to be enacted into 
        law without such bills being printed and presented to Congress 
        in written form prior to final passage, Congress has--
                    (A) imposed upon the people of the United States 
                excessively long bills, largely written by an unelected 
                bureaucracy, resulting in generally incomprehensible, 
                cumbersome, oppressive, and burdensome laws, containing 
                hidden provisions for special interests;
                    (B) deprived the people of the United States and 
                their elected Senators and Members of a full and fair 
                opportunity to examine the text of bills, and all 
                amendments thereto, prior to passage;
                    (C) undermined the confidence of the people of the 
                United States as a result of its failure to provide 
                adequate notice to the people before a vote is taken on 
                the bills and amendments thereto; and
                    (D) has called into question the integrity and 
                reliability of the legislative processes in both Houses 
                of Congress by its failure to ensure that each Senator 
                and each Member of the House of Representatives has, 
                prior to passage, either listened attentively to the 
                reading of the full text of each bill, and amendments 
                thereto, or has personally read the text thereof.
            (13) Federal law currently sets forth various requirements 
        relating to the form of bills and resolutions, and the 
        procedure for enacting laws, including--
                    (A) the form of the enacting clause of all Acts of 
                Congress (section 101 of title 1, United States Code);
                    (B) the form of the resolving clause of all joint 
                resolutions (section 102 of title 1, United States 
                Code);
                    (C) a limitation on the use of enacting or 
                resolving words (section 103 of title 1, United States 
                Code);
                    (D) the requirement regarding the numbering of 
                sections and the requirement that each contain a single 
                proposition (section 104 of title 1, United States 
                Code);
                    (E) the style and title for all bills making 
                appropriations (section 105 of title 1, United States 
                Code); and
                    (F) the process by which each bill or joint 
                resolution is handled after passage (section 106 of 
                title 1, United States Code).
