Requires applications to include a feasibility study, funded under this Act, which contains specified information.\n\nRequires the Secretary to decide whether to enter into such a contract within six months after receiving an application.\n\nRequires independent evaluation of a state or local government social impact pay for performance contract project.\n\nMakes appropriations for 10 years to carry out this Act.\n\nEstablishes the Federal Interagency Council on Social Impact Pay for Performance Contracts.\n\nAuthorizes the Comptroller General (GAO) to audit the activities of any state, local government, or nongovernment that receives funds under this Act.\n\nAmends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to require the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to consider, in assessing and taking into account the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, its investments in social impact pay for performance contract projects."
