        vehicles.

        large amounts, and are non-technical and commercial in nature;
            (5) allows for easy conduct of a spend analysis under

        consolidation, and the need to achieve the statutory small

submit to Congress a report on the implementation of this Act. The 
report shall include, at a minimum--

        services that was strategically sourced during the year covered 
        by the report;
