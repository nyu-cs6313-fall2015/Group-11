Title I: Transfer of Excess United States Naval Vessels - Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2013 - (Sec. 102) Authorizes the President to transfer on a grant basis to Mexico, the OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class guided missile frigates CURTS and MCCLUSKY.

Authorizes the President to transfer on a sale basis the OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class guided missile frigates TAYLOR, GARY, CARR, and ELROD to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office of the United States (which is the Taiwan instrumentality designated pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act).

Authorizes the President to transfer any vessel named in this Act to any country named in this Act such that the total number of vessels transferred to such country does not exceed the total number of vessels authorized for transfer to such country by this Act.

States that:

 the value of such vessels transferred on a grant basis shall not be counted against the aggregate value of excess defense articles transferred to countries in any fiscal year under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961; transfer costs shall be charged to the recipient; and to the maximum extent practicable, the country to which a vessel is transferred shall have necessary vessel repair and refurbishment carried out at U.S. shipyards. Terminates transfer authority three years after enactment of this Act.

Title II: Additional Provisions - (Sec. 201) Amends the Arms Export Control Act to direct the President to notify Congress at least 30 days prior to a shipment of certain defense articles.

(Sec. 202) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act to increase annual funds limits for transfers of excess defense articles.

(Sec. 203) Directs the President to report to Congress annually regarding cooperative arrangements providing for the participation of foreign and U.S. military and civilian defense personnel in post-undergraduate flying training and tactical leadership programs and integrated air and missile defense programs at training locations in Southwest Asia.

(Sec. 204) Declares that:

 a defense-related license or other approval from the Department of State may also authorize the export of items subject to the Export Administration Regulations if such items are to be used in or with defense articles controlled on the United States Munitions List; and separate Department of Commerce approval shall not be required, but such items shall remain under Department of Commerce jurisdiction with respect to any subsequent transactions. (Sec. 205) Directs the President to require that at the time of export or reexport of certain major defense equipment such equipment will not be subsequently modified so as to transform it into a defense article.

Authorizes the President to permit the transformation of any major defense equipment into a defense article if in U.S. national interests, and with congressional notification.

(Sec. 206) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise the definition of "security assistance."

(Sec. 207) Amends the Arms Export Control Act to revise the definitions of "defense article" and "defense service."

(Sec. 208) Makes specified technical amendments to the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.

(Sec. 209) States that certain confidentiality of information requirements of the Export Administration Act of 1979 have been in effect from August 20, 2001, and shall remain in effect for four years after enactment of this Act.</summary>
