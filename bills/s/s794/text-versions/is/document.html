SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Dependable Air Service Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. PREVENTION OF INCREASES IN FLIGHT DELAYS AND CANCELLATIONS.

    (a) Prevention of Increases Required.--The Secretary of 
Transportation shall ensure that flight delays and cancellations do not 
result from furloughs of employees of the Federal Aviation 
Administration implemented as a result of any rescission or reduction 
in funding for fiscal year 2013 provided for under--
            (1) a sequestration order issued by the President pursuant 
        to section 251A(7)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
        Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901a(7)(A));
            (2) section 3002 or 3004 of the Consolidated and Further 
        Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (Public Law 113-6); or
            (3) section 251 or 251A of the Balanced Budget and 
        Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901 and 901a).
    (b) Funding.--In carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary of 
Transportation may--
            (1) use amounts available for the operations of the Federal 
        Aviation Administration for fiscal year 2013 as of the day 
        before the date of the enactment of this Act; or
            (2) notwithstanding division G of the Consolidated and 
        Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 (Public Law 113-6), 
        or a sequestration order issued by the President pursuant to 
        section 251A(7)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
        Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901a(7)(A))--
                    (A) increase the amount available for the 
                operations of the Federal Aviation Administration for 
                fiscal year 2013 by an amount the Secretary determines 
                to be necessary to ensure that flight delays and 
                cancellations do not result from the furloughs 
                described in subsection (a); and
                    (B) reduce amounts made available for other 
                programs of the Department of Transportation for fiscal 
                year 2013 by an amount equal to the amount by which 
                funding for the operations of the Federal Aviation 
                Administration is increased under subparagraph (A).
