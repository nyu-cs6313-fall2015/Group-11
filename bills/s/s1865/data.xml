Migratory Bird Habitat Investment and Enhancement Act - Amends the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamp Act to allow the Department of the Interior every five years to set the cost for Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamps, commonly known as Duck Stamps and required to hunt migratory waterfowl. Limits the cost of the stamp to $25 for the first five years and $30 after that.

Permits Interior to waive stamp requirements for certain individuals if it will have a minimal adverse effect on the funds collected.</summary>
