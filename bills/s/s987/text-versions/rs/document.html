                                 A BILL


 
  To maintain the free flow of information to the public by providing 
  conditions for the federally compelled disclosure of information by 
             certain persons connected with the news media.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Free Flow of Information 
Act of 2013''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM COVERED PERSONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Conditions for Compelled Disclosure.--In any 
proceeding or in connection with any issue arising under Federal law, a 
Federal entity may not compel a covered person to comply with a 
subpoena, court order, or other compulsory legal process seeking to 
compel the disclosure of protected information, unless a Federal court 
in the jurisdiction where the subpoena, court order, or other 
compulsory legal process has been or would be issued determines, after 
providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to such covered 
person--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) that the party seeking to compel disclosure of 
        the protected information has exhausted all reasonable 
        alternative sources (other than a covered person) of the 
        protected information; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) in a criminal investigation or 
                prosecution--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) if the party seeking to compel 
                        disclosure is the Federal Government, based on 
                        public information or information obtained from 
                        a source other than the covered person, there 
                        are reasonable grounds to believe that a crime 
                        has occurred;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) based on public information 
                        or information obtained from a source other 
                        than the covered person, there are reasonable 
                        grounds to believe that the protected 
                        information sought is essential to the 
                        investigation or prosecution or to the defense 
                        against the prosecution;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) the Attorney General 
                        certifies that the decision to request 
                        compelled disclosure was made in a manner 
                        consistent with section 50.10 of title 28, Code 
                        of Federal Regulations, if compelled disclosure 
                        is sought by a member of the Department of 
                        Justice in circumstances governed by section 
                        50.10 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iv) the covered person has not 
                        established by clear and convincing evidence 
                        that disclosure of the protected information 
                        would be contrary to the public interest, 
                        taking into account both the public interest in 
                        gathering and disseminating the information or 
                        news at issue and maintaining the free flow of 
                        information and the public interest in 
                        compelling disclosure (including the extent of 
                        any harm to national security); or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) in a matter other than a criminal 
                investigation or prosecution, based on public 
                information or information obtained from a source other 
                than the covered person--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) the protected information 
                        sought is essential to the resolution of the 
                        matter; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) the party seeking to compel 
                        disclosure of the protected information has 
                        established that the interest in compelling 
                        disclosure clearly outweighs the public 
                        interest in gathering and disseminating the 
                        information or news at issue and maintaining 
                        the free flow of information.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Limitations on Content of Information.--A subpoena, 
court order, or other compulsory legal process seeking to compel the 
disclosure of protected information under subsection (a) shall, to the 
extent possible, be narrowly tailored in purpose, subject matter, and 
period of time covered so as to avoid compelling disclosure of 
peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. EXCEPTION RELATING TO CRIMINAL CONDUCT.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Section 2 shall not apply to any 
information, record, document, or item obtained as the result of the 
eyewitness observations of, or obtained during the course of, alleged 
criminal conduct by the covered person, including any physical evidence 
or visual or audio recording of the conduct.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Exception.--This section shall not apply, and, subject 
to sections 4 and 5, section 2 shall apply, if the alleged criminal 
conduct is the act of communicating the documents or information at 
issue.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 4. EXCEPTION TO PREVENT DEATH, KIDNAPPING, SUBSTANTIAL 
              BODILY INJURY, SEX OFFENSES AGAINST MINORS, OR 
              INCAPACITATION OR DESTRUCTION OF CRITICAL 
              INFRASTRUCTURE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Section 2 shall not apply to any protected information 
that is reasonably necessary to stop, prevent, or mitigate a specific 
case of--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) death;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) kidnapping;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) substantial bodily harm;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) conduct that constitutes a criminal offense 
        that is a specified offense against a minor (as those terms are 
        defined in section 111 of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and 
        Safety Act of 2006 (42 U.S.C. 16911)), or an attempt or 
        conspiracy to commit such a criminal offense; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) incapacitation or destruction of critical 
        infrastructure (as defined in section 1016(e) of the USA 
        PATRIOT Act (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e))).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 5. EXCEPTION TO PREVENT TERRORIST ACTIVITY OR HARM TO THE 
              NATIONAL SECURITY.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Section 2 shall not apply to any 
protected information if--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the party seeking to compel disclosure is the 
        Federal Government; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2)(A) in a criminal investigation or prosecution 
        of the allegedly unlawful disclosure of properly classified 
        information, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence 
        that the protected information for which compelled disclosure 
        is sought would materially assist the Federal Government in 
        preventing or mitigating--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) an act of terrorism; 
                        or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) other acts that are 
                        reasonably likely to cause significant and 
                        articulable harm to national security; 
                        or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) in any other criminal investigation or 
        prosecution, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence 
        that the protected information for which compelled disclosure 
        is sought would materially assist the Federal Government in 
        preventing, mitigating, or identifying the perpetrator of--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) an act of terrorism; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) other acts that have caused or are 
                reasonably likely to cause significant and articulable 
                harm to national security.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Deference.--In assessing the existence or extent of 
the harm described in subsection (a), a Federal court shall give 
appropriate deference to a specific factual showing submitted to the 
court by the head of any executive branch agency or department 
concerned.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Relationship to Section 2.--Subsection (a) shall not 
apply, and, subject to sections 3 and 4, section 2 shall apply, to any 
criminal investigation or prosecution of the allegedly unlawful 
disclosure of properly classified information other than one in which 
the protected information is sought by the Federal Government to 
prevent or mitigate the harm specified in subsection (a)(2)(A). In 
considering the extent of any harm to national security when applying 
section 2 to such cases, a Federal court shall give appropriate 
deference to any specific factual showing submitted to the court by the 
head of any executive branch agency or department concerned.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Subsequent Unlawful Disclosure.--The potential for a 
subsequent unlawful disclosure of information by the source sought to 
be identified shall not, by itself and without any showing of 
additional facts beyond such potential disclosure, be sufficient to 
establish that compelled disclosure of the protected information would 
materially assist the Federal Government in preventing or mitigating--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) an act of terrorism; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) other acts that are reasonably likely to cause 
        significant and articulable harm to national 
        security.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 6. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE 
              PROVIDERS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Conditions for Compelled Disclosure.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph 
        (2), if any document or other information from the account of a 
        person who is known to be, or reasonably likely to be, a 
        covered person is sought from a communications service 
        provider, sections 2 through 5 shall apply in the same manner 
        that such sections apply to any document or other information 
        sought from a covered person.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Exception.--If any document or other 
        information from the account of a person who is known to be, or 
        reasonably likely to be, a covered person is sought from a 
        communications service provider under section 2709 of title 18, 
        United States Code, the provisions of sections 2 through 5 
        governing criminal investigations and prosecutions shall apply 
        in the same manner that such sections apply to any document or 
        other information sought from a covered person in the course of 
        a criminal investigation or prosecution, except that clauses 
        (i) and (iii) of section 2(a)(2)(A) and the phrase 
        ``particularly with reference to directly establishing guilt or 
        innocence'' in section 2(a)(2)(A)(ii) shall not 
        apply.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Notice and Opportunity Provided to Covered Persons.--A 
Federal court may compel the disclosure of a document or other 
information described in this section only after the covered person 
from whose account the document or other information is sought has been 
given--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) notice from the party seeking the document or 
        other information through a subpoena or other compulsory 
        request, not later than the time at which such subpoena or 
        request is issued to the communications service provider; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) an opportunity to be heard before the court 
        before compelling testimony or the disclosure of a 
        document.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Exception to Notice Requirement.--Notice under 
subsection (b)(1) may be delayed for not more than 45 days if the 
Federal court involved determines by clear and convincing evidence that 
such notice would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of a 
criminal investigation, a national security investigation, or 
intelligence gathering, or that exigent circumstances exist. This 
period may be extended by the court for an additional period of not 
more than 45 days each time the court makes such a 
determination.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Notice to Communications Service Provider.--In all 
cases in which notice is required to be provided to the covered person 
under this section, a copy of such notice shall be provided 
simultaneously to the communications service provider from whom 
disclosure is sought. Once it has received such notice, the 
communications service provider shall not comply with the request for 
disclosure unless and until disclosure is either ordered by the court 
or authorized in writing by the covered person.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 7. SOURCES AND WORK PRODUCT PRODUCED WITHOUT PROMISE OR 
              AGREEMENT OF CONFIDENTIALITY.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Nothing in this Act shall supersede, dilute, or preclude 
any law or court decision compelling or not compelling disclosure by a 
covered person or communications service provider of--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) information identifying a source who provided 
        information without a promise or agreement of confidentiality 
        made by the covered person as part of engaging in journalism; 
        or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) records, other information, or contents of a 
        communication obtained without a promise or agreement that such 
        records, other information, or contents of a communication 
        would be confidential.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 8. PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW AND APPEAL.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Conditions for Ex Parte Review or Submissions Under 
Seal.--With regard to any determination made by a Federal court under 
this Act, upon a showing of good cause, that Federal court may receive 
and consider submissions from the parties in camera or under seal, and 
if the court determines it is necessary, ex parte.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Contempt of Court.--With regard to any determination 
made by a Federal court under this Act, a Federal court may find a 
covered person to be in civil or criminal contempt if the covered 
person fails to comply with an order of a Federal court compelling 
disclosure of protected information.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) To Provide for Timely Determination.--With regard to 
any determination to be made by a Federal court under this Act, that 
Federal court, to the extent practicable, shall make that determination 
not later than 30 days after the date of receiving a motion requesting 
the court make that determination.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Expedited Appeal Process.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The courts of appeal shall have 
        jurisdiction--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) of appeals by a Federal entity or 
                covered person of an interlocutory order of a Federal 
                court under this Act; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) in an appeal of a final decision of a 
                Federal court by a Federal entity or covered person, to 
                review any determination of a Federal court under this 
                Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Expedition of appeals.--It shall be the duty 
        of a Federal court to which an appeal is made under this 
        subsection to advance on the docket and to expedite to the 
        greatest possible extent the disposition of that 
        appeal.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 9. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Nothing in this Act may be construed to--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) preempt any law or claim relating to 
        defamation, slander, or libel;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) modify the requirements of section 552a of 
        title 5, United States Code, or Federal laws or rules relating 
        to grand jury secrecy (except that this Act shall apply in any 
        proceeding and in connection with any issue arising under that 
        section or the Federal laws or rules relating to grand jury 
        secrecy);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) create new obligations, or affect or modify 
        the authorities or obligations of a Federal entity with respect 
        to the acquisition or dissemination of information pursuant to 
        the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 
        1801 et seq.); or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) preclude voluntary disclosure of information 
        to a Federal entity in a situation that is not governed by this 
        Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 10. AUDIT.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The Inspector General of the Department 
of Justice shall perform a comprehensive audit of the use of this Act 
during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act and 
ending on December 31, 2016. The audit shall include an examination of 
each instance in which a court failed to compel the disclosure of 
protected information under this Act, and whether this Act has created 
any procedural impediments that have had a detrimental operational 
impact on the activities of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Report.--Not later than June 30, 2017, the Inspector 
General of the Department of Justice shall submit to the Committee on 
the Judiciary and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate 
and the Committee on the Judiciary and the Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence of the House of Representatives a report containing the 
results of the audit conducted under subsection (a).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Review.--Not later than 30 days before the submission 
of the report under subsection (b), the Inspector General of the 
Department of Justice shall provide the report to the Attorney General 
and the Director of National Intelligence. The Attorney General or the 
Director of National Intelligence may provide such comments to be 
included in the report submitted under subsection (b) as the Attorney 
General or the Director of National Intelligence may consider 
necessary.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Form.--The report submitted under subsection (b) and 
any comments included under subsection (c) shall be in unclassified 
form, but may include a classified annex.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SEC. 2. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM COVERED JOURNALISTS.

    (a) Conditions for Compelled Disclosure.--In any proceeding or in 
connection with any issue arising under Federal law, a Federal entity 
may not compel a covered journalist to comply with a subpoena, court 
order, or other compulsory legal process seeking to compel the 
disclosure of protected information, unless a judge of the United 
States in the jurisdiction where the subpoena, court order, or other 
compulsory legal process has been or would be issued determines, after 
providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to such covered 
journalist--
            (1) that the party seeking to compel disclosure of the 
        protected information has exhausted all reasonable alternative 
        sources (other than a covered journalist) of the protected 
        information; and
            (2) that--
                    (A) in a criminal investigation or prosecution--
                            (i) if the party seeking to compel 
                        disclosure is the Federal Government, based on 
                        public information or information obtained from 
                        a source other than the covered journalist, 
                        there are reasonable grounds to believe that a 
                        crime has occurred;
                            (ii) based on public information or 
                        information obtained from a source other than 
                        the covered journalist, there are reasonable 
                        grounds to believe that the protected 
                        information sought is essential to the 
                        investigation or prosecution or to the defense 
                        against the prosecution;
                            (iii) the Attorney General certifies that 
                        the decision to request compelled disclosure 
                        was made in a manner consistent with section 
                        50.10 of title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, 
                        if compelled disclosure is sought by a member 
                        of the Department of Justice in circumstances 
                        governed by section 50.10 of title 28, Code of 
                        Federal Regulations; and
                            (iv) the covered journalist has not 
                        established by clear and convincing evidence 
                        that disclosure of the protected information 
                        would be contrary to the public interest, 
                        taking into account both the public interest in 
                        gathering and disseminating the information or 
                        news at issue and maintaining the free flow of 
                        information and the public interest in 
                        compelling disclosure (including the extent of 
                        any harm to national security); or
                    (B) in a matter other than a criminal investigation 
                or prosecution, based on public information or 
                information obtained from a source other than the 
                covered journalist--
                            (i) the protected information sought is 
                        essential to the resolution of the matter; and
                            (ii) the party seeking to compel disclosure 
                        of the protected information has established 
                        that the interest in compelling disclosure 
                        clearly outweighs the public interest in 
                        gathering and disseminating the information or 
                        news at issue and maintaining the free flow of 
                        information.
    (b) Limitations on Content of Information.--A subpoena, court 
order, or other compulsory legal process seeking to compel the 
disclosure of protected information under subsection (a) shall, to the 
extent possible, be narrowly tailored in purpose, subject matter, and 
period of time covered so as to avoid compelling disclosure of 
peripheral, nonessential, or speculative information.
    (c) Rule of Construction for Compelled Disclosure From Covered 
Journalists.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude, 
in addition to the procedures required under this section--
            (1) the requirement that a Federal or governmental entity 
        shall obtain a warrant for certain communications, as set forth 
        in section 2703 of title 18, United States Code (commonly known 
        as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act); or
            (2) the requirements and procedures regarding search and 
        seizure set forth in Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
        Procedure.

SEC. 3. EXCEPTION RELATING TO CRIMINAL CONDUCT.

    (a) In General.--Section 2 shall not apply to any information, 
record, document, or item obtained as the result of the eyewitness 
observations of, or obtained during the course of, alleged criminal 
conduct by the covered journalist, including any physical evidence or 
visual or audio recording of the conduct.
    (b) Exception.--This section shall not apply, and, subject to 
sections 4 and 5, section 2 shall apply, if the alleged criminal 
conduct is the act of communicating the documents or information at 
issue.

SEC. 4. EXCEPTION TO PREVENT DEATH, KIDNAPPING, SUBSTANTIAL BODILY 
              INJURY, SEX OFFENSES AGAINST MINORS, OR INCAPACITATION OR 
              DESTRUCTION OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

    Section 2 shall not apply to any protected information that is 
reasonably necessary to stop, prevent, or mitigate a specific case of--
            (1) death;
            (2) kidnapping;
            (3) substantial bodily harm;
            (4) conduct that constitutes a criminal offense that is a 
        specified offense against a minor (as those terms are defined 
        in section 111 of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety 
        Act of 2006 (42 U.S.C. 16911)), or an attempt or conspiracy to 
        commit such a criminal offense; or
            (5) incapacitation or destruction of critical 
        infrastructure (as defined in section 1016(e) of the USA 
        PATRIOT Act (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e))).

SEC. 5. EXCEPTION TO PREVENT TERRORIST ACTIVITY OR HARM TO THE NATIONAL 
              SECURITY.

    (a) In General.--Section 2 shall not apply to any protected 
information if--
            (1) the party seeking to compel disclosure is the Federal 
        Government; and
            (2)(A) in a criminal investigation or prosecution of the 
        allegedly unlawful disclosure of properly classified 
        information, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence 
        that the protected information for which compelled disclosure 
        is sought would materially assist the Federal Government in 
        preventing or mitigating--
                    (i) an act of terrorism; or
                    (ii) other acts that are reasonably likely to cause 
                significant and articulable harm to national security; 
                or
            (B) in any other criminal investigation or prosecution, the 
        court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
        protected information for which compelled disclosure is sought 
        would materially assist the Federal Government in preventing, 
        mitigating, or identifying the perpetrator of--
                    (i) an act of terrorism; or
                    (ii) other acts that have caused or are reasonably 
                likely to cause significant and articulable harm to 
                national security.
    (b) Deference.--In assessing the existence or extent of the harm 
described in subsection (a), a Federal court shall give appropriate 
deference to a specific factual showing submitted to the court by the 
head of any executive branch agency or department concerned.
    (c) Relationship to Section 2.--Subsection (a) shall not apply, 
and, subject to sections 3 and 4, section 2 shall apply, to any 
criminal investigation or prosecution of the allegedly unlawful 
disclosure of properly classified information other than one in which 
the protected information is sought by the Federal Government to 
prevent or mitigate the harm specified in subsection (a)(2)(A). In 
considering the extent of any harm to national security when applying 
section 2 to such cases, a Federal court shall give appropriate 
deference to any specific factual showing submitted to the court by the 
head of any executive branch agency or department concerned.
    (d) Subsequent Unlawful Disclosure.--The potential for a subsequent 
unlawful disclosure of information by the source sought to be 
identified shall not, by itself and without any showing of additional 
facts beyond such potential disclosure, be sufficient to establish that 
compelled disclosure of the protected information would materially 
assist the Federal Government in preventing or mitigating--
            (1) an act of terrorism; or
            (2) other acts that are reasonably likely to cause 
        significant and articulable harm to national security.

SEC. 6. COMPELLED DISCLOSURE FROM COVERED SERVICE PROVIDERS.

    (a) Conditions for Compelled Disclosure.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), if 
        any document or other information from the account of a person 
        who is known to be, or reasonably likely to be, a covered 
        journalist is sought from a covered service provider, sections 
        2 through 5 shall apply in the same manner that such sections 
        apply to any document or other information sought from a 
        covered journalist.
            (2) Exception.--If any document or other information from 
        the account of a person who is known to be, or reasonably 
        likely to be, a covered journalist is sought from a covered 
        service provider under section 2709 of title 18, United States 
        Code, the provisions of sections 2 through 5 governing criminal 
        investigations and prosecutions shall apply in the same manner 
        that such sections apply to any document or other information 
        sought from a covered journalist in the course of a criminal 
        investigation or prosecution, except that clauses (i) and (iii) 
        of section 2(a)(2)(A) shall not apply.
    (b) Notice and Opportunity Provided to Covered Journalists.--A 
judge of the United States may compel the disclosure of a document or 
other information described in this section only after the covered 
journalist from whose account the document or other information is 
sought has been given--
            (1) notice from the party seeking the document or other 
        information through a subpoena or other compulsory request, not 
        later than the time at which such subpoena or request is issued 
        to the covered service provider; and
            (2) an opportunity to be heard before the judge of the 
        United States before compelling testimony or the disclosure of 
        a document.
    (c) Exception to Notice Requirement.--
            (1) In general.--Notice and opportunity to be heard under 
        subsection (b) may be delayed for not more than 45 days if the 
        judge of the United States involved determines by clear and 
        convincing evidence that such notice would pose a clear and 
        substantial threat to the integrity of a criminal 
        investigation, would risk grave harm to national security, or 
        would present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.
            (2) Extension.--The 45-day period described in paragraph 
        (1) may be extended by the court for 1 additional period of not 
        more than 45 days if the judge of the United States involved 
        makes a new and independent determination by clear and 
        convincing evidence that providing notice to the covered 
        journalist would pose a clear and substantial threat to the 
        integrity of a criminal investigation, would risk grave harm to 
        national security, or would present an imminent risk of death 
        or serious bodily harm under current circumstances.
            (3) Substantial threat to the integrity of a criminal 
        investigation.--For purposes of this subsection, a substantial 
        threat to the integrity of a criminal investigation exists when 
        the judge of the United States involved finds, by clear and 
        convincing evidence, that the target of the investigation may 
        learn of the investigation and destroy evidence if notice is 
        provided.
            (4) Protective orders.--For purposes of a determination 
        under this subsection, the judge of the United States involved 
        shall consider whether providing notice pursuant to a 
        protective order to the covered journalist may mitigate any 
        clear and substantial threat to the integrity of a criminal 
        investigation, any risk of grave harm to national security, or 
        any imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.
    (d) Notice to Covered Service Provider.--In all cases in which 
notice is required to be provided to the covered journalist under this 
section, a copy of such notice shall be provided simultaneously to the 
covered service provider from whom disclosure is sought. Once it has 
received such notice, the covered service provider shall not comply 
with the request for disclosure unless and until disclosure is either 
ordered by the court or authorized in writing by the covered 
journalist.
    (e) Rule of Construction for Delayed Notice.--The delayed notice 
requirements in this section shall be construed to supersede the 
requirements for delayed notice set forth in sections 2703 and 2705(a) 
of title 18, United States Code.
