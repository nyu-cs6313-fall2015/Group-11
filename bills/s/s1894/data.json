Requires subsequent studies and reports every 60 days until the Comptroller General makes such a determination.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), if a determination is made on the basis of the last such report submitted during a fiscal year that the number of uninsured has decreased as compared to the number on the date of PPACA enactment, to reduce the unobligated funding for the following, according to a specified ratio: health insurance consumer information, assistance to states for health care exchanges, and the Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund. Deems such amounts to rescinded and permanently cancelled for purposes of debt reduction."
