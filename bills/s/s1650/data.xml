  <summary>11/5/2013--Introduced.
Amends the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to provide that nothing in such Act prohibits possessing, selling, bartering, purchasing, shipping, and transporting any authentic Alaska Native handicraft on the basis that it contains a nonedible migratory bird part. Makes such exemption inapplicable with respect to any handicraft containing any part of a migratory bird that was taken in a wasteful manner.</summary>
