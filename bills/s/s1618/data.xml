Enhanced Security Clearance Act of 2013 - Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM): (1) to implement the enhanced security clearance system (i.e., the database established by OPM under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004) within one year after enactment of this Act; and (2) not less than twice every five years, to review, using such system, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of information relating to the security clearance or access to classified information of each individual who is appointed to a position that requires such a clearance or access (covered individual). Requires such security clearance system to: (1) integrate information from various sources, including government and commercial data sources, the major consumer reporting agencies, and social media; and (2) include relevant information on individuals who are being considered for, or have been appointed to, a position that requires access to classified information.

 Exempts from the reporting requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act any communication made in connection with the granting, denial, review, or revocation of a federal security clearance or access to classification of a covered individual.</summary>
