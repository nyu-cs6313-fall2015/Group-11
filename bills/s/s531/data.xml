Promoting Physical Activity for Americans Act - Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to publish a report at least every 10 years that contains physical activity recommendations for the general public, based on the most current scientific and medical knowledge and including additional information for population subgroups, as needed.

Requires the Secretary to publish, no more than 5 years after the first full report is published and every 10 years thereafter, an updated report detailing evidence-based practices and highlighting continuing issues with respect to physical activity. Permits a report to focus on particular subgroups or issues relating to physical activity.

Requires any federal agency that proposes to issue physical activity recommendations that differ from the recommendations in the most recent full report to submit the proposed recommendations to the Secretary for review to ensure they are either consistent with the report or based on the most current scientific and medical knowledge.</summary>
