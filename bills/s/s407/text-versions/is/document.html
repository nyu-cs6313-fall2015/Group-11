                                 A BILL


 
   To provide funding for construction and major rehabilitation for 
  projects located on inland and intracoastal waterways of the United 
                    States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reinvesting In Vital Economic Rivers 
and Waterways Act of 2013'' or the ``RIVER Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that the inland waterways navigation system--
            (1) is an essential economic resource for the United 
        States;
            (2) serves as the most efficient sustainable transportation 
        mode for bulk commodities in the United States while 
        maintaining environmental resources; and
            (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act, is underfunded 
        and needs significant changes to remain viable in the future.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purpose of this Act is to establish a sustainable, cost-
effective way to ensure that the inland and intracoastal waterways of 
the United States remain economically viable through--
            (1) the redesign of the program and project management 
        process applicable to the construction and major rehabilitation 
        of navigation projects on those waterways;
            (2) the continued development and improvement of inland 
        waterways navigation systems;
            (3) enhanced efficiency of inland waterways navigation 
        project completion schedules; and
            (4) inland waterways navigation capital investments to 
        ensure that projects can be completed in a reasonable timeframe 
        and to allow maximum systemwide benefits.
