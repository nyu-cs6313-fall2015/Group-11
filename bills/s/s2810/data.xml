  <summary>9/15/2014--Introduced.
Service Members Transition Improvement Act of 2014 - Requires the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to develop procedures to share with state veterans agencies information, in electronic data format, on members of the Armed Forces who are separating from service in order to facilitate the transition of such members to civilian life. Identifies that information as military service and separation data and specified contact information.

Requires the member's consent before that information may be shared.

Directs the Secretary to ensure that the state veterans agencies only share such information with county veterans service offices for such purposes as the Secretary specifies for the administration and delivery of benefits.</summary>
