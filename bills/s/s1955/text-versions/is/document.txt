            (2) does not include transport of a knife with the intent 
        to commit an offense punishable by imprisonment for a term 
        exceeding 1 year involving the use or threatened use of force 
        against another person, or with knowledge, or reasonable cause 
        to believe, that such an offense is to be committed in the 
        course of, or arising from, the journey.
    (b) Transport of Knives.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, rule, or regulation of the United States, or of a State or 
        political subdivision of a State, an individual who is not 
        otherwise prohibited by Federal law from possessing, 
        transporting, shipping, or receiving a knife may transport a 
        knife from any State or place where the individual may lawfully 
        possess, carry, or transport the knife to any other State or 
        place where the individual may lawfully possess, carry, or 
        transport the knife if--
                    (A) in the case of transport by motor vehicle, the 
                knife is not directly accessible from the passenger 
                compartment of the motor vehicle, or, in the case of a 
                motor vehicle without a compartment separate from the 
                passenger compartment, the knife is contained in a 
                locked container, glove compartment, or console; or
                    (B) in the case of transport by means other than a 
                motor vehicle, including any transport over land, on or 
                through water, or through the air, the knife is

                    (A) may carry in the passenger compartment of a 
                motor vehicle a knife or tool designed for enabling 
                escape in an emergency that incorporates a blunt tipped 
                safety blade or a guarded blade or both for cutting 
                safety belts; and
                    (B) shall not be required to secure a knife or tool 
                described in subparagraph (A) in a locked container, 
                glove compartment, or console.
            (2) Limitation.--This subsection shall not apply to the

        procedures of the Transportation Security Administration.
    (d) No Arrest or Detention.--An individual who is transporting a 
knife in compliance with this section may not be arrested or otherwise 
detained for violation of any law, rule, or regulation of a State or 
political subdivision of a State related to the possession, transport, 
or carrying of a knife, unless there is probable cause to believe that 
the individual is not in compliance with subsection (b).
    (e) Claim or Defense.--An individual may assert this section as a 
claim or defense in any civil or criminal action or proceeding. When an

compliance with subsection (b).
    (f) Right of Action.--
            (1) In general.--Any individual who, under color of any 
        statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State 
        or political subdivision of a State, subjects, or causes to be 
        subjected, any individual to the deprivation of the rights, 
        privileges, or immunities provided for in this section, shall 
        be liable to the individual so deprived in an action at law or
