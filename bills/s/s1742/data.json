    "text": "Entrance Fee Suspension Act of 2013 - Directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, during the period April 10-25, 2014, to suspend the collection of fees for admission to units of the National Park System and units of the National Wildlife Refuge System, respectively.\n\nRequires the Secretary to report to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the total amount of fees that would have been collected for admission to such units if collection had not been suspended.\n\nDirects the Secretary, during FY2014, to transfer amounts equivalent to such uncollected fees from discretionary unobligated balances that are not designated as emergency or overseas contingency operations. Entitles the Secretary to receive and use such amounts to carry out this Act without further appropriation.\n\nAmends the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as an offset to such funds transfers, to extend from October 29, 2021, to November 5, 2021, the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to charge and collect specified customs fees."
