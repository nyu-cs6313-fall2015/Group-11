                insufficient quantity of qualifying applications for 
                certification pending at the time of the review, the 
                Secretary is authorized to conduct an additional 
                program for applications for certification.
            ``(5) Disclosure of allocations.--The Secretary shall, upon 
        making a certification under this subsection, publicly disclose
