SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) over the past 2 decades, wildfires have increased 
        dramatically in size and costs;
            (2) existing budget mechanisms for estimating the costs of 
        wildfire suppression are not keeping pace with the actual costs 
        for wildfire suppression due in part to improper budget 
        estimation methodology;
            (3) the FLAME Funds have not been adequate in supplementing 
        wildland fire management funds in cases in which wildland fire 
        management accounts are exhausted; and
            (4) the practice of transferring funds from other agency 
        funds (including the hazardous fuels treatment accounts) by the 
        Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior to 
        pay for wildfire suppression activities, commonly known as 
        ``fire-borrowing'', does not support the missions of the Forest 
        Service and the Department of the Interior with respect to 
        protecting human life and property from the threat of 
        wildfires.

SEC. 102. FLAME ACT AMENDMENTS.

                        complexity, severity, or threat posed by the
