SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Recent studies indicate that thousands of children and 
        youth are at risk for human trafficking in the United States.
            (2) A significant percentage of children and youth who are 
        trafficked in the United States will commit prostitution 
        offenses or other nonviolent offenses in connection with their 
        exploitation by a trafficker.
            (3) The prostitution statutes in many jurisdictions do not 
        differentiate between adult prostitutes and children or youths 
        who have been commercially sexually exploited.
            (4) Evidence suggests that runaway or homeless children and 
        youth and young adults leaving the foster care system are 
        especially vulnerable to commercial sexual exploitation.
            (5) The majority of children and youths who are involved in 
        the criminal or justice systems are responsive to interventions 
        that integrate treatment, rehabilitation, and support services.
            (6) Collaborative programs between services providers and 
        criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure the provision 
        of counseling, housing and related services for trafficking 
        victims can reduce the number of such individuals in 
        corrections facilities.

SEC. 4. PURPOSE.

    (a) In General.--The purpose of this Act is to combat domestic 
human trafficking by facilitating collaboration among the criminal 
justice system, juvenile justice system, and support services.
    (b) Collaboration.--The collaboration described in subsection (a) 
is needed--
            (1) to protect public safety by intervening with juvenile 
        offenders who have been trafficked;
            (2) to provide courts, including new trafficking victims' 
        courts, with appropriate treatment options;
            (3) to maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution in 
        appropriate cases involving youths who have committed 
        nonviolent offenses, such as prostitution, in connection with 
        their exploitation by a trafficker;
            (4) to promote adequate training for criminal justice 
        system personnel about the unique challenges facing juveniles 
        who have been trafficked and the appropriate response to such 
        children and youths in the criminal justice system;
            (5) to promote communication among adult or juvenile 
        justice personnel, medical personnel, mental health treatment 
        personnel, and support services such as housing, job placement, 
        community, faith based, and crime victims organizations; and
            (6) to promote communication and collaboration among 
        governmental officials with respect to all forms of human 
        trafficking in the United States.
