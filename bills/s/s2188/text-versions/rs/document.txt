                    (A) by striking ``The term'' and inserting 
                ``Effective beginning on June 18, 1934, the term''; and
                    (B) by striking ``any recognized Indian tribe now 
                under Federal jurisdiction'' and inserting ``any 
                federally recognized Indian tribe''.
            (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1)

        U.S.C. 479), on the date of enactment of that Act.
    (b) Ratification and Confirmation of Actions.--Any action taken by 
the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934 
(commonly known as the ``Indian Reorganization Act'') (25 U.S.C. 461 et 
seq.), for any Indian tribe that was federally recognized on the date 
of that action is ratified and confirmed, to the extent such action is 
subjected to challenge based on whether the Indian tribe was federally 
recognized or under Federal jurisdiction on June 18, 1934, as if the 
action had, by prior Act of Congress, been specifically authorized and 
directed.
    (c) Effect on Other Laws.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in this section or the amendments

                seq.), as amended by subsection (a); or
                    (B) any limitation on the authority of the 
                Secretary of the Interior under any Federal law or 
                regulation other than the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 
                U.S.C. 461 et seq.), as so amended.

        other Federal law shall be considered to be a reference to that 
        Act as amended by subsection (a).
    (d) Study; Publication.--
            (1) Study.--The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct, 
        and submit to Congress a report describing the results of, a 
        study that--
                    (A) assesses the effects of the decision of the 
                Supreme Court in the case styled Carcieri v. Salazar 
                (129 S. Ct. 1058) on Indian tribes and tribal land; and
                    (B) includes a list of each Indian tribe and parcel
