SECTION 1. PROHIBITIONS RELATING TO REFERENCES TO GI BILL AND POST-9/11 
              GI BILL.

    (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 36 of title 38, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 3697B. Prohibition relating to references to GI Bill and Post-9/
              11 GI Bill
    ``(a) Prohibition.--(1) No person may, except with the written 
permission of the Secretary, use the words and phrases covered by this 
subsection in connection with any promotion, goods, services, or 
commercial activity in a manner that reasonably and falsely suggests 
that such use is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the Department or 
any component thereof.
    ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the words and phrases 
covered by this subsection are as follows:
            ``(A) `GI Bill'.
            ``(B) `Post-9/11 GI Bill'.
    ``(3) A determination that a use of one or more words and phrases 
covered by this subsection in connection with a promotion, goods, 
services, or commercial activity is not a violation of this subsection 
may not be made solely on the ground that such promotion, goods, 
services, or commercial activity includes a disclaimer of affiliation 
with the Department or any component thereof.
    ``(b) Enforcement by Attorney General.--(1) When any person is 
engaged or is about to engage in an act or practice which constitutes 
or will constitute conduct prohibited by subsection (a), the Attorney 
General may initiate a civil proceeding in a district court of the 
United States to enjoin such act or practice.
    ``(2) Such court may, at any time before final determination, enter 
such restraining orders or prohibitions, or take such other action as 
is warranted, to prevent injury to the United States or to any person 
or class of persons for whose protection the action is brought.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
chapter 36 of such title is amended by inserting after the item 
relating to section 3697A the following new item:

``3697B. Prohibition relating to references to GI Bill and Post-9/11 GI 
                            Bill.''.
