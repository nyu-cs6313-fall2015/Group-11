                performed by State and local law enforcement personnel 
                for purposes of enabling such law enforcement personnel 
                to be dispatched to keep schools and students safe from

                    ``(B) helping conduct school security assessments 
                and safety plans; and
                    ``(C) conducting capital improvements related to

            ``(2) Use of funds.--Such funds shall be used for the 
        following:
                    ``(A) The pay, allowances, clothing, subsistence, 
                gratuities, travel, and related expenses, as authorized 
                by State law, of personnel of the National Guard of 
                that State used, while not in Federal service, for the 
                purpose of supplementing State and local efforts to 
                keep schools safe from violence.
                    ``(B) The operation and maintenance of the 
                equipment and facilities of the National Guard of that

                and local efforts to keep schools safe from violence. 
                However, the use of such funds for the procurement of 
                equipment may not exceed $5,000 per item, unless 
                approval for procurement of equipment in excess of that 
                amount is granted in advance by the Secretary of 
                Defense.
    ``(b) Use of Personnel Performing Full-Time National Guard Duty.--
(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, personnel 
of the National Guard of a State may, in accordance with the plan 
referred to in subsection (c) with respect to the State concerned, be 
ordered to perform full-time National Guard duty under section 502(f) 
of this title for the purpose of supplementing State and local efforts 
to keep schools safe from violence.
    ``(2)(A) A member of the National Guard serving on full-time 
National Guard duty under orders authorized under paragraph (1) shall 
participate in the training required under section 502(a) of this title 
in addition to the duty performed for the purpose authorized under that 
paragraph. The pay, allowances, and other benefits of the member while 
participating in the training shall be the same as those to which the 
member is entitled while performing duty for the purpose of 
supplementing State and local efforts to keep schools safe from 
violence. The member is not entitled to additional pay, allowances, or 
other benefits for participation in training required under section 
502(a)(1) of this title.
    ``(B) To ensure that the use of units and personnel of the National 
Guard of a State pursuant to a plan referred to in subsection (c) does 
not degrade the training and readiness of such units and personnel, the 
following requirements shall apply in determining the activities 
supplementing State and local efforts to keep schools safe from 
violence that units and personnel of the National Guard of a State may 
perform:
            ``(i) The performance of the activities may not adversely 
        affect the quality of that training or otherwise interfere with

        perform the military functions of the member or unit.
            ``(ii) National Guard personnel will not degrade their

        performed by a unit organized to serve as a unit, the 
        activities will support valid unit training requirements.
