    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Diabetic Testing Supply Access Act 
of 2014''.

SEC. 2. AUTHORITY FOR RETAIL COMMUNITY PHARMACIES TO DELIVER DIABETIC 
              TESTING SUPPLIES TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.

    (a) In General.--Section 1847(a) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395w-3(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph:
            ``(8) Nothing in this section shall be construed as 
        authorizing the Secretary (through regulation, guidance, 
        instruction, or otherwise) to restrict or eliminate an 
        individual's option of electing, regardless of delivery method 
        (except by mail and private parcel service), to have diabetic 
        testing supplies delivered to the individual by a retail 
        community pharmacy (as defined in section 1927(k)(10)), 
        including a retail community pharmacy that contracts with a 
        long-term care facility, assisted living facility, group home, 
        or other type of residential setting recognized by the State. 
        This paragraph shall not be construed as changing the amount of 
        payment made under this part for diabetic testing supplies, but 
        only as authorizing delivery of such supplies to individuals 
        through retail community pharmacies.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to diabetic testing supplies delivered on or after the date of 
the enactment of this Act.
                                 <all>
