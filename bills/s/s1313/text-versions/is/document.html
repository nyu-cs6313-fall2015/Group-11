                organization in self-defense against an action 
                described in subparagraph (B); and

SEC. 702. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President and the Secretary should lead a high-
        level diplomatic effort to encourage other responsible nations 
        to withhold contributions to UNRWA, to any successor or related 
        entity, or to the regular budget of the United Nations for the 
        support of UNRWA or a successor entity (through staff positions 
        provided by the United Nations Secretariat, or otherwise) until 
        UNRWA has met the conditions listed in subparagraphs (A) 
        through (F) of section 301(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act 
        of 1961 (as added by section 701);
            (2) citizens of recognized states should be removed from 
        UNRWA's jurisdiction;
            (3) UNRWA's definition of a ``Palestine refugee'' should be 
        changed to that used for a refugee by the Office of the United 
        Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; and
            (4) it should be the goal of the United States to eliminate 
        UNRWA and give the Office of the United Nations High 
        Commissioner for Refugees full responsibility for Palestinian 
        refugees as defined under paragraph (3).

                        obligations or the purposes and principles of 
                        the Charter of the United Nations.
            (3) Detail of expenditures.--The President shall direct the 
        United States Permanent Representative to the IAEA to use the 
        voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the IAEA to 
        secure, as part of the regular budget presentation of the IAEA 
        to Member States of the IAEA, a detailed breakdown by country 
        of expenditures of the IAEA for safeguards inspections and 
        nuclear security activities.
    (c) Membership.--
            (1) In general.--The President shall direct the United 
        States Permanent Representative to the IAEA to use the voice, 
        vote, and influence of the United States at the IAEA to block 
        the membership on the Board of Governors of the IAEA of a 
        Member State of the IAEA that has not signed and ratified the 
        Additional Protocol and--
                    (A) is under investigation for a breach of or 
                noncompliance with its IAEA obligations or the purposes 
                and principles of the Charter of the United Nations; or
                    (B) that is in violation of its IAEA obligations or 
                the purposes and principles of the Charter of the 
                United Nations.
            (2) Criteria.--The United States Permanent Representative 
        to the IAEA shall make every effort to modify the criteria for 
        Board membership to reflect the principles described in 
        paragraph (1).
    (d) Small Quantities Protocol.--The President shall direct the 
United States Permanent Representative to the IAEA to use the voice, 
vote, and influence of the United States at the IAEA to make every 
effort to ensure that the IAEA changes the policy regarding the Small 
Quantities Protocol in order to--
            (1) rescind and eliminate the Small Quantities Protocol;
            (2) require that any IAEA Member State that has previously 
        signed a Small Quantities Protocol to sign, ratify, and 
        implement the Additional Protocol, provide immediate access for 
        IAEA inspectors to its nuclear-related facilities, and agree to 
        the strongest inspections regime of its nuclear efforts; and
            (3) require that any IAEA Member State that does not comply 
        with paragraph (2) to be ineligible to receive nuclear 
        material, technology, equipment, or assistance from any IAEA 
        Member State and subject to the penalties described in 
        subsection (a)(3).
    (e) Nuclear Program of Iran.--
            (1) United states action.--The President shall direct the 
        United States Permanent Representative to the IAEA to use the 
        voice, vote, and influence of the United States at the IAEA to 
        make every effort to ensure the adoption of a resolution by the 
        IAEA Board of Governors that, in addition to the restrictions 
        already imposed, makes Iran ineligible to receive any nuclear 
        material, technology, equipment, or assistance from any IAEA 
        Member State and ineligible for any IAEA assistance not related 
        to safeguards inspections or nuclear security until the IAEA 
        Board of Governors determines that Iran--
                    (A) is providing full access to IAEA inspectors to 
                its nuclear-related facilities;
                    (B) has fully implemented and is in compliance with 
                the Additional Protocol; and
                    (C) has permanently ceased and dismantled all 
                activities and programs related to nuclear-enrichment 
                and reprocessing.
            (2) Penalties.--If an IAEA Member State is determined to 
        have violated the prohibition on assistance to Iran described 
        in paragraph (1) before the IAEA Board of Governors determines 
        that Iran has satisfied the conditions described in 
        subparagraphs (A) through (C) of such paragraph, such Member 
        State shall be subject to the penalties described in subsection 
        (a)(3), shall be ineligible to receive nuclear material, 
        technology, equipment, or assistance from any IAEA Member 
        State, and shall be ineligible to receive any IAEA assistance 
        not related to safeguards inspections or nuclear security until 
        such time as the IAEA Board of Governors makes such 
        determination with respect to Iran.
    (f) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and annually for 2 years thereafter, the 
President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
report on the implementation of this section.

SEC. 803. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NUCLEAR SECURITY ACTION PLAN 
              OF THE IAEA.

    It is the sense of Congress that the national security interests of 
the United States are enhanced by the Nuclear Security Action Plan of 
the IAEA and that the Board of Governors should recommend, and the 
General Conference should adopt, a resolution incorporating the Nuclear 
Security Action Plan into the regular budget of the IAEA.

                         TITLE IX--PEACEKEEPING

SEC. 901. POLICY RELATING TO REFORM OF UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING 
              OPERATIONS.

    It shall be the policy of the United States to pursue reform of 
United Nations peacekeeping operations in the following areas:
            (1) Planning and management.--
                    (A) Global audit.--As the size, cost, and number of 
                United Nations peacekeeping operations have increased 
                substantially over the past decade, independent audits 
                of each such operation should be conducted annually, 
                with a view toward ``right-sizing'' operations and 
                ensuring that all operations are efficient and cost 
                effective.
                    (B) Procurement and transparency.--The logistics 
                established within the United Nations Department of 
                Field Support should be streamlined and strengthened to 
                ensure that all peacekeeping missions are resourced 
                appropriately, transparently, and in a timely fashion 
                while individual accountability for waste, fraud, and 
                abuse within United Nations peacekeeping missions is 
                uniformly enforced.
                    (C) Review of mandates and closing operations.--In 
                conjunction with the audit described in subparagraph 
                (A), the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping 
                Operations should conduct a comprehensive review of all 
                United Nations peacekeeping operation mandates, with a 
                view toward identifying objectives that are practical 
                and achievable, and report its findings to the Security 
                Council. In particular, the review should consider the 
                following:
                            (i) Except in extraordinary cases, 
                        including genocide, the United Nations 
                        Department of Peacekeeping Operations should 
                        not be tasked with activities that are 
                        impractical or unachievable without the 
                        cooperation of the Member State(s) hosting a 
                        United Nations peacekeeping operation, or which 
                        amount to de-facto trusteeship outside of the 
                        procedures established for such under Chapter 
                        XII of the United Nations Charter, thereby 
                        creating unrealistic expectations and 
                        obfuscating the primary responsibility of the 
                        Member States themselves for creating and 
                        maintaining conditions for peace.
                            (ii) Long-standing operations that are 
                        static and cannot fulfill their mandate should 
                        be downsized or closed.
                            (iii) Where there is legitimate concern 
                        that the withdrawal from a country of an 
                        otherwise static United Nations peacekeeping 
                        operation would result in the resumption of 
                        major conflict, a burden-sharing arrangement 
                        that reduces the level of assessed 
                        contributions, similar to that currently 
                        supporting the United Nations Peacekeeping 
                        Force in Cyprus, should be explored and 
                        instituted.
                    (D) Leadership.--As peacekeeping operations become 
                larger and increasingly complex, the Secretariat should 
                adopt a minimum standard of qualifications for senior 
                leaders and managers, with particular emphasis on 
                specific skills and experience, and current senior 
                leaders and managers who do not meet those standards 
                should be removed.
                    (E) Pre-deployment training.--Pre-deployment 
                training on interpretation of the mandate of the 
                operation, specifically in the areas of use of force, 
                civilian protection and field conditions, the Code of 
                Conduct, HIV/AIDS, and human rights should be 
                mandatory, and all personnel, regardless of category or 
                rank, should be required to sign an oath that each has 
                received and understands such training as a condition 
                of participation in the operation.
                    (F) Gratis military personnel.--The General 
                Assembly should seek to strengthen the capacity the 
                United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations 
                and ease the extraordinary burden currently placed upon 
                the limited number of headquarters staff by lifting 
                restrictions on the utilization of gratis military 
                personnel by the Department so that the Department may 
                accept secondments from Member States of military 
                personnel with expertise in mission planning, 
                logistics, and other operational specialties.
            (2) Conduct and discipline.--
                    (A) Adoption of a uniform code of conduct.--A 
                single, uniform Code of Conduct that has the status of 
                a binding rule and applies equally to all personnel 
                serving in United Nations peacekeeping operations, 
                regardless of category or rank, including military 
                personnel, should be adopted and incorporated into 
                legal documents governing participation in such an 
                operation, including all contracts and Memorandums of 
                Understanding, promulgated and effectively enforced.
                    (B) Understanding the code of conduct.--All 
                personnel, regardless of category or rank, should 
                receive training on the Code of Conduct prior to 
                deployment with a peacekeeping operation, in addition 
                to periodic follow-on training. In particular--
                            (i) all personnel, regardless of category 
                        or rank, should be provided with a personal 
                        copy of the Code of Conduct that has been 
                        translated into the national language of such 
                        personnel, regardless of whether such language 
                        is an official language of the United Nations;
                            (ii) all personnel, regardless of category 
                        or rank, should sign an oath that each has 
                        received a copy of the Code of Conduct, that 
                        each pledges to abide by the Code of Conduct, 
                        and that each understands the consequences of 
                        violating the Code of Conduct, including 
                        immediate termination of participation in and 
                        permanent exclusion from all current and future 
                        peacekeeping operations, as well as the 
                        assumption of personal liability and victims 
                        compensation, where appropriate, as a condition 
                        of appointment to any such operation; and
                            (iii) peacekeeping operations should 
                        continue and enhance educational outreach 
                        programs to reach local communities where 
                        peacekeeping personnel of such operations are 
                        based, including explaining prohibited acts on 
                        the part of United Nations peacekeeping 
                        personnel and identifying the individual to 
                        whom the local population may direct complaints 
                        or file allegations of exploitation, abuse, or 
                        other acts of misconduct.
                    (C) Monitoring mechanisms.--Dedicated monitoring 
                mechanisms, such as the Conduct and Discipline Teams 
                already deployed to support most United Nations 
                peacekeeping operations, should be present in each 
                operation to monitor compliance with the Code of 
                Conduct, and should report simultaneously to the Head 
                of Mission, the United Nations Department of Field 
                Support, the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping 
                Operations, and the Associate Director of the Office of 
                Internal Oversight Services for Peacekeeping 
                Operations.
                    (D) Investigations.--A permanent, professional, and 
                independent investigative body should be established 
                and introduced into United Nations peacekeeping 
                operations. In particular:
                            (i) The investigative body should include 
                        professionals with experience in investigating 
                        sex crimes and the illegal exploitation of 
                        resources, as appropriate, as well as experts 
                        who can provide guidance on standards of proof 
                        and evidentiary requirements necessary for any 
                        subsequent legal action.
                            (ii) Provisions should be included in all 
                        Memorandums of Understanding, including a Model 
                        Memorandum of Understanding, that obligate 
                        Member States that contribute troops to a 
                        peacekeeping operation to designate a military 
                        prosecutor who will participate in any 
                        investigation into credible allegations of 
                        misconduct brought against an individual of 
                        such Member State, so that evidence is 
                        collected and preserved in a manner consistent 
                        with the military law of such Member State.
                            (iii) The investigative body should be 
                        regionally based to ensure rapid deployment and 
                        should be equipped with modern forensics 
                        equipment for the purpose of positively 
                        identifying perpetrators and, where necessary, 
                        for determining paternity.
                            (iv) The investigative body should report 
                        directly to the Associate Director of the 
                        Office of Internal Oversight Services for 
                        Peacekeeping Operations, while providing copies 
                        of any reports to the Department of Field 
                        Support, the Department of Peacekeeping 
                        Operations, the Head of Mission, and the Member 
                        State concerned.
                    (E) Follow-up.--The Conduct and Discipline Unit in 
                the headquarters of the United Nations Department of 
                Field Support should be appropriately staffed, 
                resourced, and tasked with--
                            (i) promulgating measures to prevent 
                        misconduct;
                            (ii) receiving reports by field personnel 
                        and coordinating the Department's response to 
                        allegations of misconduct;
                            (iii) gathering follow-up information on 
                        completed investigations, particularly by 
                        focusing on disciplinary actions against the 
                        individual concerned that have been taken by 
                        the United Nations or by the individual's 
                        Member State, and sharing such information with 
                        the Security Council, the Department of 
                        Peacekeeping Operations, the Head of Mission, 
                        and the community hosting the peacekeeping 
                        operation; and
                            (iv) contributing pertinent data on conduct 
                        and discipline to the database required 
                        pursuant to subparagraph (H).
                    (F) Financial liability and victims assistance.--
                Although peacekeeping operations should provide 
                immediate medical assistance to victims of sexual abuse 
                or exploitation, the responsibility for providing 
                longer-term treatment, care, or restitution lies solely 
                with the individual found guilty of the misconduct. In 
                particular:
                            (i) The United Nations should not assume 
                        responsibility for providing long-term 
                        treatment or compensation under the Sexual 
                        Exploitation and Abuse Victim Assistance 
                        Mechanism by utilizing assessed contributions 
                        to United Nations peacekeeping operations, 
                        thereby shielding individuals from personal 
                        liability and reinforcing an atmosphere of 
                        impunity.
                            (ii) If an individual responsible for 
                        misconduct has been repatriated, reassigned, 
                        redeployed, or is otherwise unable to provide 
                        assistance, responsibility for providing 
                        assistance to a victim should be assigned to 
                        the Member State that contributed the 
                        contingent to which such individual belonged or 
                        to the manager concerned.
                            (iii) In the case of misconduct by a member 
                        of a military contingent, appropriate funds 
                        shall be withheld from the troop contributing 
                        country concerned.
                            (iv) In the case of misconduct by a 
                        civilian employee or contractor of the United 
                        Nations, appropriate wages shall be garnished 
                        from such individual or fines shall be imposed 
                        against such individual, consistent with 
                        existing United Nations Staff Rules, and 
                        retirement funds shall not be shielded from 
                        liability.
                    (G) Managers and commanders.--The manner in which 
                managers and commanders handle cases of misconduct by 
                those serving under them should be included in their 
                individual performance evaluations, so that managers 
                and commanders who take decisive action to deter and 
                address misconduct are rewarded, while those who create 
                a permissive environment or impede investigations are 
                penalized or relieved of duty, as appropriate.
                    (H) Database.--A centralized database, including 
                personnel photos, fingerprints, and biometric data, 
                should be created and maintained within the United 
                Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the 
                Department of Field Support, and other relevant United 
                Nations bodies without further delay to track cases of 
                misconduct, including the outcome of investigations and 
                subsequent prosecutions, to ensure that personnel who 
                have engaged in misconduct or other criminal 
                activities, regardless of category or rank, are 
                permanently barred from participation in future 
                peacekeeping operations.
                    (I) Cooperation of member states.--If a Member 
                State routinely refuses to cooperate with the 
                directives contained herein or acts to shield its 
                nationals from personal liability, that Member State 
                should be barred from contributing troops or personnel 
                to future peacekeeping operations.
                    (J) Welfare.--Peacekeeping operations should 
                continue to seek to maintain a minimum standard of 
                welfare for mission personnel to ameliorate conditions 
                of service, while adjustments are made to the 
                discretionary welfare payments currently provided to 
                Member States that contribute troops to offset the cost 
                of operation-provided recreational facilities, as 
                necessary and appropriate.

SEC. 902. CERTIFICATION.

    (a) New or Expanded Peacekeeping Operations Contingent Upon 
Presidential Certification of Peacekeeping Operations Reforms.--
            (1) No new or expanded peacekeeping operations.--
                    (A) Certification.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), until the Secretary certifies that 
                the requirements described in paragraph (2) have been 
                satisfied, the President shall direct the United States 
                Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use 
                the voice, vote, and influence of the United States at 
                the United Nations to oppose the creation of new, or 
                the expansion of existing, United Nations peacekeeping 
                operations.
                    (B) Exception and notification.--The requirements 
                described under paragraph (2) may be waived with 
                respect to a particular peacekeeping operation if the 
                President determines that failure to deploy new or 
                additional peacekeepers in such situation will 
                significantly contribute to the widespread loss of 
                human life, genocide, or the endangerment of a vital 
                national security interest of the United States. If the 
                President makes such a determination, the President 
                shall, not later than 15 days before the exercise of 
                such waiver, notify the appropriate congressional 
                committees of such determination and resulting waiver.
            (2) Certification of peacekeeping operations reforms.--The 
        certification referred to in paragraph (1) is a certification 
        made by the Secretary to the appropriate congressional 
        committees that the following reforms, or an equivalent set of 
        reforms, related to peacekeeping operations have been adopted 
        by the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations or 
        the General Assembly, as appropriate:
                    (A) A single, uniform Code of Conduct that has the 
                status of a binding rule and applies equally to all 
                personnel serving in United Nations peacekeeping 
                operations, regardless of category or rank, has been 
                adopted by the General Assembly and duly incorporated 
                into all contracts and a Model Memorandum of 
                Understanding, and mechanisms have been established for 
                training such personnel concerning the requirements of 
                the Code and enforcement of the Code.
                    (B) All personnel, regardless of category or rank, 
                serving in a peacekeeping operation have been trained 
                concerning the requirements of the Code of Conduct and 
                each has been given a personal copy of the Code, 
                translated into the national language of such 
                personnel.
                    (C) All personnel, regardless of category or rank, 
                are required to sign an oath that each has received a 
                copy of the Code of Conduct, that each pledges to abide 
                by the Code, and that each understands the consequences 
                of violating the Code, including immediate termination 
                of participation in and permanent exclusion from all 
                current and future peacekeeping operations, as well as 
                the assumption of personal liability for victims 
                compensation as a condition of the appointment to such 
                operation.
                    (D) All peacekeeping operations have designed and 
                implemented educational outreach programs to reach 
                local communities where peacekeeping personnel of such 
                operations are based to explain prohibited acts on the 
                part of United Nations peacekeeping personnel and to 
                identify the individual to whom the local population 
                may direct complaints or file allegations of 
                exploitation, abuse, or other acts of misconduct.
                    (E) The creation of a centralized database, 
                including personnel photos, fingerprints, and biometric 
                data, has been completed and is being maintained in the 
                United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations 
                that tracks cases of misconduct, including the outcomes 
                of investigations and subsequent prosecutions, to 
                ensure that personnel, regardless of category or rank, 
                who have engaged in misconduct or other criminal 
                activities are permanently barred from participation in 
                future peacekeeping operations.
                    (F) A Model Memorandum of Understanding between the 
                United Nations and each Member State that contributes 
                troops to a peacekeeping operation has been adopted by 
                the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping 
                Operations that specifically obligates each such Member 
                State to--
                            (i) uphold the uniform Code of Conduct 
                        which shall apply equally to all personnel 
                        serving in United Nations peacekeeping 
                        operations, regardless of category or rank;
                            (ii) designate a competent legal authority, 
                        preferably a prosecutor with expertise in the 
                        area of sexual exploitation and abuse where 
                        appropriate, to participate in any 
                        investigation into an allegation of misconduct 
                        brought against an individual of such Member 
                        State;
                            (iii) refer to its competent national or 
                        military authority for possible prosecution, if 
                        warranted, any investigation of a violation of 
                        the Code of Conduct or other criminal activity 
                        by an individual of such Member State;
                            (iv) report to the Department of Field 
                        Support and the Department of Peacekeeping 
                        Operations on the outcome of any such 
                        investigation;
                            (v) undertake to conduct on-site court 
                        martial proceedings, where practical and 
                        appropriate, relating to allegations of 
                        misconduct alleged against an individual of 
                        such Member State; and
                            (vi) assume responsibility for the 
                        provision of appropriate assistance to a victim 
                        of misconduct committed by an individual of 
                        such Member State.

                and audit function has been established within the 
                United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations
