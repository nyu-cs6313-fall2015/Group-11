Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of 2013 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to extend and reauthorize appropriations through FY2018 for payments to children's hospitals associated with operating approved graduate medical residency training programs.

Authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to: (1) make available up to 25 percent of the total amounts in excess of specified appropriations for payments to certain hospitals with a Medicare payment agreement that are excluded from the Medicare inpatient hospital prospective payment system and whose inpatients are predominantly under 18 years of age; and (2) establish a quality bonus system for distribution of excess payments to such hospitals, which may include a focus on quality measurement and improvement, interpersonal and communications skills, delivering patient-centered care, and practicing in integrated health systems.</summary>
