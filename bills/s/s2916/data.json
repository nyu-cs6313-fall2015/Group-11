Requires the Chief of the Forest Service to develop a national strategy to implement the Remediation Program.\n\nDirects the Forest Service to establish a Watershed Condition Framework within such region to:\n\n evaluate and classify the condition of watersheds, identify for restoration up to five priority watersheds in each National Forest and up to two priority watersheds in each national grassland, develop a watershed restoration action plan for each priority watershed, prioritize restoration activities for each watershed restoration action plan, implement each watershed restoration action plan, and monitor the effectiveness of restoration actions and indicators of watershed health.
