        not more than three years any provision under this subchapter 
        or sanctions imposed upon a State in accordance with subsection 
        (b)(2) upon the State's request for such a waiver if the

                or duplicative requirements preventing the effective 
                delivery of child care services to justify a waiver, 
                extraordinary circumstances, such as natural disaster 
                or financial crisis, or an extended period of time for 
                a State legislature to enact legislation to implement

                subchapter that the State seeks relief from;
                    ``(B) describe how a waiver from that sanction or 
                provision of this subchapter will, by itself, improve 
                delivery of child care services for children in the 
                State; and

        State's request under this subsection, the Secretary shall 
        inform the State of approval or disapproval of the request. If

        of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Health, 
        Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate of the reasons for

        request. In the case of approval, the Secretary shall, within 
        30 days of granting such waiver, notify and submit a report to 
        the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, 
        and Pensions of the Senate on the circumstances of the waiver

        reason as given by the State of the need for a waiver, and the 
        expected impact of the waiver on children served under this 
        program.

        this subsection for a period not to exceed three years, unless 
        a renewal is granted under paragraph (7).
            ``(6) Termination.--The Secretary shall terminate approval 
        of a request for a waiver authorized under this subsection if 
        the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for a 
        hearing, that the performance of a State granted relief under 
        this subsection has been inadequate, or if such relief is no 
        longer necessary to achieve its original purposes.
            ``(7) Renewal.--The Secretary may approve or disapprove a 
        request from a State for renewal of an existing waiver under 
        this subchapter for a period no longer than one year. A State 
        seeking to renew their waiver approval must inform the 
        Secretary of this intent no later than 30 days prior to the 
        expiration date of the waiver. The State shall re-certify in 
        its extension request the provisions in paragraph (2) of this 
        subchapter, and shall also explain the need for additional time 
        of relief from such sanction(s) or provisions approved under 
        this law as provided in this subchapter.
            ``(8) Restrictions.--Nothing in this subchapter shall be 
        construed as providing the Secretary the authority to permit 
        States to alter the eligibility requirements for eligible 
        children, including work requirements, job training, or 
        educational program participation, that apply to the parents of 
        eligible children under this subchapter. Nothing in this

        anything related to his or her authority under this 
        subchapter.''.
