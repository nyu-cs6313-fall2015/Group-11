              CONTINUING DISABILITY REVIEWS OR TIME LIMITING BENEFITS 
              FOR CERTAIN BENEFICIARIES.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Disability classifications.--Not later than 1 year 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commissioner 
        of Social Security shall establish a system for classifying any 
        individual who is determined to be entitled to disability 
        insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act or 
        to monthly benefits under section 202 of such Act by reason of 
        being under a disability in the following manner:
                    (A) An individual shall be classified as ``medical 
                improvement expected'' if the impairment or combination 
                of impairments causing the individual to be disabled is 
                expected to medically improve to the point where the 
                individual will no longer be disabled in 1 to 2 years.
                    (B) An individual shall be classified as ``medical 
                improvement likely'' if the impairment or combination 
                of impairments causing the individual to be disabled is 
                expected to medically improve to the point where the 
                individual will no longer be disabled in 3 to 5 years.
                    (C) An individual shall be classified as ``medical 
                improvement possible'' if the impairment or combination 
                of impairments causing the individual to be disabled is 
                not expected to medically improve to the point where 
                the individual will no longer be disabled in 5 years, 
                but future improvement is possible.
                    (D) An individual shall be classified as ``medical 
                improvement not expected'' if the individual has an 
                impairment or combination of impairments that is 
                chronic or progressive with permanent, irreversible 
                structural or functional loss, and for which there is 
                no known effective therapy, treatment, or surgical 
                intervention that could result in medical improvement 
                to the point where the individual is no longer 
                disabled.
            (2) Consideration of age.--In classifying an individual 
        under paragraph (1), the Commissioner of Social Security shall 
        not classify an individual as ``medical improvement not 
        expected'' solely by reason of such individual's age where a 
        lesser classification is appropriate.
    (b) Continuing Disability Reviews.--
            (1) In general.--Section 221(i) of the Social Security Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 421(i)) is amended--

    ``(1)(A) In the case of any individual who is determined to be 
under a disability and is classified as `medical improvement likely' or 
`medical improvement possible', the applicable State agency or the 
Commissioner of Social Security (as may be appropriate) shall, for 
purposes of continuing eligibility--
                    ``(i) if the individual is classified as `medical 
                improvement likely', conduct a review to determine 
                whether the individual remains under a disability 
                during the 5\th\ year following the first month after 
                the individual's waiting period (as defined in section 
                223(c)(2)); and
                    ``(ii) if the individual is classified as `medical

                whether the individual remains under a disability 
                during the 7\th\ year following the first month after 
                the individual's waiting period (as so defined).

        individual is classified under the system established by the 
        Commissioner of Social Security under section 102(a) of the 
        Protecting Social Security Disability Act of 2014, if the 
        Commissioner has reason to believe that an individual that has 
        been determined to be under a disability is not under a 
        disability, the Commissioner may review such individual's case 
        at such time and in such manner as the Commissioner determines 
        appropriate except that the Commissioner shall not initiate a 
        review on the basis of income earned by an individual who is a 
        participant in the Work Incentive Benefit System established 
        under section 223(l).

        under this paragraph shall be in addition to, and shall not be 
        considered as a substitute for, any other reviews which are

        section 221(i), evidence that would be sufficient to support a 
        finding in an initial determination that the individual is not 
        under a disability and is able to engage in substantial gainful 
        activity.''; and
                            (iii) by inserting ``, except that, in the

hearing under section 221(d), such individual may elect to have the

promulgate or revise, as appropriate, regulations relating to the 
determination, classification, and review of the disability status of

        doctrine, unless the individual voluntarily discloses such 
        communication to the Commissioner. Neither the attorney-client 
        privilege nor the work product doctrine shall prevent from 
        disclosure medical evidence, medical source opinions, or any 
        other factual matter that the Commissioner may consider in 
        determining whether or not the individual is entitled to 
        benefits.

        soon as practicable.

                    (A) develop the evidentiary record, and, if 
                necessary, work with the officials that made the 
                initial determination that the individual was not under 
                a disability to understand why such determination was 
                made;
                    (B) in cases where the individual has 
                representation, work with the representative to ensure 
                that the record is complete prior to the hearing, and 
                examine witnesses and present evidence to the 
                administrative law judge during the hearing;
                    (C) prior to the hearing, if the attorney finds 
                that the evidence clearly establishes that the 
                individual is under a disability, recommend that the 
                administrative law judge make a determination that the 
                individual is under a disability without requiring a 
                hearing; and
                    (D) after the hearing, if the attorney finds that 
                the evidence clearly does not support the determination 
                of the administrative law judge that the individual is 
                disabled, recommend to the Appeals Council of the 
                Office of Appellate Operations of the Social Security

                determination on its own motion.

                individual who elects to participate in the

                only identify an applicant for disability assistance as

                        applicant will be determined to be eligible 
                        disability assistance; and

                derived from the demonstration project will obtain

                        to Congress a report on the evaluation 
                        described in clause (i), including a 
                        recommendation as to whether the Commissioner's 
                        authority to conduct the demonstration project 
                        should be made permanent.
            (5) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                    (A) Commissioner.--The term ``Commissioner'' means 
                the Commissioner of Social Security.
                    (B) Demonstration project.--The term 
                ``demonstration project'' means the demonstration 
                project conducted under this subsection.
                    (C) Disability assistance.--The term ``disability 
                assistance'' means disability insurance benefits or 
                monthly benefits under section 202 of the Social 
                Security Act for which eligibility is based on a 
                disability.
                    (D) Eligible individual.--The term ``eligible 
                individual'' means an applicant for disability

        3111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in exchange for such 
        employer offering its employees private disability insurance 
        and other disability supports would be an effective means of 
        reducing the rate at which such employees enter the disability 
        insurance program established under title II of the Social 
        Security Act.

        analysis of the Commissioner's findings and recommendations for 
        further legislative or administrative action.
