Permits the Secretary to extend the loan under specified conditions if there is an outstanding balance after such period.\n\nProhibits the fee with respect to such loan from exceeding 3% of the ex-vessel value of the harvest from each fishery for which the loan is issued.\n\nSets forth requirements for direct loan interest rates, subloans, and the calculation of the ex-vessel landing fee to be collected for payment of such loan.\n\n(Sec. 4) Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within 75 days after enactment of this Act, to complete the referenda of fishery participants with respect to the terms for the refinanced loan."
