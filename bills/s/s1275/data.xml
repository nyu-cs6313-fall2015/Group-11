  <summary>9/10/2014--Reported to Senate amended.
Revitalizing the Economy of Fisheries in the Pacific Act or the REFI Pacific Act - (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of Commerce (upon receipt of such assurances as the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United States) to issue a loan to refinance the existing debt obligation funding the fishing capacity reduction program for the West Coast groundfish fishery implemented under the Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003.

Requires such loan to have a maturity that expires 45 years after the date of issuance. Permits the Secretary to extend the loan under specified conditions if there is an outstanding balance after such period.

Prohibits the fee with respect to such loan from exceeding 3% of the ex-vessel value of the harvest from each fishery for which the loan is issued.

Sets forth requirements for direct loan interest rates, subloans, and the calculation of the ex-vessel landing fee to be collected for payment of such loan.

(Sec. 4) Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within 75 days after enactment of this Act, to complete the referenda of fishery participants with respect to the terms for the refinanced loan.</summary>
