    (c) Establishing New Restricted Area.--If, on or after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary establishes any restricted area, 
the Secretary shall--
            (1) ensure that any restrictions are based on operational 
        conditions that create hazardous waters;
            (2) publish a draft describing the restricted area and seek 
        and consider public comment on that draft prior to establishing

            (3) not implement or enforce the restricted area until the 
        date that is 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act;

    (d) Exclusions.--For purposes of this section, the installation and 
maintenance of measures for alerting the public of hazardous water 
conditions and restricted areas, including sirens, strobe lights, and 
signage, shall not be considered to be a permanent physical barrier.
    (e) Enforcement.--
            (1) In general.--Enforcement of a restricted area shall be 
        the sole responsibility of the State in which the restricted 
        area is located.
            (2) Existing authorities.--The Secretary shall not assess 
        any penalty for entrance into a restricted area under section 4
