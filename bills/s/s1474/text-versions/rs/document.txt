of certain State laws by Indian tribes, to improve the quality of life 
   in rural Alaska, to reduce alcohol and drug abuse, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Safe Families and 
Villages Act of 2013''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) residents of remote Alaska villages suffer 
        disproportionately from crimes and civil disturbances rooted in 
        alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, suicide, and domestic 
        violence;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) the alcohol-related suicide rate in remote 
        Alaska villages is 6 times the average in the United States and 
        the alcohol-related mortality rate is 3.5 times that of the 
        general population of the United States;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) Alaska Native women suffer the highest rate of 
        forcible sexual assault in the United States and an Alaska 
        Native woman is sexually assaulted every 18 hours;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health 
        Consortium, one in two Alaska Native women experience physical 
        or sexual violence;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) according to the 2006 Initial Report and 
        Recommendations of the Alaska Rural Justice and Law Enforcement 
        Commission, more than 95 percent of all crimes committed in 
        rural Alaska can be attributed to alcohol abuse;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) the cost of drug and alcohol abuse in Alaska 
        is estimated at $525,000,000 per year;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) there are more than 200 remote villages in 
        Alaska, which are ancestral homelands to Indian tribes and 
        geographically isolated by rivers, oceans, and mountains making 
        most of those villages accessible only by air;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) small size and remoteness, lack of connection 
        to a road system, and extreme weather conditions often prevent 
        or delay travel, including that of law enforcement personnel, 
        into remote villages, resulting in challenging law enforcement 
        conditions;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) less than \1/2\ of remote Alaska villages are 
        served by trained State law enforcement entities and several 
        Indian tribes provide peace officers or tribal police without 
        adequate training or equipment;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) the lack of effective law enforcement 
        entities in remote Alaska villages contributes significantly to 
        increased crime, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, domestic violence, 
        rates of suicide, poor educational achievement, and lack of 
        economic development;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) Indian tribes that operate within remote 
        Alaska villages should be empowered to participate in local 
        culturally relevant solutions to effectively provide law 
        enforcement entities in villages and access to swift judicial 
        proceedings;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (12) increasing capacities of local law 
        enforcement entities to achieve increased tribal involvement in 
        State law enforcement in remote villages will promote a 
        stronger link between the State and village residents, 
        encourage community involvement, and create greater local 
        accountability with respect to violence and substance abuse; 
        and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (13) the United States has a trust responsibility 
        to Indian tribes in the State.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) to improve the delivery of justice in Alaska 
        Native villages by encouraging the State and Indian tribes to 
        enter into intergovernmental agreements relating to the 
        enforcement and adjudication of State laws relating to drug and 
        alcohol offenses; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) to enhance coordination and communication 
        among Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement 
        agencies.</DELETED>

        alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, suicide, and domestic 
        violence;
            (2) the alcohol-related suicide rate in remote Alaska 
        villages is 6 times the average in the United States and the 
        alcohol-related mortality rate is 3.5 times that of the general 
        population of the United States;
            (3) Alaska Native women suffer the highest rate of forcible 
        sexual assault in the United States and an Alaska Native woman 
        is sexually assaulted every 18 hours;
            (4) according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health 
        Consortium, one in two Alaska Native women experience physical 
        or sexual violence;
            (5) according to the 2006 Initial Report and 
        Recommendations of the Alaska Rural Justice and Law Enforcement 
        Commission, more than 95 percent of all crimes committed in 
        rural Alaska can be attributed to alcohol abuse;
            (6) the cost of drug and alcohol abuse in Alaska is 
        estimated at $525,000,000 per year;
            (7) there are more than 200 remote villages in Alaska, 
        which are ancestral homelands to Indian tribes and 
        geographically isolated by rivers, oceans, and mountains making 
        most of those villages accessible only by air;
            (8) small size and remoteness, lack of connection to a road 
        system, and extreme weather conditions often prevent or delay 
        travel, including that of law enforcement personnel, into 
        remote villages, resulting in challenging law enforcement 
        conditions and lack of ready access to the State judicial 
        system;
            (9) less than \1/2\ of remote Alaska villages are served by 
        trained State law enforcement entities and several Indian 
        tribes provide peace officers or tribal police without adequate 
        training or equipment;
            (10) the centralized State judicial system relies on 
        general jurisdiction Superior Courts in the regional hub 
        communities, with only a handful of staffed magistrate courts 
        outside of the hub communities;
            (11) the lack of effective law enforcement and accessible 
        judicial services in remote Alaska villages contributes 
        significantly to increased crime, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, 
        domestic violence, rates of suicide, poor educational 
        achievement, and lack of economic development;
            (12) Indian tribes that operate within remote Alaska 
        villages should be supported in carrying out local culturally 
        relevant solutions to effectively provide law enforcement in 
        villages and access to swift judicial proceedings;
            (13) increasing capacities of local law enforcement 
        entities to enforce local tribal laws and to achieve increased 
        tribal involvement in State law enforcement in remote villages 
        will promote a stronger link between the State and village 
        residents, encourage community involvement, and create greater 
        local accountability with respect to violence and substance 
        abuse;
            (14) the United States has a trust responsibility to Indian 
        tribes in the State;
            (15) the report of the Indian Law and Order Commission to 
        the President and Congress entitled ``A Roadmap to Making 
        Native America Safer'' and dated November 2013 found that the 
        crisis in criminal justice in the State is a national problem 
        and urged the Federal Government and the State to strengthen 
        tribal sovereignty and self-governance and for Congress to 
        create a jurisdictional framework to support tribal sovereignty 
        and expand the authority of Indian tribes in the State; and
            (16) it is necessary to invoke the plenary authority of 
        Congress over Indian tribes under article I, section 8, clause 
        3 of the Constitution to improve access to judicial systems in 
        remote Alaska Native villages and provide for the presence of 
        trained local law enforcement.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to improve the delivery of justice in Alaska Native 
        villages by--
                    (A) encouraging the State and Indian tribes to 
                enter into intergovernmental agreements relating to the 
                enforcement and adjudication of State laws relating to 
                drug and alcohol offenses; and
                    (B) supporting Indian tribes in the State in the 
                enforcement and adjudication of tribal laws relating to 
                child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, and drug 
                and alcohol offenses; and
            (2) to enhance coordination and communication among 
        Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies.
