    (a) Study Required.--The Comptroller General of the United States 
shall conduct a review of Department of Defense programs and 
organizations related to, and resourcing of, renewable energy research, 
development, and investment in pursuit of meeting the renewable energy 
goals set forth in section 2911(e) of title 10, United States Code, by 
Executive order, and through related legislative mandates. This review 
shall specify specific programs, costs, and estimated and expected 
savings of the programs.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees a report on the review conducted 
under subsection (a), including the following elements:
            (1) A description of current Department of Defense 
        renewable energy research initiatives throughout the Department 
        of Defense, by military service, including the use of any 
        ``renewable energy source'' as specified in section 2911(e)(2) 
        of title 10, United States Code. These descriptions shall 
        include the total dollars spent to date, the estimated total 
        cost of each program, and the estimated lifetime of each 
        program.
            (2) A description of current Department of Defense 
        renewable energy development initiatives throughout the 
        Department of Defense, by military service, including the use 
        of any ``renewable energy source'' as specified in section 
        2911(e)(2) of title 10, United States Code. These descriptions 
        shall include the total dollars spent to date, the estimated 
        total cost of each program, and the estimated lifetime of each 
        program.
            (3) A description of current Department of Defense 
        renewable energy investment initiatives throughout the 
        Department of Defense, by military service, including the use 
        of any ``renewable energy source'' as specified in section 
        2911(e)(2) of title 10, United States Code. These descriptions 
        will include the total dollars spent to date, the estimated 
        total cost of the program, and the estimated lifetime of the

        including a comparison of the renewable energy cost to the 
        current cost of conventional energy sources, as well as a 
        comparison of the renewable energy cost to the average energy 
        cost for the previous 10 years.
            (5) An assessment of the adequacy of the coordination by 
        the Department of Defense of planning for renewable energy 
        projects with consideration for savings realized for dollars 
        invested and the capitalization costs of such investments.
            (6) An assessment of the adequacy of the coordination by 
        the Department of Defense among the service branches and the 
        Department of Defense as a whole, and whether or not the 
        Department of Defense has a cost-effective, capabilities-based, 
        and coordinated renewable energy research, development, and 
        investment strategy.
            (7) An assessment of the programmatic, organizational, and

        strategy for the Department of Defense that provides the 
        Department with the energy supply required to meet all the 
        needs and capabilities of the Armed Forces in the most cost-
        effective and efficient manner.
