Supporting At-Risk Children Act -Title I: Strengthening and Finding Families for Children - Strengthening and Finding Families for Children Act - Subtitle A: Adoption Incentive Payments - (Sec. 111) Amends part E (Foster Care and Adoption Assistance) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to extend the adoption incentives grant program through FY2016.

(Sec. 112) Revises the program's award structure.

Repeals the state incentive-eligibility requirement that: (1) the number of foster child adoptions in the state during the fiscal year exceed the state's base number of foster child adoptions for the fiscal year, (B) the number of older child adoptions in the state during the fiscal year exceed the state's base number of older child adoptions for the fiscal year, or (C) the state's foster child adoption rate for the fiscal year exceed the highest ever foster child adoption rate determined for the state.

Replaces determination of numbers of adoptions based on Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) data with determination of the rates of adoptions and foster child guardianships.

Creates a new formula for determining adoption incentive payments. Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to increase the adoption incentive payment for timely adoption award states.

(Sec. 113) Renames the program the adoption and legal guardianship incentive program.

(Sec. 114) Requires states to use amounts paid to them under the program to supplement, and not supplant, any federal or non-federal funds used to provide any service under SSA title IV parts B (Child and Family Services) or E.

(Sec. 115) Requires a state to calculate the savings (if any) resulting from the application of specified eligibility requirements for adoption assistance to all applicable children for a fiscal year, using a methodology specified by the Secretary or an alternative methodology proposed by the state and approved by the Secretary.

Requires a state to spend at least 40% of any such savings on: (1) post-adoption or post-guardianship services (as applicable) for children placed in adoptive, kinship guardianship, or guardianship placements and their families; and (2) services to support and sustain positive permanent outcomes for children who otherwise might enter into foster care under the responsibility of the state.

(Sec. 116) Declares that, in the event of the death or incapacity of the relative guardian, the eligibility of a child for a kinship guardianship assistance payment shall not be affected by reason of the replacement of the relative guardian with a successor legal guardian named in the kinship guardianship assistance agreement.

(Sec. 117) Directs the Secretary, as part of the data collection system, to promulgate final regulations providing for the collection and analysis of information regarding children who enter into foster care under state supervision as a result of the disruption of a placement for adoption or foster care guardianship or the dissolution of an adoption or foster care guardianship.

(Sec. 118) Requires a state plan for foster care and adoption assistance to require the state, within 30 days after removal of a child from parental custody, to exercise due diligence to identify and provide notice to all parents of a sibling of such a child, where such parent has legal custody of such sibling (as well as all adult grandparents as under current law).

Subtitle B: Extension of Family Connection Grant Program - (Sec. 121) Amends SSA title IV part B to extend the Family Connection Grant Program through FY20016, and make universities eligible for matching grants under such programs.

(Sec. 212) Eliminates the option for children under age 16 to be eligible to be placed in another planned permanent living arrangement in cases where the state agency has documented to the state court a compelling reason for determining that it would not be in the best interests of the child to: (1) return home; (2) be referred for termination of parental rights; or (3) be placed for adoption, with a fit and willing relative, or with a legal guardian.

Prescribes additional case plan and case review system requirements for placement of a child in another planned permanent living arrangement, including: (1) documentation of intensive, ongoing, unsuccessful efforts for family placement; (2) court or administrative body redetermination of appropriateness of placement at each permanency hearing; and (3) demonstration of support for engaging in age or developmentally appropriate activities and social events.

Requires the state agency responsible for supervising a child's placement, if the child's permanency plan is another planned permanent living arrangement, to deposit the support amounts it has collected (without any reimbursement to the federal government) on a family's behalf in an account established for the child's benefit and used only for payment of fees or other costs attributable to the child's participation in age or developmentally appropriate activities (until age 18 or a higher age the state has elected).

Requires payment to the child of any amounts in such account once he or she attains age 18 or higher age, if elected by the state. Requires payment similarly to the child of any support amounts the state has collected for a child in foster care when he or she attains age 18 or older.

Subtitle B: Empowering Older Youth Vulnerable to Domestic Sex Trafficking and Other Negative Outcomes - (Sec. 221) Requires a permanency plan for a child age 14 or older to be developed in consultation with the child, and allows the child to choose up to two members of his or her case planning team.

(Sec. 222) Requires foster youth to be discharged from care only if provided with an official birth certificate, a Social Security card, a driver's license or equivalent state-issued identification care, and a fee-free (or low-fee) bank account. Subjects any state to an administrative penalty for noncompliance.

Requires a state plan also to contain a regularly updated description of the specific measures the state agency has taken to protect and provide services to such children, including efforts to coordinate with state law enforcement, juvenile justice, and social service agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters to serve that population.

Requires the AFCARS to provide comprehensive national information with respect to the number of children in foster care, or over whom the state agency has responsibility for placement, care, or supervision, who are identified as victims of sex trafficking or of severe forms of trafficking in persons.
