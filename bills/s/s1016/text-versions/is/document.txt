    To protect individual privacy against unwarranted governmental

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving Freedom from Unwarranted 
Surveillance Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act--
            (1) the term ``drone'' has the meaning given the term 
        ``unmanned aircraft'' in section 331 of the FAA Modernization 
        and Reform Act of 2012 (49 U.S.C. 40101 note); and
            (2) the term ``law enforcement party'' means a person or 
        entity authorized by law, or funded by the Government of the 
        United States, to investigate or prosecute offenses against the 
        United States.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITED USE OF DRONES.

    Except as provided in section 4, a person or entity acting under 
the authority, or funded in whole or in part by, the Government of the 
United States shall not use a drone to gather evidence or other 
information pertaining to criminal conduct or conduct in violation of a 
statute or regulation except to the extent authorized in a warrant that 
satisfies the requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States.

SEC. 4. EXCEPTIONS.

    This Act does not prohibit any of the following:
            (1) Patrol of borders.--The use of a drone to patrol 
        national borders to prevent or deter illegal entry of any 
        persons or illegal substances.
            (2) Exigent circumstances.--The use of a drone by a law 
        enforcement party when exigent circumstances exist. For the 
        purposes of this paragraph, exigent circumstances exist when 
        the law enforcement party possesses reasonable suspicion that 
        under particular circumstances, swift action to prevent 
        imminent danger to the life of an individual is necessary.
            (3) High risk.--The use of a drone to counter a high risk 
        of a terrorist attack by a specific individual or organization, 
        when the Secretary of Homeland Security determines credible 
        intelligence indicates there is such a risk.

SEC. 5. REMEDIES FOR VIOLATION.

    Any aggrieved party may in a civil action obtain all appropriate 
relief to prevent or remedy a violation of this Act.

SEC. 6. PROHIBITION ON USE OF EVIDENCE.

admissible as evidence in a criminal prosecution in any court of law in 
the United States.
