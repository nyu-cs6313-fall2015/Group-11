                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

                                 An Act


 
  To authorize the President to extend the term of the nuclear energy 
       agreement with the Republic of Korea until March 19, 2016.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Support for United States-Republic 
of Korea Civil Nuclear Cooperation Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) In the 60th year of the alliance, the relationship between 
    the United States and the Republic of Korea could not be stronger. 
    It is based on mutual sacrifice, mutual respect, shared interests, 
    and shared responsibility to promote peace and security in the 
    Asia-Pacific region and throughout the world.
        (2) North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, including uranium 
    enrichment and plutonium reprocessing technologies, undermine 
    security on the Korean Peninsula. The United States and the 
    Republic of Korea have a shared interest in preventing further 
    proliferation, including through the implementation of the 2005 
    Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks.
        (3) Both the United States and Republic of Korea have a shared 
    objective in strengthening the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
    Nuclear Weapons, done at London, Moscow, and Washington July 1, 
    1968, and a political and a commercial interest in working 
    collaboratively to address challenges to their respective peaceful 
    civil nuclear programs.
        (4) The nuclear energy agreement referred to in section 3 is 
    scheduled to expire on March 19, 2014. In order to maintain healthy 
    and uninterrupted cooperation in this area between the two 
    countries while a new agreement is being negotiated, Congress 
    should authorize the President to extend the duration of the 
    current agreement until March 19, 2016.
SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF NUCLEAR ENERGY AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF 
KOREA.
    Notwithstanding section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 
U.S.C. 2153), the President is authorized to take such actions as may 
be required to extend the term of the Agreement for Cooperation between 
the Government of the United States of America and the Government of 
the Republic of Korea Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy, done at 
Washington November 24, 1972 (24 UST 775; TIAS 7583), and amended on 
May 15, 1974 (25 UST 1102; TIAS 7842), to a date that is not later than 
March 19, 2016.
SEC. 4. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON PROGRESS OF NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND REPUBLIC OF KOREA.
    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, and every 180 days thereafter until a new Agreement for 
Cooperation between the Government of the United States of America and 
the Government of the Republic of Korea Concerning Civil Uses of 
Nuclear Energy is submitted to Congress, the President shall provide to 
the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations 
of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on 
Appropriations of the House of Representatives a report on the progress 
of negotiations on a new civil nuclear cooperation agreement.

                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.
