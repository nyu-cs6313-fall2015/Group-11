State Trade and Export Promotion Utilization Program for American Small Businesses Act or the STEP UP for American Small Businesses Act - Amends the Small Business Act to direct the Associate Administrator for International Trade within the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a State Trade and Export Promotion Grant Program.

Authorizes the Associate Administrator to make competitive grants to states to carry out export promotion programs to increase: (1) the number of eligible small businesses that export (including rural small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by women and socially and economically disadvantaged individuals), as well as (2) the value of their exports.

Amends the Export Enhancement Act of 1988 to require the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) to include one or more members appointed by the President who are representatives of state trade promotion agencies.</summary>
