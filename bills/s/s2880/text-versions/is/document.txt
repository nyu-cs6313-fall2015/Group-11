                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a tax incentive 
to individuals teaching in elementary and secondary schools located in 
    rural or high unemployment areas and to individuals who achieve 
    certification from the National Board for Professional Teaching 
                   Standards, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Incentives to Educate American 
Children Act of 2014'' or the ``I Teach Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States classrooms are increasingly filled 
        with less experienced teachers, as elderly teachers retire and 
        the retention rate among young teachers continues to decrease. 
        The most common number of years of teaching experience for 
        public school teachers has decreased from 15 years experience 
        in 1987-1988 to 5 years in 2011-2012. According to the most 
        recent data, 1,700,000 teachers, representing 45 percent of the 
        workforce, had less than 10 years of experience. Students 
        deserve teachers with more experience and training.
            (2) Recent research confirms that additional years of 
        teaching experience at the same grade level (up to 20 years) 
        add a direct positive impact on student achievement.
            (3) The most recent data (2011-2012) from the National 
        Center for Education Statistics find 32.8 percent of public 
        schools in the United States are in rural areas. The associated 
        costs rural schools face mean that they often have less money 
        for instructional costs and salaries. Department of Education 
        data show that rural school districts have the lowest base 
        salaries for starting teachers, a trend that continues even as 
        teachers move to the top of the local salary range. Rural 
        schools face these challenges across the country.
            (4) The most recent study by the Education Trust found that 
        high schools with high poverty rates are twice as likely to 
        have teachers that are not certified in their fields than high 
        schools with low poverty rates. The same study found that high 
        poverty schools have a higher percentage of first year 
        teachers. Rural schools face similar problems.
            (5) According to the most recent statistics by the Bureau 
        of Labor Statistics and the Department of Education, teachers 
        are paid on average only 79 percent as much as other college 
        graduates.
            (6) The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards 
        was founded in 1987 as a follow up to the landmark 1983 report, 
        ``A Nation at Risk'', by the Carnegie Task Force on Teaching. 
        The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards is an 
        independent, nonprofit, and nonpartisan organization, whose 
        mission is to establish high and rigorous standards for what 
        accomplished teachers should know and be able to do.
            (7) Over 100,000 teachers from all 50 States and the 
        District of Columbia have completed certification by the 
        National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, where 
        certification is a rigorous assessment process for teachers.
            (8) The National Research Council (NRC) of the National 
        Academies has affirmed that students taught by National Board 
        certified teachers make higher gains on achievement tests than 
        those taught by teachers who have not applied for or have not 
        achieved certification.
            (9) According to the National Commission on Teaching and 
        America's Future, 15.7 percent of teachers leave their jobs 
        each year, compared to an annual turnover rate of 11.9 percent 
        in other professions. The average cost of recruiting, hiring, 
        preparing, and losing a teacher is approximately $50,000.
            (10) The NRC found in 2008 that the average retention rate 
        for National Board certified teachers is higher than the rate 
        for teachers who have not achieved certification. Specifically, 
        in a study focusing on the first 4 to 7 years of teaching, the 
        NRC found that nearly \3/4\ of National Board certified 
        teachers remained in the profession at the end of the study, 
        compared to only \2/3\ of non-certified teachers that stayed 
        teaching during the same time period.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            (1) To encourage teachers, through a refundable tax credit, 
        to work in public elementary and secondary schools located in 
        rural areas or schools with high poverty.
            (2) To provide an additional tax credit to teachers who 
        achieve certification from the National Board for Professional 
        Teaching Standards in order to recruit and retain highly 
        qualified teachers in public elementary and secondary schools.

SEC. 3. REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR INDIVIDUALS TEACHING IN ELEMENTARY
