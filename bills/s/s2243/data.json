Expands services to caregivers of veterans under such program to include\u00a0child care services, financial planning services, and legal services.\n\nAuthorizes the transfer of entitlement to post 9/11 education assistance to family members by veterans who are retired for a physical disability or\u00a0who are seriously injured veterans in need of family caregiver services, without regard to length-of-service requirements.\n\nAuthorizes the VA Secretary to pay monthly special compensation to seriously injured or ill veterans in need of personal care services and to their caregivers. Excludes from gross income, for income tax purposes, such compensation paid to injured or ill veterans.\n\nAuthorizes\u00a0flexible work schedules or telework\u00a0for federal employees who are caregivers of veterans.\n\nAmends the Public Health Service Act to\u00a0designate a veteran participating in the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers as an adult with a special need for purposes of the\u00a0lifespan respite care program.\n\nEstablishes in the executive branch an interagency working group to review and report on policies relating to the caregivers of veterans and members of the Armed Forces.\n\nDirects the Secretary to provide for studies on members of the Armed Forces who commenced service after September 11, 2001, and veterans who have incurred a serious injury or illness, including a mental health injury, and their caregivers."
