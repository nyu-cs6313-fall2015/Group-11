                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal a certain exemption for 
             hydraulic fracturing, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fracturing Responsibility and 
Awareness of Chemicals Act'' or the ``FRAC Act''.

SEC. 2. REGULATION OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING.

    (a) Underground Injection.--Section 1421(d) of the Safe Drinking 
Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300h(d)) is amended by striking paragraph (1) and 
inserting the following:
            ``(1) Underground injection.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `underground injection' 
                means the subsurface emplacement of fluids by well 
                injection.
                    ``(B) Inclusion.--The term `underground injection' 
                includes the underground injection of fluids or 
                propping agents pursuant to hydraulic fracturing 
                operations relating to oil or natural gas production 
                activities.
                    ``(C) Exclusion.--The term `underground injection' 
                does not include the underground injection of natural 
                gas for the purpose of storage.''.
    (b) State Primary Enforcement Relating to Hydraulic Fracturing 
Operations.--Section 1422 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 
300h-1) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(f) Hydraulic Fracturing Operations.--
            ``(1) In general.--Consistent with such regulations as the 
        Administrator may prescribe, a State may seek primary 
        enforcement responsibility for hydraulic fracturing operations 
        for oil and natural gas without seeking to assume primary 
        enforcement responsibility for other types of underground 
        injection control wells, including underground injection 
        control wells that inject brine or other fluids that are 
        brought to the surface in connection with oil and natural gas 
        production or any underground injection for the secondary or 
        tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas.
            ``(2) Administration.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply 
                until the date that is 1 year after the date on which 
                the Administrator publishes in the Federal Register any 
                regulations promulgated under that paragraph.
                    ``(B) Effect on administrator.--Nothing in this 
                subsection affects the authority of the Administrator 
                to approve State programs that assume primary 
                enforcement responsibility for only certain types of 
                underground injection control wells.''.
    (c) Disclosure.--Section 1421(b) of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 
U.S.C. 300h(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(4) Disclosures of chemical constituents.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A person conducting hydraulic

                Administrator has primary enforcement responsibility in 
                a State), by not later than such deadlines as shall be
