Requires the cost of rolling stock components and subcomponents produced in the United States to increase from 60% in FY2013 by 10% annual increments up to 100% for FY2017 and ensuing fiscal years. Revises waiver requirements as well to mirror those for federal-aid highways.\n\nApplies the rail grant Buy American requirements under this Act to recipients of rail loans and loan guarantees with respect to railroad rehabilitation and improvement.\n\nPrescribes Buy American requirements for procurement of a facility or equipment under federal aviation programs similar to those for rolling stock.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to report annually to Congress on: (1) each project for which a waiver of Buy American requirements was issued; and (2) the country of origin and product specifications for steel, iron, or manufactured goods acquired pursuant to each waiver.\n\nAmends the Safe Drinking Water Act to prescribe Buy American requirements for steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the construction of a public water system.\n\nAdds similar Buy American requirements to the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, with respect to economic development programs, and to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, with respect to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation Grant Program.\n\nAmends the Truman-Hobbs Act to prescribe Buy American requirements for steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in the alteration of a bridge over U.S. navigable waters."
