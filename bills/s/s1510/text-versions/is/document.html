_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To provide for auditable financial statements for the Department of 
                    Defense, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Audit the Pentagon Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Section 9 of Article I of the Constitution of the 
        United States requires all agencies of the Federal Government, 
        including the Department of Defense, to publish ``a regular 
        statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all 
        public money''.
            (2) Section 3515 of title 31, United States Code, requires 
        the agencies of the Federal Government, including the 
        Department of Defense, to present auditable financial 
        statements beginning not later than March 1, 1997. The 
        Department has not complied with this law.
            (3) The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 
        1996 (31 U.S.C. 3512 note) requires financial systems acquired 
        by the Federal Government, including the Department of Defense, 
        to be able to provide information to leaders to manage and 
        control the cost of Government. The Department has not complied 
        with this law.
            (4) The financial management of the Department of Defense 
        has been on the ``High-Risk'' list of the Government 
        Accountability Office, which means that the Department is not 
        consistently able to ``control costs; ensure basic 
        accountability; anticipate future costs and claims on the 
        budget; measure performance; maintain funds control; [and] 
        prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse''.
            (5) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
        2002 (Public Law 107-107) requires the Secretary of Defense to 
        report to Congress annually on the reliability of the financial 
        statements of the Department of Defense, to minimize resources 
        spent on producing unreliable financial statements, and to use 
        resources saved to improve financial management policies, 
        procedures, and internal controls.
            (6) In 2005, the Department of Defense created a Financial 
        Improvement and Audit Readiness (FIAR) Plan, overseen by a 
        directorate within the office of the Under Secretary of Defense 
        (Comptroller), to improve Department business processes with 
        the goal of producing timely, reliable, and accurate financial 
        information that could generate an audit-ready annual financial 
        statement. In December 2005, that directorate, known as the 
        FIAR Directorate, issued the first of a series of semiannual 
        reports on the status of the Financial Improvement and Audit 
        Readiness Plan.
            (7) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
        2010 (Public Law 111-84) requires regular status reports on the 
        Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan described in 
        paragraph (6), and codified as a statutory requirement the goal 
        of the Plan in ensuring that Department of Defense financial 
        statements are validated as ready for audit not later than 
        September 30, 2017. In addition, the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law 112-239) 
        requires that the statement of budgetary resources of the 
        Department of Defense be validated as ready for audit by not 
        later than September 30, 2014.
            (8) At a September 2010 hearing of the Senate, the 
        Government Accountability Office stated that past expenditures 
        by the Department of Defense of $5,800,000,000 to improve 
        financial information, and billions of dollars more of 
        anticipated expenditures on new information technology systems 
        for that purpose, may not suffice to achieve full audit 
        readiness of the financial statement of the Department. At that 
        hearing, the Government Accountability Office could not predict 
        when the Department would achieve full audit readiness of such 
        statements.
            (9) At a 2013 hearing of the Senate, Secretary of Defense 
        Chuck Hagel affirmed his commitment to audit-ready budget 
        statements for the Department of Defense by the end of 2014, 
        and stated that he ``will do everything he can to fulfill this 
        commitment''. At that hearing, Secretary Hagel noted that 
        auditable financial statements were essential to the Department 
        not only for improving the quality of its financial 
        information, but also for reassuring the public and Congress 
        that it is a good steward of public funds.
