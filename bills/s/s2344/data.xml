RETURNED FOR REVISIONS

Justice for Amy Act of 2014 - Amends federal criminal code provisions concerning mandatory restitution to require a court to apply the principle of aggregate causation to determine the full amount of the victim's losses caused by a child pornography offense and all related sexual abuse offenses committed by all persons against the victim.

Makes a defendant convicted of such an offense jointly and severally liable for the victim's losses. Requires each defendant found jointly and severally liable to pay an equal percentage of such losses.

Allows: (1) a defendant convicted of such an offense to bring a civil action in U.S. district court, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, for contribution against all other persons who have committed such an offense against the victim; and (2) a person who has been held jointly or severally liable in a civil action to bring suit in U.S. district court for contribution against all others who have committed such an offense against the victim.

Directs the Attorney General to submit to Congress a report on the efforts of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to collect restitution for victims of child pornography.</summary>
