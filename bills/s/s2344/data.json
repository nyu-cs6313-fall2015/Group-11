Requires each defendant found jointly and severally liable to pay an equal percentage of such losses.\n\nAllows: (1) a defendant convicted of such an offense to bring a civil action in U.S. district court, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, for contribution against all other persons who have committed such an offense against the victim; and (2) a person who has been held jointly or severally liable in a civil action to bring suit in U.S. district court for contribution against all others who have committed such an offense against the victim.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to submit to Congress a report on the efforts of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to collect restitution for victims of child pornography."
