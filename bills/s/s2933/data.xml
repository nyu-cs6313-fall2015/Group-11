  <summary>11/17/2014--Introduced.
Amends the federal criminal code to prohibit knowingly using an electronic tracking device to determine the location or movement of an individual with the intent to place the individual under surveillance without such individual's consent, except: (1) by a law enforcement agency if the use is not otherwise prohibited by law, (2) by an individual to track a dependent of the individual, or (3) to reasonably protect the health or safety of the individual being tracked.

Defines "electronic tracking device" to mean a device attached to a vehicle that reveals the location or movement of the device through the transmission of electronic signals.</summary>
