  <summary>7/22/2014--Introduced.
Amends the Truth in Lending Act with respect to the permission that a creditor may presume that a residential mortgage loan has met the requirement that, at the time the loan is consummated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay it, if the loan is a qualified mortgage.

Treats as a qualified mortgage any residential mortgage loan made by a creditor having less than $10 billion in total assets, so long as it appears on the creditor's balance sheet (held on portfolio).</summary>
