                                 A BILL


 
    To declare the November 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas, a 
  terrorist attack, and to ensure that the victims of the attack and 
their families receive the same honors and benefits as those Americans 
  who have been killed or wounded in a combat zone overseas and their 
                               families.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Honoring the Fort Hood Heroes Act''.

SEC. 2. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.

    Congress makes the following declarations of policy:
            (1) The November 5, 2009, attack at Fort Hood, Texas 
        constituted an act of terrorism, not merely workplace violence.
            (2) The United States Government has a fundamental duty to 
        our military service members to safeguard them against 
        avoidable harm in the course of their service, and the attack 
        on Fort Hood could and should have been prevented.
            (3) Nidal Hasan, the perpetrator of the attack, had become 
        radicalized while serving in the United States Army and was 
        principally motivated to carry out the attack by an ideology of 
        violent Islamist extremism.
            (4) Through his actions that day, Nidal Hasan proved 
        himself to be not just a terrorist, but also a traitor and an 
        enemy of the United States.
