  <summary>12/9/2013--Introduced.
General Duty Clarification Act of 2013 - Amends the Clean Air Act, with respect to provisions relating to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous air pollutants, to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to: (1) promulgate final regulations establishing criteria defining the terms "extremely hazardous substance," "appropriate hazard assessment techniques," and "design and maintain a safe facility"; and (2) issue guidelines to ensure enforcement of such provisions by the regional offices of EPA in a uniform and appropriate manner across all regions of the United States.

Modifies the definition of "accidental release" to exclude an emission resulting from an act intended to cause harm.</summary>
