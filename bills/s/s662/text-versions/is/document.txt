        the case may be, reasonably suggests that covered merchandise 
        has been entered into the customs territory of the United 
        States through evasion.
            ``(2) Allegation described.--An allegation described in 
        this paragraph is an allegation that a person has entered

        other Federal agency, including the Department of Commerce or 
        the United States International Trade Commission, that 
        reasonably suggests that a person has entered covered 
        merchandise into the customs territory of the United States 
        through evasion.
            ``(4) Consolidation of allegations and referrals.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Commissioner may consolidate

                receives the first such allegation or referral shall be 
                used for purposes of the requirement under paragraph 
                (1) with respect to the timing of the initiation of the 
                investigation.
            ``(5) Information-sharing to protect health and safety.--
        If, during the course of conducting an investigation under 
        paragraph (1) with respect to covered merchandise, the 
        Commissioner has reason to suspect that such covered 
        merchandise may pose a health or safety risk to consumers, the

                of entry, including accepting entries of merchandise, 
                collecting duties, and enforcing the customs and trade 
                laws of the United States; and
                    (B) to perform those functions 24 hours a day.
    (b) Designation.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the President shall, after considering the 
criteria set forth in subsection (c) and any input provided by the 
public, designate not fewer than 2 and not more than 6 land border 
crossings, equally divided between land border crossings on the 
northern and southern borders of the United States, as 24-hour 
commercial ports of entry under the pilot program established under 
subsection (a).
    (c) Criteria.--In designating a land border crossing as a 24-hour 
commercial port of entry under the pilot program established under 
subsection (a), the President shall consider the following:
            (1) The number of 24-hour commercial ports of entry already 
        located in the State in which the land border crossing is 
        located.
            (2) The costs associated with operating the land border 
        crossing as a 24-hour commercial port of entry, including 
        whether the Federal Government would be required to acquire or 
        lease additional land.
            (3) The positive economic impact of designating the land 
        border crossing as a 24-hour commercial port of entry on the 
        community in which the land border crossing is located.
            (4) Any commitment of resources by the government of Canada 
        or Mexico, as applicable, to a similar designation of a 
        corresponding foreign port of entry.
            (5) The support demonstrated by the government of the State 
        or locality in which the land border crossing is located, 
        including through infrastructure improvements, to facilitate 
        the operation of the land border crossing as a 24-hour 
        commercial port of entry.
    (d) Termination.--
            (1) Determination of economic benefit.--Not later than the 
        date that is 2 years after the date on which a land border 
        crossing designated as a 24-hour commercial port of entry under 
        the pilot program established under subsection (a) becomes 
        fully operational as a 24-hour commercial port of entry, the 
        President shall--
                    (A) determine whether the operation of the land 
                border crossing as a port of entry 24 hours a day 
                provides a net economic benefit to the United States; 
                and
                    (B) submit to the Committee on Finance of the 
                Senate and Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
                Representatives a report on that determination and the 
                reasons for that determination.
            (2) Termination.--If the President determines under 
        paragraph (1) that operating a land border crossing as a port 
        of entry 24 hours a day does not provide a net economic benefit 
        to the United States, the land border crossing shall cease to 
        operate as a port of entry 24 hours a day on the date on which 
        the President submits the report under paragraph (1)(B).
    (e) Report.--Not later than 90 days before the President makes a 
determination under subsection (d)(1) with respect to a land border 
crossing designated as a 24-hour commercial port of entry under the 
pilot program established under subsection (a), the President shall 
submit to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and Committee on Ways 
and Means of the House of Representatives a report that provides--
            (1) a comparison of the vehicle traffic, the estimated 
        total volume of commercial merchandise entered, and the wait 
        times at the land border crossing--
                    (A) during the 2-year period preceding the 
                designation of the land border crossing as a 24-hour 
                commercial port of entry; and
                    (B) after the land border crossing becomes fully 
                operational as a 24-hour commercial port of entry;
            (2) a comparison of the total value of commercial 
        merchandise transported through the land border crossing--
                    (A) during the 2-year period preceding the 
                designation of the land border crossing as a 24-hour 
                commercial port of entry; and
                    (B) after the land border crossing becomes fully 
                operational as a 24-hour commercial port of entry; and
            (3) a comparison of wait times at other ports of entry in 
        the State in which the land border crossing is located--
                    (A) during the 2-year period preceding the 
                designation of the land border crossing as a 24-hour 
                commercial port of entry; and
                    (B) after the land border crossing becomes fully
