SEC. 2903. PROCEDURE FOR MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BASE CLOSURES AND 
              REALIGNMENTS.

    (a) Force-Structure Plan and Infrastructure Inventory.--
            (1) Preparation and submission.--As part of the budget 
        justification documents submitted to Congress in support of the 
        budget for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017, the 
        Secretary shall submit to Congress the following:
                    (A) A force-structure plan for the armed forces 
                based on an assessment by the Secretary of the probable 
                threats to the national security during the 20-year 
                period beginning with that fiscal year, the probable 
                end-strength levels and major military force units 
                (including land force divisions, carrier and other 
                major combatant vessels, air wings, and other 
                comparable units) needed to meet these threats, and the 
                anticipated levels of funding that will be available 
                for national defense purposes during such period.
                    (B) A comprehensive inventory of military 
                installations worldwide for each military department, 
                with specifications of the number and type of 
                facilities in the active and reserve forces of each 
                military department.
            (2) Relationship of plan and inventory.--Using the force-
        structure plan and infrastructure inventory prepared under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall prepare (and include as part 
        of the submission of such plan and inventory) the following:
                    (A) A description of the infrastructure necessary 
                to support the force structure described in the force-
                structure plan.
                    (B) A discussion of categories of excess 
                infrastructure and infrastructure capacity.
                    (C) An economic analysis of the effect of the 
                closure or realignment of military installations to 
                reduce excess infrastructure.
            (3) Special considerations.--In determining the level of 
        necessary versus excess infrastructure under paragraph (2), the 
        Secretary shall consider the following:
                    (A) The anticipated continuing need for and 
                availability of military installations outside the 
                United States, taking into account current restrictions 
                on the use of military installations outside the United 
                States and the potential for future prohibitions or 
                restrictions on the use of such military installations.
                    (B) Any efficiencies that may be gained from joint 
                tenancy by more than one branch of the armed forces at 
                a military installation.
            (4) Revision.--The Secretary may revise the force-structure 
        plan and infrastructure inventory. If the Secretary makes such 
        a revision, the Secretary shall submit the revised plan or 
        inventory to Congress not later than March 15th of the year 
        following the year in which such plan was first submitted. For 
        purposes of selecting military installations for closure or 
        realignment under this title in the year in which a revision is 
        submitted, no revision of the force-structure plan or 
        infrastructure inventory is authorized after that date.
    (b) Certification of Need for Further Closures and Realignments.--
            (1) Certification required.--On the basis of the force-
        structure plan and infrastructure inventory prepared under 
        subsection (a) and the descriptions and economic analysis 
        prepared under such subsection, the Secretary shall include as 
        part of the submission of the plan and inventory--
                    (A) a certification regarding whether the need 
                exists for the closure or realignment of additional 
                military installations; and
                    (B) if such need exists, a certification that the 
                additional round of closures and realignments would 
                result in annual net savings for each of the military 
                departments beginning not later than six years 
                following the commencement of such closures and 
                realignments.
            (2) Effect of failure to certify.--If the Secretary does 
        not include the certifications referred to in paragraph (1), 
        the President may not commence a round for the selection of 
        military installations for closure and realignment under this 
        title in the year following submission of the force-structure 
        plan and infrastructure inventory.
    (c) Comptroller General Evaluation.--
            (1) Evaluation required.--If the certification is provided 
        under subsection (b), the Comptroller General shall prepare an 
        evaluation of the following:
                    (A) The force-structure plan and infrastructure 
                inventory prepared under subsection (a) and the final 
                selection criteria specified in paragraph (d), 
                including an evaluation of the accuracy and analytical 
                sufficiency of such plan, inventory, and criteria.
                    (B) The need for the closure or realignment of 
                additional military installations.
            (2) Submission.--The Comptroller General shall submit the 
        evaluation to Congress not later than 60 days after the date on 
        which the force-structure plan and infrastructure inventory are 
        submitted to Congress.
    (d) Final Selection Criteria.--
            (1) In general.--The final criteria to be used by the 
        Secretary in making recommendations for the closure or 
        realignment of military installations inside the United States 
        under this title in 2017 shall be the military value and other 
        criteria specified in paragraphs (2) and (3).
            (2) Military value criteria.--The military value criteria 
        are as follows:
                    (A) The current and future mission capabilities and 
                the impact on operational readiness of the total force 
                of the Department of Defense, including the impact on 
                joint warfighting, training, and readiness.
                    (B) The availability and condition of land, 
                facilities, and associated airspace (including training 
                areas suitable for maneuver by ground, naval, or air 
                forces throughout a diversity of climate and terrain 
                areas and staging areas for the use of the armed forces 
                in homeland defense missions) at both existing and 
                potential receiving locations.
                    (C) The ability to accommodate contingency, 
                mobilization, surge, and future total force 
                requirements at both existing and potential receiving 
                locations to support operations and training.
                    (D) The cost of operations and the manpower 
                implications.
            (3) Other criteria.--The other criteria that the Secretary 
        shall use in making recommendations for the closure or 
        realignment of military installations inside the United States 
        under this title in 2017 are as follows:
                    (A) The extent and timing of potential costs and 
                savings, including the number of years, beginning with 
                the date of completion of the closure or realignment, 
                for the savings to exceed the costs.
                    (B) The economic impact on existing communities in 
                the vicinity of military installations.
                    (C) The ability of the infrastructure of both the 
                existing and potential receiving communities to support 
                forces, missions, and personnel.
                    (D) The environmental impact, including the impact 
                of costs related to potential environmental 
                restoration, waste management, and environmental 
                compliance activities.
    (e) Priority Given to Military Value.--The Secretary shall give 
priority consideration to the military value criteria specified in 
subsection (d)(2) in the making of recommendations for the closure or 
realignment of military installations.
    (f) Effect on Department and Other Agency Costs.--The selection 
criteria relating to the cost savings or return on investment from the 
proposed closure or realignment of military installations shall take 
into account the effect of the proposed closure or realignment on the 
costs of any other activity of the Department of Defense or any other 
Federal agency that may be required to assume responsibility for 
activities at the military installations.
    (g) Relation to Other Materials.--The final selection criteria 
specified in this section shall be the only criteria to be used, along 
with the force-structure plan and infrastructure inventory referred to 
in subsection (a), in making recommendations for the closure or 
realignment of military installations inside the United States under 
this title in 2017.
    (h) DOD Recommendations.--(1) If the Secretary makes the 
certifications required under subsection (b), the Secretary shall, by 
no later than May 12, 2017, publish in the Federal Register and

    (C) For purposes of subparagraph (B), in the case of a community 
anticipating the economic effects of a closure or realignment of a 
military installation, advance conversion planning--
            (i) shall include community adjustment and economic 
        diversification planning undertaken by the community before an 
        anticipated selection of a military installation in or near the

SEC. 2905. IMPLEMENTATION.

    (a) In General.--(1) In closing or realigning any military 
installation under this title, the Secretary may--
            (A) take such actions as may be necessary to close or 
        realign any military installation, including the acquisition of 
        such land, the construction of such replacement facilities, the 
        performance of such activities, and the conduct of such advance 
        planning and design as may be required to transfer functions 
        from a military installation being closed or realigned to 
        another military installation, and may use for such purpose 
        funds in the Account or funds appropriated to the Department of 
        Defense for use in planning and design, minor construction, or 
        operation and maintenance;
            (B) provide--
                    (i) economic adjustment assistance to any community 
                located near a military installation being closed or 
                realigned, and
                    (ii) community planning assistance to any community 
                located near a military installation to which functions 
                will be transferred as a result of the closure or 
                realignment of a military installation,
        if the Secretary of Defense determines that the financial 
        resources available to the community (by grant or otherwise) 
        for such purposes are inadequate, and may use for such purposes 
        funds in the Account or funds appropriated to the Department of 
        Defense for economic adjustment assistance or community 
        planning assistance;
            (C) carry out activities for the purposes of environmental 
        restoration and mitigation at any such installation, and shall 
        use for such purposes funds in the Account;
            (D) provide outplacement assistance to civilian employees 
        employed by the Department of Defense at military installations 
        being closed or realigned, and may use for such purpose funds 
        in the Account or funds appropriated to the Department of 
        Defense for outplacement assistance to employees; and
            (E) reimburse other Federal agencies for actions performed 
        at the request of the Secretary with respect to any such 
        closure or realignment, and may use for such purpose funds in 
        the Account or funds appropriated to the Department of Defense 
        and available for such purpose.
    (2) In carrying out any closure or realignment under this title, 
the Secretary shall ensure that environmental restoration of any 
property made excess to the needs of the Department of Defense as a 
result of such closure or realignment be carried out as soon as 
possible with funds available for such purpose.

    (2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) and paragraphs (3), (4), (5), 
and (6), the Secretary of Defense shall exercise the authority 
delegated to the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) in accordance 
with--
            (i) all regulations governing the utilization of excess 
        property and the disposal of surplus property under subtitle I 
        of title 40, United States Code; and
            (ii) all regulations governing the conveyance and disposal 
        of property under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act of 
        1944 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622(g)).
    (B) The Secretary may, with the concurrence of the Administrator of 
General Services--
            (i) prescribe general policies and methods for utilizing 
        excess property and disposing of surplus property pursuant to 
        the authority delegated under paragraph (1); and
            (ii) issue regulations relating to such policies and 
        methods, which shall supersede the regulations referred to in 
        subparagraph (A) with respect to that authority.
    (C) The Secretary of Defense may transfer real property or 
facilities located at a military installation to be closed or realigned 
under this title, with or without reimbursement, to a military

instrumentality) within the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard.
    (D) Before any action may be taken with respect to the disposal of 
any surplus real property or facility located at any military

of Defense shall consult with the Governor of the State and the heads 
of the local governments concerned for the purpose of considering any 
plan for the use of such property by the local community concerned.
    (E) If a military installation to be closed, realigned, or placed 
in an inactive status under this title includes a road used for public 
access through, into, or around the installation, the Secretary of 
Defense shall consult with the Governor of the State and the heads of 
the local governments concerned or the purpose of considering the 
continued availability of the road for public use after the 
installation is closed, realigned, or placed in an inactive status.
    (3)(A) Not later than 6 months after the date of approval of the 
closure or realignment of a military installation under this title, the 
Secretary, in consultation with the redevelopment authority with 
respect to the installation, shall--
            (i) inventory the personal property located at the 
        installation; and
            (ii) identify the items (or categories of items) of such 
        personal property that the Secretary determines to be related 
        to real property and anticipates will support the 
        implementation of the redevelopment plan with respect to the 
        installation.
    (B) If no redevelopment authority referred to in subparagraph (A) 
exists with respect to an installation, the Secretary shall consult 
with--
            (i) the local government in whose jurisdiction the 
        installation is wholly located; or
            (ii) a local government agency or State government agency 
        designated for the purpose of such consultation by the chief 
        executive officer of the State in which the installation is 
        located.
    (C)(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (E) and (F), the 
Secretary may not carry out any of the activities referred to in clause 
(ii) with respect to an installation referred to in that clause until 
the earlier of--
            (I) one week after the date on which the redevelopment plan 
        for the installation is submitted to the Secretary;
            (II) the date on which the redevelopment authority notifies 
        the Secretary that it will not submit such a plan;
            (III) twenty-four months after the date of approval of the 
        closure or realignment of the installation; or
            (IV) ninety days before the date of the closure or 
        realignment of the installation.
    (ii) The activities referred to in clause (i) are activities 
relating to the closure or realignment of an installation to be closed 
or realigned under this title as follows:
            (I) The transfer from the installation of items of personal 
        property at the installation identified in accordance with 
        subparagraph (A).
            (II) The reduction in maintenance and repair of facilities 
        or equipment located at the installation below the minimum 
        levels required to support the use of such facilities or 
        equipment for nonmilitary purposes.
    (D) Except as provided in paragraph (4), the Secretary may not 
transfer items of personal property located at an installation to be 
closed or realigned under this title to another installation, or 
dispose of such items, if such items are identified in the 
redevelopment plan for the installation as items essential to the reuse 
or redevelopment of the installation. In connection with the 
development of the redevelopment plan for the installation, the 
Secretary shall consult with the entity responsible for developing the 
redevelopment plan to identify the items of personal property located 
at the installation, if any, that the entity desires to be retained at 
the installation for reuse or redevelopment of the installation.
    (E) This paragraph shall not apply to any personal property located 
at an installation to be closed or realigned under this title if the 
property--
            (i) is required for the operation of a unit, function, 
        component, weapon, or weapons system at another installation;
            (ii) is uniquely military in character, and is likely to 
        have no civilian use (other than use for its material content 
        or as a source of commonly used components);
            (iii) is not required for the reutilization or 
        redevelopment of the installation (as jointly determined by the 
        Secretary and the redevelopment authority);
            (iv) is stored at the installation for purposes of 
        distribution (including spare parts or stock items); or
            (v)(I) meets known requirements of an authorized program of 
        another Federal department or agency for which expenditures for 
        similar property would be necessary; and
            (II) is the subject of a written request by the head of the 
        department or agency.
    (F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (C)(i) and (D), the Secretary may 
carry out any activity referred to in subparagraph (C)(ii) or (D) if 
the Secretary determines that the carrying out of such activity is in 
the national security interest of the United States.
    (4)(A) The Secretary may transfer real property and personal 
property located at a military installation to be closed or realigned 
under this title to the redevelopment authority with respect to the 
installation for purposes of job generation on the installation.
    (B) The transfer of property located at a military installation 
under subparagraph (A) may be for consideration at or below the 
estimated fair market value or without consideration. The determination 
of such consideration may account for the economic conditions of the 
local affected community and the estimated costs to redevelop the 
property. The Secretary may accept, as consideration, a share of the 
revenues that the redevelopment authority receives from third-party 
buyers or lessees from sales and long-term leases of the conveyed 
property, consideration in kind (including goods and services), real 
property and improvements, or such other consideration as the Secretary 
considers appropriate. The transfer of property located at a military 
installation under subparagraph (A) may be made for consideration below 
the estimated fair market value or without consideration only if the 
redevelopment authority with respect to the installation--
            (i) agrees that the proceeds from any sale or lease of the 
        property (or any portion thereof) received by the redevelopment 
        authority during at least the first seven years after the date 
        of the initial transfer of property under subparagraph (A) 
        shall be used to support the economic redevelopment of, or 
        related to, the installation; and
            (ii) executes the agreement for transfer of the property 
        and accepts control of the property within a reasonable time 
        after the date of the property disposal record of decision or 
        finding of no significant impact under the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
    (C) For purposes of subparagraph (B)(i), the use of proceeds from a 
sale or lease described in such subparagraph to pay for, or offset the 
costs of, public investment on or related to the installation for any 
of the following purposes shall be considered a use to support the 
economic redevelopment of, or related to, the installation:
            (i) Road construction.
            (ii) Transportation management facilities.
            (iii) Storm and sanitary sewer construction.
            (iv) Police and fire protection facilities and other public 
        facilities.
            (v) Utility construction.

            (vii) Historic property preservation.
            (viii) Pollution prevention equipment or facilities.
            (ix) Demolition.
            (x) Disposal of hazardous materials generated by 
        demolition.
            (xi) Landscaping, grading, and other site or public 
        improvements.
            (xii) Planning for or the marketing of the development and 
        reuse of the installation.
    (D) The Secretary may recoup from a redevelopment authority such 
portion of the proceeds from a sale or lease described in subparagraph 
(B) as the Secretary determines appropriate if the redevelopment 
authority does not use the proceeds to support economic redevelopment 
of, or related to, the installation for the period specified in 
subparagraph (B).
    (E)(i) The Secretary may transfer real property at an installation 
approved for closure or realignment under this title (including 
property at an installation approved for realignment which will be 
retained by the Department of Defense or another Federal agency after 
realignment) to the redevelopment authority for the installation if the 
redevelopment authority agrees to lease, directly upon transfer, one or 
more portions of the property transferred under this subparagraph to 
the Secretary or to the head of another department or agency of the 
Federal Government. Subparagraph (B) shall apply to a transfer under 
this subparagraph.
    (ii) A lease under clause (i) shall be for a term of not to exceed 
50 years, but may provide for options for renewal or extension of the 
term by the department or agency concerned.
    (iii) A lease under clause (i) may not require rental payments by 
the United States.
    (iv) A lease under clause (i) shall include a provision specifying 
that if the department or agency concerned ceases requiring the use of 
the leased property before the expiration of the term of the lease, the 
remainder of the lease term may be satisfied by the same or another 
department or agency of the Federal Government using the property for a 
use similar to the use under the lease. Exercise of the authority 
provided by this clause shall be made in consultation with the 
redevelopment authority concerned.
    (v) Notwithstanding clause (iii), if a lease under clause (i) 
involves a substantial portion of the installation, the department or 
agency concerned may obtain facility services for the leased property 
and common area maintenance from the redevelopment authority or the 
redevelopment authority's assignee as a provision of the lease. The 
facility services and common area maintenance shall be provided at a 
rate no higher than the rate charged to non-Federal tenants of the 
transferred property. Facility services and common area maintenance 
covered by the lease shall not include--
            (I) municipal services that a State or local government is 
        required by law to provide to all landowners in its 
        jurisdiction without direct charge; or
            (II) firefighting or security-guard functions.
    (F) The transfer of personal property under subparagraph (A) shall 
not be subject to the provisions of subchapters II and III of chapter 5 
of title 40, United States Code, if the Secretary determines that the 
transfer of such property is necessary for the effective implementation 
of a redevelopment plan with respect to the installation at which such 
property is located.
    (G) The provisions of section 120(h) of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 
U.S.C. 9620(h)) shall apply to any transfer of real property under this 
paragraph.
    (H) The Secretary may require any additional terms and conditions 
in connection with a transfer under this paragraph as such Secretary 
considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.
    (5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the 
Secretary shall take such actions as the Secretary determines necessary 
to ensure that final determinations under paragraph (1) regarding 
whether another department or agency of the Federal Government has 
identified a use for any portion of a military installation to be 
closed or realigned under this title, or will accept transfer of any 
portion of such installation, are made not later than 6 months after 
the date of approval of closure or realignment of that installation.
    (B) The Secretary may, in consultation with the redevelopment 
authority with respect to an installation, postpone making the final 
determinations referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to the 
installation for such period as the Secretary determines appropriate if 
the Secretary determines that such postponement is in the best 
interests of the communities affected by the closure or realignment of 
the installation.
    (C)(i) Before acquiring non-Federal real property as the location 
for a new or replacement Federal facility of any type, the head of the 
Federal agency acquiring the property shall consult with the Secretary 
regarding the feasibility and cost advantages of using Federal property 
or facilities at a military installation closed or realigned or to be 
closed or realigned under this title as the location for the new or 
replacement facility. In considering the availability and suitability 
of a specific military installation, the Secretary and the head of the 
Federal agency involved shall obtain the concurrence of the 
redevelopment authority with respect to the installation and comply 
with the redevelopment plan for the installation.
    (ii) Not later than 30 days after acquiring non-Federal real 
property as the location for a new or replacement Federal facility, the 
head of the Federal agency acquiring the property shall submit to 
Congress a report containing the results of the consultation under 
clause (i) and the reasons why military installations referred to in 
such clause that are located within the area to be served by the new or 
replacement Federal facility or within a 200-mile radius of the new or 
replacement facility, whichever area is greater, were considered to be 
unsuitable or unavailable for the site of the new or replacement 
facility.
    (6)(A) The disposal of buildings and property located at 
installations approved for closure or realignment under this title 
shall be carried out in accordance with this paragraph.
    (B)(i) Not later than the date on which the Secretary of Defense 
completes the final determinations referred to in paragraph (5) 
relating to the use or transferability of any portion of an 
installation covered by this paragraph, the Secretary shall--
            (I) identify the buildings and property at the installation 
        for which the Department of Defense has a use, for which 
        another department or agency of the Federal Government has 
        identified a use, or of which another department or agency will 
        accept a transfer;
            (II) take such actions as are necessary to identify any 
        building or property at the installation not identified under 
        subclause (I) that is excess property or surplus property;
            (III) submit to the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
        Development and to the redevelopment authority for the 
        installation (or the chief executive officer of the State in 
        which the installation is located if there is no redevelopment 
        authority for the installation at the completion of the 
        determination described in the stem of this sentence)

the buildings or property, or any portion thereof, at the installation 
that are identified under subparagraph (B)(i)(II). A notice of interest 
under this clause shall describe the need of the government, 
representative, or party concerned for the buildings or property 
covered by the notice.
    (ii) The redevelopment authority for an installation shall assist 
the governments, representatives, and parties referred to in clause (i)

            (II) in the case of an installation for which a 
        redevelopment authority is not recognized as of such date, not

        facilities agrees to pay the difference between the fair market 
        value and such costs.
    (3) In the case of property or facilities covered by a 
certification under paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary may pay the 
recipient of such property or facilities an amount equal to the lesser 
of--
            (A) the amount by which the costs incurred by the recipient

SEC. 2908. CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF COMMISSION REPORT.

    (a) Terms of the Resolution.--For purposes of section 2904(b), the

President transmits the report to the Congress under section 2903(j), 
and--
            (1) which does not have a preamble;

Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives. A 
resolution described in subsection (a) introduced in the Senate shall 
be referred to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate.
    (c) Discharge.--If the committee to which a resolution described in 
subsection (a) is referred has not reported such a resolution (or an 
identical resolution) by the end of the 20-day period beginning on the 
date on which the President transmits the report to the Congress under 
section 2903(j), such committee shall be, at the end of such period, 
discharged from further consideration of such resolution, and such

involved.
    (d) Consideration.--(1) On or after the third day after the date on 
which the committee to which such a resolution is referred has 
reported, or has been discharged (under subsection (c)) from further 
consideration of, such a resolution, it is in order (even though a 
previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any 
Member of the respective House to move to proceed to the consideration 
of the resolution. A member may make the motion only on the day after 
the calendar day on which the Member announces to the House concerned 
the Member's intention to make the motion, except that, in the case of 
the House of Representatives, the motion may be made without such prior 
announcement if the motion is made by direction of the committee to 
which the resolution was referred. All points of order against the 
resolution (and against consideration of the resolution) are waived. 
The motion is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and is

opposing the resolution. An amendment to the resolution is not in 
order. A motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. 
A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of 
other business, or a motion to recommit the resolution is not in order. 
A motion to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or 
disagreed to is not in order.
    (3) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a 
resolution described in subsection (a) and a single quorum call at the 
conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of 
the appropriate House, the vote on final passage of the resolution 
shall occur.
    (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, 
as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution described 
in subsection (a) shall be decided without debate.
    (e) Consideration by Other House.--(1) If, before the passage by 
one House of a resolution of that House described in subsection (a), 
that House receives from the other House a resolution described in 
subsection (a), then the following procedures shall apply:
            (A) The resolution of the other House shall not be referred 
        to a committee and may not be considered in the House receiving 
        it except in the case of final passage as provided in 
        subparagraph (B)(ii).
            (B) With respect to a resolution described in subsection 
        (a) of the House receiving the resolution--
                    (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same 
                as if no resolution had been received from the other 
                House; but
                    (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the 
                resolution of the other House.
    (2) Upon disposition of the resolution received from the other 
House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the resolution that 
originated in the receiving House.
    (f) Rules of the Senate and House.--This section is enacted by 
Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of a resolution described in subsection 
        (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it 
        is inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.
