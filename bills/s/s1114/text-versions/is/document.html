                or any public entity within the territory of a country 
                is providing, directly or indirectly, a countervailable 
                subsidy as described in section 771(5), if--
                            ``(i) a petition filed by an interested

of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677), as amended by section 10(b), is further 
amended by adding at the end the following:

        countervailing duty investigation under subtitle A of this 
        title, or a review under subtitle C of this title, the 
        following shall apply:
                    ``(A) In general.--If the administering authority 
                determines to investigate whether currency 
                undervaluation is a countervailable subsidy as defined 
                in section 771(5), the administering authority shall 
                determine whether there is a benefit to the recipient 
                and measure such benefit by comparing the simple 
                average of the real exchange rates derived from 
                application of the macroeconomic-balance approach and 
                the equilibrium-real-exchange-rate approach to the 
                official daily exchange rate identified by the

                available, reliable, and compiled and maintained by the 
                International Monetary Fund or the World Bank, or other 
                international organizations or national governments if 
                data from the International Monetary Fund or World Bank

                currency for priority action pursuant to section 
                4(a)(3) of the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform 
                Act of 2013, the administering authority shall 
                determine whether there is a benefit to the recipient 
                and measure that benefit by comparing the nominal value 
                associated with the medium-term equilibrium exchange 
                rate of the currency of the exporting country, 
                identified by the Secretary pursuant to section 3(b)(7) 
                of such Act, to the official daily exchange rate 
                identified by the administering authority.

                        term `macroeconomic-balance approach' means a

                        rate of the currency of the exporting country 
                        is defined as the change in the real effective

new sentence: ``The fact that a subsidy may also be provided in 
circumstances that do not involve export shall not, for that reason 
alone, mean that the subsidy cannot be considered contingent upon

VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.) and reviews 
initiated under subtitle C of title VII of such Act (19 U.S.C. 1675 et
