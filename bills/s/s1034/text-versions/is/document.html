                awarded, but such jurisdiction is subject to time 
                limits as follows:
            ``(A) A protest based upon alleged improprieties in a 
        solicitation that are apparent before bid opening or the time 
        set for receipt of initial proposals shall be filed before bid 
        opening or the time set for receipt of initial proposals. In 
        the case of a procurement where proposals are requested, 
        alleged improprieties that do not exist in the initial 
        solicitation but that are subsequently incorporated into the 
        solicitation shall be protested not later than the next closing 
        time for receipt of proposals following the incorporation. A 
        protest that meets these time limitations that was previously 
        filed with the Comptroller General may not be reviewed.
            ``(B) A protest other than one covered by subparagraph (A) 
        shall be filed not later than 10 days after the basis of the 
        protest is known or should have been known (whichever is 
        earlier), with the exception of a protest challenging a 
        procurement conducted on the basis of competitive proposals 
        under which a debriefing is requested and, when requested, is 
        required. In such a case, with respect to any protest the basis 
        of which is known or should have been known either before or as 
        a result of the debriefing, the initial protest shall not be 
        filed before the debriefing date offered to the protester, but 
        shall be filed not later than 10 days after the date on which 
        the debriefing is held.
            ``(C) If a timely agency-level protest was previously 
        filed, any subsequent protest to the United States Court of 
        Federal Claims that is filed within 10 days of actual or 
        constructive knowledge of initial adverse agency action shall 
        be considered, if the agency-level protest was filed in 
        accordance with subparagraphs (A) and (B), unless the 
        contracting agency imposes a more stringent time for filing the 
        protest, in which case the agency's time for filing shall 
        control. In a case where an alleged impropriety in a 
        solicitation is timely protested to a contracting agency, any 
        subsequent protest to the United States Court of Federal Claims 
        shall be considered timely if filed within the 10-day period 
        provided by this subparagraph, even if filed after bid opening 
        or the closing time for receipt of proposals.
            ``(D) A protest untimely on its face shall be dismissed. A 
        protester shall include in its protest all information 
        establishing the timeliness of the protest; a protester shall 
        not be permitted to introduce for the first time in a motion 
        for reconsideration information necessary to establish that the 
        protest was timely. Under no circumstances may the United 
        States Court of Federal Claims consider a protest that is 
        untimely because it was first filed with the Government 
        Accountability Office.''.
    (b) Available Relief.--Paragraph (2) of such section is amended by 
inserting ``monetary relief shall not be available if injunctive relief 
is or has been granted, and'' after ``except that''.
    (c) Agency Decisions Overriding Stay of Contract Award or 
Performance.--Such section is further amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (5) and (6) as paragraphs 
        (6) and (7), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new 
        paragraph (5):
    ``(5) The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have 
jurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an interested party 
challenging an agency's decision to override a stay of contract award 
or contract performance that would otherwise be required by section 
3553 of title 31.''.
    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to any cause of action filed 180 days or more after the date of 
the enactment of this Act.

            (1) Use of royalties.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), 
        any royalties or other payments received by the department from

agreement of the private sector organization concerned, arrange for the 
temporary assignment of an employee to such private sector 
organization, or from such private sector organization to a Department 
of Defense organization under this section. An employee shall be

        exceptional employee; and

        equivalent).
    (b) Agreements.--The Secretary of Defense shall provide for a 
written agreement among the Department of Defense, the private sector 
organization, and the employee concerned regarding the terms and 
conditions of the employee's assignment under this section. The 
agreement--

        Department of Defense, that upon completion of the assignment, 
        the employee will serve in the civil service for a period at 
        least equal to three times the length of the assignment, unless 
        the employee is sooner involuntarily separated from the service 
        of the employee's agency; and

        Defense or of the private sector organization (as the case may 
        be) fails to carry out the agreement, or if the employee is 
        voluntarily separated from the service of the employee's agency 
        before the end of the period stated in the agreement, such 
        employee shall be liable to the United States for payment of 
        all expenses of the assignment unless that failure or voluntary 
        separation was for good and sufficient reason, as determined by 
        the Secretary of Defense.
An amount for which an employee is liable under paragraph (2) shall be 
treated as a debt due the United States. The Secretary may waive, in 
whole or in part, collection of such a debt based on a determination 
that the collection would be against equity and good conscience and not 
in the best interests of the United States.

                injuries; and

        a Department of Defense organization, to any trade secrets or

        decontamination is practicable and economically feasible

        economically feasible, or that the land cannot be 
        decontaminated sufficiently to be opened to operation of some

        relinquishment, or if at the expiration of the withdrawal and 
        reservation made by such subchapter the Secretary of the 
        Interior determines that some of the lands withdrawn and 
        reserved by such subchapter are contaminated to an extent which 
        prevents opening such contaminated lands to operation of the 
        public land laws--

                appropriate steps to warn the public of the

              REALIGNMENTS.

    (a) Force-Structure Plan and Infrastructure Inventory.--
            (1) Preparation and submission.--As part of the budget 
        justification documents submitted to Congress in support of the 
        budget for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2015, the 
        Secretary shall submit to Congress the following:
                    (A) A force-structure plan for the Armed Forces 
                based on an assessment by the Secretary of the probable 
                threats to the national security during the 20-year 
                period beginning with that fiscal year, the probable 
                end-strength levels and major military force units 
                (including land force divisions, carrier and other 
                major combatant vessels, air wings, and other 
                comparable units) needed to meet these threats, and the 
                anticipated levels of funding that will be available 
                for national defense purposes during such period.
                    (B) A comprehensive inventory of military 
                installations worldwide for each military department, 
                with specifications of the number and type of 
                facilities in the active and reserve forces of each 
                military department.
            (2) Relationship of plan and inventory.--Using the force-
        structure plan and infrastructure inventory prepared under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall prepare (and include as part 
        of the submission of such plan and inventory) the following:
                    (A) A description of the infrastructure necessary 
                to support the force structure described in the force-
                structure plan.
                    (B) A discussion of categories of excess 
                infrastructure and infrastructure capacity.
                    (C) An economic analysis of the effect of the 
                closure or realignment of military installations to 
                reduce excess infrastructure.
            (3) Special considerations.--In determining the level of 
        necessary versus excess infrastructure under paragraph (2), the 
        Secretary shall consider the following:
                    (A) The anticipated continuing need for and 
                availability of military installations outside the 
                United States, taking into account current restrictions 
                on the use of military installations outside the United 
                States and the potential for future prohibitions or 
                restrictions on the use of such military installations.
                    (B) Any efficiencies that may be gained from joint 
                tenancy by more than one branch of the Armed Forces at 
                a military installation.
            (4) Revision.--The Secretary may revise the force-structure 
        plan and infrastructure inventory. If the Secretary makes such 
        a revision, the Secretary shall submit the revised plan or 
        inventory to Congress not later than March 15th of the year 
        following the year in which such plan was first submitted. For 
        purposes of selecting military installations for closure or 
        realignment under this title in the year in which a revision is 
        submitted, no revision of the force-structure plan or 
        infrastructure inventory is authorized after that date.
    (b) Certification of Need for Further Closures and Realignments.--
            (1) Certification required.--On the basis of the force-
        structure plan and infrastructure inventory prepared under 
        subsection (a) and the descriptions and economic analysis 
        prepared under such subsection, the Secretary shall include as 
        part of the submission of the plan and inventory--
                    (A) a certification regarding whether the need 
                exists for the closure or realignment of additional 
                military installations; and
                    (B) if such need exists, a certification that the 
                additional round of closures and realignments would 
                result in annual net savings for each of the military 
                departments beginning not later than six years 
                following the commencement of such closures and 
                realignments.
            (2) Effect of failure to certify.--If the Secretary does 
        not include the certifications referred to in paragraph (1), 
        the President may not commence a round for the selection of 
        military installations for closure and realignment under this 
        title in the year following submission of the force-structure 
        plan and infrastructure inventory.
    (c) Comptroller General Evaluation.--
            (1) Evaluation required.--If the certification is provided 
        under subsection (b), the Comptroller General shall prepare an 
        evaluation of the following:
                    (A) The force-structure plan and infrastructure 
                inventory prepared under subsection (a) and the final 
                selection criteria specified in paragraph (d), 
                including an evaluation of the accuracy and analytical 
                sufficiency of such plan, inventory, and criteria.
                    (B) The need for the closure or realignment of 
                additional military installations.
            (2) Submission.--The Comptroller General shall submit the 
        evaluation to Congress not later than 60 days after the date on 
        which the force-structure plan and infrastructure inventory are 
        submitted to Congress.
    (d) Final Selection Criteria.--
            (1) In general.--The final criteria to be used by the 
        Secretary in making recommendations for the closure or 
        realignment of military installations inside the United States 
        under this title in 2015 shall be the military value and other 
        criteria specified in paragraphs (2) and (3).
            (2) Military value criteria.--The military value criteria 
        are as follows:

    (D) Except as provided in paragraph (4), the Secretary may not 
transfer items of personal property located at an installation to be 
closed or realigned under this title to another installation, or

        redevelopment of the installation (as jointly determined by the 
        Secretary and the redevelopment authority);
            (iv) is stored at the installation for purposes of 
        distribution (including spare parts or stock items); or
            (v)(I) meets known requirements of an authorized program of 
        another Federal department or agency for which expenditures for 
        similar property would be necessary, and
            (II) is the subject of a written request by the head of the 
        department or agency.
    (F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (C)(i) and (D), the Secretary may

installation for purposes of job generation on the installation.
    (B) The transfer of property located at a military installation 
under subparagraph (A) may be for consideration at or below the 
estimated fair market value or without consideration. The determination 
of such consideration may account for the economic conditions of the 
local affected community and the estimated costs to redevelop the 
property. The Secretary may accept, as consideration, a share of the 
revenues that the redevelopment authority receives from third-party 
buyers or lessees from sales and long-term leases of the conveyed 
property, consideration in kind (including goods and services), real 
property and improvements, or such other consideration as the Secretary 
considers appropriate. The transfer of property located at a military 
installation under subparagraph (A) may be made for consideration below 
the estimated fair market value or without consideration only if the 
redevelopment authority with respect to the installation--
            (i) agrees that the proceeds from any sale or lease of the 
        property (or any portion thereof) received by the redevelopment 
        authority during at least the first seven years after the date 
        of the initial transfer of property under subparagraph (A) 
        shall be used to support the economic redevelopment of, or 
        related to, the installation; and
            (ii) executes the agreement for transfer of the property 
        and accepts control of the property within a reasonable time 
        after the date of the property disposal record of decision or 
        finding of no significant impact under the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
    (C) For purposes of subparagraph (B)(i), the use of proceeds from a 
sale or lease described in such subparagraph to pay for, or offset the 
costs of, public investment on or related to the installation for any 
of the following purposes shall be considered a use to support the 
economic redevelopment of, or related to, the installation:
            (i) Road construction.
            (ii) Transportation management facilities.
            (iii) Storm and sanitary sewer construction.

        demolition.
            (xi) Landscaping, grading, and other site or public 
        improvements.
            (xii) Planning for or the marketing of the development and 
        reuse of the installation.
    (D) The Secretary may recoup from a redevelopment authority such 
portion of the proceeds from a sale or lease described in subparagraph 
(B) as the Secretary determines appropriate if the redevelopment 
authority does not use the proceeds to support economic redevelopment 
of, or related to, the installation for the period specified in 
subparagraph (B).
    (E)(i) The Secretary may transfer real property at an installation 
approved for closure or realignment under this title (including 
property at an installation approved for realignment which will be 
retained by the Department of Defense or another Federal agency after 
realignment) to the redevelopment authority for the installation if the 
redevelopment authority agrees to lease, directly upon transfer, one or 
more portions of the property transferred under this subparagraph to 
the Secretary or to the head of another department or agency of the 
Federal Government. Subparagraph (B) shall apply to a transfer under 
this subparagraph.
    (ii) A lease under clause (i) shall be for a term of not to exceed 
50 years, but may provide for options for renewal or extension of the 
term by the department or agency concerned.
    (iii) A lease under clause (i) may not require rental payments by 
the United States.
    (iv) A lease under clause (i) shall include a provision specifying 
that if the department or agency concerned ceases requiring the use of 
the leased property before the expiration of the term of the lease, the 
remainder of the lease term may be satisfied by the same or another 
department or agency of the Federal Government using the property for a 
use similar to the use under the lease. Exercise of the authority 
provided by this clause shall be made in consultation with the 
redevelopment authority concerned.
    (v) Notwithstanding clause (iii), if a lease under clause (i) 
involves a substantial portion of the installation, the department or 
agency concerned may obtain facility services for the leased property 
and common area maintenance from the redevelopment authority or the 
redevelopment authority's assignee as a provision of the lease. The 
facility services and common area maintenance shall be provided at a 
rate no higher than the rate charged to non-Federal tenants of the 
transferred property. Facility services and common area maintenance 
covered by the lease shall not include--
            (I) municipal services that a State or local government is 
        required by law to provide to all landowners in its 
        jurisdiction without direct charge; or
            (II) firefighting or security-guard functions.
    (F) The transfer of personal property under subparagraph (A) shall 
not be subject to the provisions of subchapters II and III of chapter 5 
of title 40, United States Code, if the Secretary determines that the 
transfer of such property is necessary for the effective implementation 
of a redevelopment plan with respect to the installation at which such 
property is located.
    (G) The provisions of section 120(h) of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 
U.S.C. 9620(h)) shall apply to any transfer of real property under this 
paragraph.
    (H) The Secretary may require any additional terms and conditions 
in connection with a transfer under this paragraph as such Secretary 
considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United States.
    (5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), the 
Secretary shall take such actions as the Secretary determines necessary 
to ensure that final determinations under paragraph (1) regarding 
whether another department or agency of the Federal Government has 
identified a use for any portion of a military installation to be 
closed or realigned under this title, or will accept transfer of any 
portion of such installation, are made not later than 6 months after 
the date of approval of closure or realignment of that installation.
    (B) The Secretary may, in consultation with the redevelopment 
authority with respect to an installation, postpone making the final 
determinations referred to in subparagraph (A) with respect to the 
installation for such period as the Secretary determines appropriate if 
the Secretary determines that such postponement is in the best 
interests of the communities affected by the closure or realignment of 
the installation.
    (C)(i) Before acquiring non-Federal real property as the location 
for a new or replacement Federal facility of any type, the head of the 
Federal agency acquiring the property shall consult with the Secretary 
regarding the feasibility and cost advantages of using Federal property 
or facilities at a military installation closed or realigned or to be 
closed or realigned under this title as the location for the new or 
replacement facility. In considering the availability and suitability 
of a specific military installation, the Secretary and the head of the 
Federal agency involved shall obtain the concurrence of the 
redevelopment authority with respect to the installation and comply 
with the redevelopment plan for the installation.
    (ii) Not later than 30 days after acquiring non-Federal real 
property as the location for a new or replacement Federal facility, the 
head of the Federal agency acquiring the property shall submit to 
Congress a report containing the results of the consultation under 
clause (i) and the reasons why military installations referred to in 
such clause that are located within the area to be served by the new or 
replacement Federal facility or within a 200-mile radius of the new or 
replacement facility, whichever area is greater, were considered to be 
unsuitable or unavailable for the site of the new or replacement 
facility.
    (6)(A) The disposal of buildings and property located at 
installations approved for closure or realignment under this title 
shall be carried out in accordance with this paragraph.
    (B)(i) Not later than the date on which the Secretary of Defense

        for which the Department of Defense has a use, for which 
        another department or agency of the Federal Government has 
        identified a use, or of which another department or agency will 
        accept a transfer;
            (II) take such actions as are necessary to identify any 
        building or property at the installation not identified under 
        subclause (I) that is excess property or surplus property;
            (III) submit to the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
        Development and to the redevelopment authority for the 
        installation (or the chief executive officer of the State in 
        which the installation is located if there is no redevelopment 
        authority for the installation at the completion of the 
        determination described in the stem of this sentence) 
        information on any building or property that is identified 
        under subclause (II); and
            (IV) publish in the Federal Register and in a newspaper of

the buildings or property, or any portion thereof, at the installation 
that are identified under subparagraph (B)(i)(II). A notice of interest 
under this clause shall describe the need of the government, 
representative, or party concerned for the buildings or property 
covered by the notice.
    (ii) The redevelopment authority for an installation shall assist 
the governments, representatives, and parties referred to in clause (i)

the closure or realignment of an installation, the Secretary of Defense 
shall treat the redevelopment plan submitted by the redevelopment 
authority for the installation (including the aspects of the plan 
providing for disposal to State or local governments, representatives 
of the homeless, and other interested parties) as part of the proposed 
Federal action for the installation. The Secretary of Defense shall 
incorporate the notification of the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development under clause (iii)(I) as part of the proposed Federal 
action for the installation only to the extent, if any, that the 
Secretary of Defense considers such incorporation to be appropriate and 
consistent with the best and highest use of the installation as a 
whole, taking into consideration the redevelopment plan submitted by 
the redevelopment authority.
    (III) The Secretary of Defense shall dispose of buildings and 
property under subclause (I) in accordance with the record of decision 
or other decision document prepared by the Secretary in accordance with 
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). 
In preparing the record of decision or other decision document, the 
Secretary shall give deference to the redevelopment plan submitted by 
the redevelopment authority for the installation.
    (IV) The disposal under subclause (I) of buildings and property to 
assist the homeless shall be without consideration.

of buildings and property for public benefit under section 550 of title 
40, United States Code, or sections 47151 through 47153 of title 49, 
United States Code, the sponsoring Federal agency shall use the 
eligibility criteria set forth in such section or subchapter II of 
chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code (as the case may be) to 
determine the eligibility of the applicant and use proposed in the 
request for the public benefit conveyance. The determination of such 
eligibility should be made before submission of the redevelopment plan 
concerned under subparagraph (G).
    (M)(i) In the event of the disposal of buildings and property of an 
installation pursuant to subparagraph (K) or (L), the redevelopment 
authority for the installation shall be responsible for the 
implementation of and compliance with agreements under the 
redevelopment plan described in that subparagraph for the installation.
    (ii) If a building or property reverts to a redevelopment authority 
under such an agreement, the redevelopment authority shall take 
appropriate actions to secure, to the maximum extent practicable, the 
utilization of the building or property by other homeless 
representatives to assist the homeless. A redevelopment authority may 
not be required to utilize the building or property to assist the 
homeless.
    (N) The Secretary of Defense may postpone or extend any deadline 
provided for under this paragraph in the case of an installation 
covered by this paragraph for such period as the Secretary considers 
appropriate if the Secretary determines that such postponement is in 
the interests of the communities affected by the closure or realignment 
of the installation. The Secretary shall make such determinations in 
consultation with the redevelopment authority concerned and, in the 
case of deadlines provided for under this paragraph with respect to the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
    (O) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``communities in the 
vicinity of the installation'', in the case of an installation, means 
the communities that constitute the political jurisdictions (other than 
the State in which the installation is located) that comprise the 
redevelopment authority for the installation.
    (P) For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``other interested 
parties'', in the case of an installation, includes any parties 
eligible for the conveyance of property of the installation under 
section 550 of title 40, United States Code, or sections 47151 through 
47153 of title 49, United States Code, whether or not the parties 
assist the homeless.
    (7)(A) Subject to subparagraph (C), the Secretary may enter into 
agreements (including contracts, cooperative agreements, or other 
arrangements for reimbursement) with local governments for the 
provision of police or security services, fire protection services, 
airfield operation services, or other community services by such 
governments at military installations to be closed under this title, or 
at facilities not yet transferred or otherwise disposed of in the case 
of installations closed under this title, if the Secretary determines 
that the provision of such services under such agreements is in the 
best interests of the Department of Defense.

paragraph without regard to the provisions of chapter 146 of title 10, 
United States Code.
    (C) The Secretary may not exercise the authority under subparagraph 
(A) with respect to an installation earlier than 180 days before the

into with a local government under this paragraph a clause that 
requires the use of professionals to furnish the services to the extent 
that professionals are available in the area under the jurisdiction of 
such government.
    (c) Applicability of National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.--
(1) The provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) shall not apply to the actions of the President, 
the Commission, and, except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
Department of Defense in carrying out this title.
    (2)(A) The provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 shall apply to actions of the Department of Defense under this 
title (i) during the process of property disposal, and (ii) during the

receiving installation has been selected but before the functions are 
relocated.
    (B) In applying the provisions of the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 to the processes referred to in subparagraph (A), the 
Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the military departments 
concerned shall not have to consider--
            (i) the need for closing or realigning the military 
        installation which has been recommended for closure or 
        realignment by the Commission;
            (ii) the need for transferring functions to any military 
        installation which has been selected as the receiving 
        installation; or
            (iii) military installations alternative to those 
        recommended or selected.
    (3) A civil action for judicial review, with respect to any 
requirement of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to the 
extent such Act is applicable under paragraph (2), of any act or

    (d) Waiver.--The Secretary of Defense may close or realign military 
installations under this title without regard to--
            (1) any provision of law restricting the use of funds for 
        closing or realigning military installations included in any 
        appropriations or authorization Act; and
            (2) sections 2662 and 2687 of title 10, United States Code.

Remediation Costs.--(1)(A) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection 
and section 120(h) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)), the 
Secretary may enter into an agreement to transfer by deed real property 
or facilities referred to in subparagraph (B) with any person who 
agrees to perform all environmental restoration, waste management, and 
environmental compliance activities that are required for the property 
or facilities under Federal and State laws, administrative decisions,

    (B) The real property and facilities referred to in subparagraph 
(A) are the real property and facilities located at an installation 
closed or to be closed, or realigned or to be realigned, under this 
title that are available exclusively for the use, or expression of an 
interest in a use, of a redevelopment authority under subsection 
(b)(6)(F) during the period provided for that use, or expression of 
interest in use, under that subsection. The real property and 
facilities referred to in subparagraph (A) are also the real property

in connection with an agreement authorized by subparagraph (A) as the 
Secretary considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United 
States.
    (2) A transfer of real property or facilities may be made under 
paragraph (1) only if the Secretary certifies to Congress that--
            (A) the costs of all environmental restoration, waste 
        management, and environmental compliance activities otherwise 
        to be paid by the Secretary with respect to the property or 
        facilities are equal to or greater than the fair market value 
        of the property or facilities to be transferred, as determined 
        by the Secretary; or
            (B) if such costs are lower than the fair market value of 
        the property or facilities, the recipient of the property or 
        facilities agrees to pay the difference between the fair market 
        value and such costs.
    (3) In the case of property or facilities covered by a 
certification under paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary may pay the 
recipient of such property or facilities an amount equal to the lesser 
of--
            (A) the amount by which the costs incurred by the recipient 
        of such property or facilities for all environmental 
        restoration, waste, management, and environmental compliance 
        activities with respect to such property or facilities exceed 
        the fair market value of such property or facilities as 
        specified in such certification; or
            (B) the amount by which the costs (as determined by the 
        Secretary) that would otherwise have been incurred by the 
        Secretary for such restoration, management, and activities with 
        respect to such property or facilities exceed the fair market 
        value of such property or facilities as so specified.
    (4) As part of an agreement under paragraph (1), the Secretary 
shall disclose to the person to whom the property or facilities will be 
transferred any information of the Secretary regarding the 
environmental restoration, waste management, and environmental 
compliance activities described in paragraph (1) that relate to the 
property or facilities. The Secretary shall provide such information 
before entering into the agreement.
    (5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to modify, alter, 
or amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) or the Solid Waste 
Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).
    (6) Section 330 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-484; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) shall not 
apply to any transfer under this subsection to persons or entities 
described in subsection (a)(2) of such section 330, except in the case
