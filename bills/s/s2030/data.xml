  <summary>2/12/2014--Introduced.
National Sea Grant College Program Amendments Act of 2014 - Reauthorizes the National Sea Grant College Program Act with specified appropriations through FY2020.

Removes a requirement that the Secretary of Commerce report annually to Congress regarding efforts and progress made by colleges, universities, institutions, associations, and alliances to become designated as sea grant colleges or institutes.

Requires (currently, allows) the Secretary to award marine policy fellowships to support the placement of individuals at the graduate level of education (in fields related to ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes resources) in positions with the executive and legislative branches of the federal government.

Repeals a requirement under the National Sea Grant College Program Act Amendments of 2002 that the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) submit an annual report to Congress regarding the coordination of research activities by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NSF.

Requires the National Sea Grant Advisory Board to report to Congress every three years (currently, every two years) on the progress made toward meeting priorities under the Secretary's strategic plan.

Authorizes additional FY2015-FY2020 appropriations designated specifically for competitive grants relating to: (1) university research on aquatic non-native species, oyster diseases, algal blooms, and specified regional or national priority issues; and (2) fishery extension activities conducted by sea grant colleges or institutes to enhance existing core program funding.

Requires the Director of the Program to use authority available for the temporary assignment of personnel between federal, state, and local governments and other organizations to meet any critical staffing requirement while implementing authorized activities. Exempts costs associated with the exercise of such authority from limitations on the amount that may be used for administration of programs in a fiscal year.</summary>
