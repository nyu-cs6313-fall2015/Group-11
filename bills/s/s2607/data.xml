  <summary>7/15/2014--Introduced.
Assisted Living Pilot Program for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Extension Act - Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 to extend the pilot program to assess the effectiveness of providing assistance to eligible veterans with traumatic brain injury to enhance their rehabilitation, quality of life, and community integration.

Requires that at least one location of the program be in each health care region of the Veterans Health Administration that contains a polytrauma center of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Under current law, selected locations also must include any location other than one described above in an area that contains a high concentration of veterans with traumatic brain injuries.)

Expands requirements for reports on the pilot program.

Replaces references to "assisted living" with the term "community-based brain injury residential rehabilitative care," including rehabilitation services within the meaning of such care.

Requires a veteran, in order to be eligible for such services, to have a traumatic brain injury that is classified as complex-mild to severe.</summary>
