                                 A BILL


 
 To extend and modify the pilot program of the Department of Veterans 
 Affairs on assisted living services for veterans with traumatic brain 
                    injury, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Assisted Living Pilot Program for 
Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury Extension Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in a 
        generation of veterans with traumatic brain injuries.
            (2) Since 2001, more than 265,000 members of the Armed 
        Forces have suffered traumatic brain injuries.
            (3) Since 2001, more than 26,000 members of the Armed 
        Forces have suffered moderate or severe head wounds.
            (4) Advances in medicine have kept members of the Armed 
        Forces alive who have suffered head wounds that might have 
        killed them in previous conflicts.
            (5) The pilot program of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        to assess the effectiveness of providing assisted living 
        services to eligible veterans to enhance the rehabilitation, 
        quality of life, and community integration of such veterans 
        required by section 1705(a) of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; 38 
        U.S.C. 1710C note) has provided to veterans who have moderate 
        to severe traumatic brain injuries, often coupled with other 
        significant physical and psychological challenges, a level of 
        comprehensive, coordinated care in residential facilities 
        across the United States since 2008.
            (6) The model of care practiced under the pilot program 
        specified in paragraph (5) has yielded impressive results and 
        helped rehabilitate dozens of veterans from severe injuries 
        that are notoriously difficult to treat.
            (7) The Department of Veterans Affairs does not offer to 
        veterans any alternatives to the pilot program specified in 
        paragraph (5) that replicate--
                    (A) the comprehensiveness of the rehabilitative 
                care provided under such program;
                    (B) the benefit of providing care under such 
                program in a residential setting; and
                    (C) the significant positive impact on veterans of 
                the sustained, longer-term care provided under such 
                program.
