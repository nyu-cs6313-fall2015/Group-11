                                 A BILL


 
To establish the Office of Planning for Future Intercity Transportation 
         within the Office of the Secretary of Transportation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Office of Planning for Future 
Intercity Transportation Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) High-speed passenger rail technology, while not new in 
        Europe and Asia, is a new transportation technology in the 
        United States. Its design, development, construction, 
        financing, funding, and operation require specific skills and 
        expertise that are not abundant in the United States, and will 
        require years to develop.
            (2) Unlike highways, mass transit, and aviation, high-speed 
        rail requires unique and separated rights of way to operate and 
        must be fully integrated with other passenger transportation 
        system elements to be successful.
            (3) In order to ensure the proper development of high-speed 
        intercity passenger rail service in the United States, it is 
        critical that a dedicated office be established at the highest 
        levels of the Federal Government to coordinate and facilitate 
        the intricate relationships between--
                    (A) various levels of government; and
                    (B) the wide range of industrial interests that 
                will be required to work together to make high-speed 
                rail successful.
            (4) Resources for transportation infrastructure are in high 
        demand. Many people contend that there are not enough resources 
        to maintain the transportation system the Nation has built, let 
        alone to build new modes of transportation such as high-speed 
        intercity passenger rail.
            (5) The capacity of the current transportation system 
        threatens the present and future competitiveness of the United 
        States. Unless investments are made in new, faster, and more 
        efficient transportation capacity, such as intercity high-speed 
        passenger rail, it will be very difficult for the United 
        States--
                    (A) to rise out of its current economic condition; 
                or
                    (B) to regain its leadership role domestically and 
                internationally.
            (6) Placing the development of a national system of 
        intercity high-speed rail corridors that are highly integrated 
        with other modes of transportation under the direct supervision 
        of the Secretary of Transportation and delegating the day-to-
        day administration of such system to an Assistant Secretary 
        will ensure an effective launch and the efficient operation of 
        a new national transportation modality.
            (7) It is in the interest of the United States to 
        expeditiously develop and deploy intercity high-speed passenger 
        rail under the singularly focused direction of the Secretary of 
        Transportation.
