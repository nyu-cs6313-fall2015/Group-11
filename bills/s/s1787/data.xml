Requires a minimum medical loss ratio of at least 85% for Medicaid and CHIP managed care plans under contracts between a state and a managed medical care entity (health maintenance organization), but a minimum ratio of only 80% for an entity in which at least 10% of the enrollees are optional targeted low-income children.
