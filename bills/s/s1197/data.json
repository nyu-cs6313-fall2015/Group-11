    "text": "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 - Division A: Department of Defense Authorizations - Title I: Procurement - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - (Sec. 101) Authorizes appropriations for FY2014 for the Department of Defense (DOD) for procurement for the Army, Navy and Marine Corps, Air Force, and defense-wide activities in amounts specified in the funding table in Division D of this Act.\n\nSubtitle C [sic]: Navy Programs - (Sec. 121) Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy, beginning with the FY2014 program year, to enter into a multiyear contract for the procurement of E-2D aircraft.\n\n(Sec. 122) Amends the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (Warner Act) to increase the cost limitation baseline for the lead ship in the CVN-21 class aircraft carrier program.

Requires such Secretary to maintain sufficient numbers of the EP-3 aircraft and associated personnel to sustain five such aircraft for allocation to the commanders of combatant commands under the global force management allocation plan. Directs such Secretary to: (1) extend the spiral 3 configuration upgrade to include a 12th aircraft, and (2) correct electronic intelligence system obsolescence deficiencies in both the EP-3 and P909 aircraft. Requires the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council to coordinate with the commanders of the combatant commands to determine requirements for the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities and capacity to be provided to the P909 aircraft. Directs such Secretary to maintain sufficient numbers of such aircraft to satisfy such requirements. Terminates such requirements relating to the EP-3 aircraft when the multi-intelligence broad area maritime system TRITON aircraft with signals intelligence capabilities equal or greater than the EP-3 aircraft reaches initial operational capability.\n\n(Sec. 125) Directs the Chief of Naval Operations to report to the defense and appropriations committees on the current concept of operations and expected survivability attributes of each of the littoral combat ship sea frames.\n\nSubtitle D: Air Force Programs - (Sec. 131) Requires the Secretary of the Air Force to consider, as part of the recapitalization of the Air Force tactical airlift fleet, upgrades to legacy C-130H aircraft designed to help meet Air Force fuel efficiency goals and the retention of such aircraft in the tactical airlift fleet.\n\n(Sec. 132) Amends the Warner Act to remove the requirement that: (1) any retired B-52 aircraft have a common capability configuration, and (2) the Secretary of the Air Force maintain at least 74 of the KC-135E aircraft retired after September 30, 2006, in a condition that would allow their recall for reserve, National Guard, or aerial refueling purposes.\n\n(Sec. 134) Prohibits the Secretary of the Air Force from obligating or expending any funds for procurement of C-27J aircraft not under contract as of June 1, 2013.\n\nSubtitle E: Joint and Multiservice Matters - (Sec. 151) Authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force, beginning with the FY2014 program year, to enter into a multiyear contract for the procurement of C-130J aircraft for the Air Force and the Navy.\n\n(Sec. 152) Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) armed, cargo, and utility helicopters are instrumental to DOD's ability to execute the National Security Strategy; (2) DOD should consider the health and viability of the military helicopter industrial base when building its annual research, development, and acquisition budget request; and (3) DOD and Congress should endeavor to maintain budget and program predictability in order to attract and retain a skilled workforce to ensure the technological capabilities required to sustain the preeminence of the U.S. military helicopter fleets.\n\nTitle II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY2014 for DOD for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E) in amounts specified in the funding table.\n\nSubtitle B: Program Requirements, Restrictions, and Limitations - (Sec. 211) Prohibits any FY2014 RDT&E funds for the conventional prompt global strike program from being obligated or expended until 60 days after the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy reports to the defense and appropriations committees addressing policy considerations concerning ambiguity problems regarding the launch of conventional prompt global strike missiles from submarine platforms.\n\n(Sec. 212) Revises, generally, elements of the biennial strategic plan of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Requires such Secretary, upon electing not to procure Blue Devil 1 aircraft systems under such systems, to submit to the defense, appropriations, and intelligence committees a plan to replace the capacity provided by such aircraft systems with a comparable or improved capability. Outlines requirements with respect to achievements of replacement capability.\n\nSubtitle C: Missile Defense Programs - (Sec. 231) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is a national priority to defend the U.S. homeland against the threat of a limited ballistic missile attack; (2) the currently-deployed ground-based midcourse defense system (GBMDS) provides protection for the entire United States against such an attack from North Korea and Iran, although its capability should be improved; (3) it is essential that the GBMDS achieve appropriate levels of reliability, availability, sustainability, and operational performance; (4) the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) should correct problems encountered during the December 2010 flight test of the GBMDS; (5) DOD should continue to enhance the performance and reliability of the GBMDS against the evolving missile threats from North Korea and Iran; (6) the MDA should continue GBMDS testing; (7) DOD has taken a number of steps to hedge against possible future growth in the ballistic threat to the U.S. homeland from such countries; and (8) DOD should continue to evaluate such threat and consider possibilities for prudent, affordable, and cost-effective steps to improve U.S. posture against future growth in such threats. Directs the Secretary to report to the defense and appropriations committees on potential future options for enhancing U.S. homeland ballistic missile defense.\n\n(Sec. 232) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the threat from regional ballistic missiles, particularly from North Korea and Iran, is serious and growing and puts at risk forward-deployed U.S. forces as well as U.S. allies and partners; (2) DOD and the United States have an obligation to protect such forces and allies; (3) the European phased adaptive approach to missile defense is an appropriate and prudent response to such threat; and (4) DOD should continue to develop, test, and plan to deploy phases 2 and 3 of such approach and should continue with other phased and adaptive regional missile defense efforts. Directs the Secretary to report to the defense and appropriations committees on the status and progress of regional missile defense programs and efforts.\n\n(Sec. 233) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) it is in the U.S. national security interest to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with Russia, (2) the United States should pursue such efforts on a bilateral and multilateral basis with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies, (3) such cooperation should not in any way limit U.S. or NATO missile defense capabilities, (4) the United States should pursue such cooperation in a manner that safeguards classified information and allows for a defense technology cooperation agreement with Russia, and (5) the sovereignty of the United States and its ability to pursue its own missile defense program should be protected. Prohibits FY2014 DOD funds from being used to provide the Russian Federation with sensitive missile defense information that would compromise U.S. national security in any way, including the \"hit-to-kill\" technology and telemetry data for missile defense interceptors or target vehicles.\n\n(Sec. 234) Directs the MDA to deploy an X-band radar or other comparable sensor at a location optimized to support U.S. defense against long-range ballistic missile threats.
