                        Department of Transportation and the NTIA, 
                        develop and publish a test plan, including a 
                        timeline, for the use of unlicensed devices in 
                        the 5850-5925 MHz band.
                            (ii) Requirement.--The test plan developed 
                        and published under clause (i) shall be 
                        designed to allow the Commission to evaluate

                                that could be performed by unlicensed 
                                or shared spectrum;
                                    (IV) whether a system of priority 
                                access could substitute for exclusive 
                                licensing and, if so, whether the 
                                system of priority access should be 
                                confined to--
                                            (aa) particular portions of 
                                        the 5850-5925 MHz band; and

                                        dedicated short-range 
                                        communications crash avoidance;
                                    (V) whether non-exclusive licensing 
                                or other forms of shared spectrum 
                                access could substitute for exclusive 
                                licensing;
                                    (VI) whether the Commission could 
                                promulgate rules to migrate existing 
                                licensees to an alternative band;
                                    (VII) whether, to protect critical 
                                public safety communications, the 
                                Commission could allow sharing in only 
                                a portion of the 5850-5925 MHz 
                                spectrum; and
                                    (VIII) whether shared use or a 
                                system of priority access--
                                            (aa) causes harmful 
                                        interference to incumbent 
                                        licensees; or
                                            (bb) compromises safety-of-
                                        life uses by incumbent 
                                        licensees that are necessary 
                                        for advancing motor vehicle 
                                        safety.
                    (C) Testing; results.--Not later than 15 months 
                after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
                Commission, in consultation with the Department of 
                Transportation and the NTIA, shall--
                            (i) conduct testing in accordance with the 
                        test plan developed under subparagraph (B);
                            (ii) publish a summary of the results of 
                        the testing to the docket relating to the 5850-
                        5925 MHz band; and
                            (iii) reference the results of the testing 
                        and the comments filed under subparagraph (A) 
                        in determining unlicensed device use of the 
                        5850-5925 MHz band.
                    (D) Regulations.--
                            (i) In general.--Not later than 18 months 
                        after the date of enactment of this Act--
                                    (I) if the Commission determines 
                                that a mitigation technology, 
                                rechannelization, or other approach 
                                would allow unlicensed operations in 
                                the 5850-5925 MHz band that will not 
                                cause harmful interference to existing 
                                licensees of that band, the Commission 
                                shall modify part 15 of title 47, Code 
                                of Federal Regulations, to adopt 
                                technical rules suitable for the 
                                widespread commercial deployment of 
                                unlicensed operations for the 5850-5925 
                                MHz band; or
                                    (II) if the Commission determines 
                                that no mitigation technology, 
                                rechannelization, or other sharing 
                                approach would prevent unlicensed 
                                operations in the 5850-5925 MHz band 
                                from causing harmful interference to 
                                existing licensees of that band, the 
                                Commission--
                                            (aa) shall provide 
                                        notification of the 
                                        determination to--

                                                    (BB) the Department 
                                                of Transportation; and

                                                    (CC) the NTIA; and

                                            (bb) may not modify part 15 
                                        of title 47, Code of Federal 
                                        Regulations, to adopt technical 
                                        rules suitable for the 
                                        widespread commercial 
                                        deployment of unlicensed 
                                        operations for the 5850-5925 
                                        MHz band until the Commission 
                                        can ensure that such operations 
                                        will not cause harmful 
                                        interference to existing 
                                        licensees of that band.
                            (ii) Intelligent transportation systems.--
                        The Commission shall modify subpart M of part 
                        90 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations 
                        (relating to the Intelligent Transportation 
                        Systems radio service), and subpart L of part 
                        95 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations 
                        (relating to dedicated short-range 
                        communications service on-board units), if the 
                        Commission determines that such a modification 
                        would maximize the utility of the 5850-5925 MHz 
                        band while protecting existing licensees from 
                        harmful interference.

SEC. 3. ASSESSING UNLICENSED SPECTRUM AND WI-FI USE IN LOW-INCOME 
              NEIGHBORHOODS.

    (a) Study.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission shall conduct a study to 
        evaluate the availability of broadband Internet access using 
        unlicensed spectrum and wireless networks in low income 
        neighborhoods.
            (2) Requirements.--In conducting the study under paragraph 
        (1), the Commission shall consider and evaluate--
                    (A) any barriers preventing or limiting the 
                deployment and use of wireless networks in low-income 
                neighborhoods;
                    (B) how to overcome the barriers described in 
                subparagraph (A) through incentives, policies, or 
                requirements that would increase the availability of 
                unlicensed spectrum and related technologies in low-
