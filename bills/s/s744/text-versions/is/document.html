SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The passage of this Act recognizes that the primary 
        tenets of its success depend on securing the sovereignty of the 
        United States of America and establishing a coherent and just 
        system for integrating those who seek to join American society.
            (2) We have a right, and duty, to maintain and secure our 
        borders, and to keep our country safe and prosperous. As a 
        nation founded, built and sustained by immigrants we also have 
        a responsibility to harness the power of that tradition in a 
        balanced way that secures a more prosperous future for America.
            (3) We have always welcomed newcomers to the United States 
        and will continue to do so. But in order to qualify for the 
        honor and privilege of eventual citizenship, our laws must be 
        followed. The world depends on America to be strong -- 
        economically, militarily and ethically. The establishment of a 
        stable, just and efficient immigration system only supports 
        those goals. As a nation, we have the right and responsibility 
        to make our borders safe, to establish clear and just rules for 
        seeking citizenship, to control the flow of legal immigration, 
        and to eliminate illegal immigration, which in some cases has 
        become a threat to our national security.
            (4) All parts of this Act are premised on the right and 
        need of the United States to achieve these goals, and to 
        protect its borders and maintain its sovereignty.

                applicable administrative review procedures under 
                section 245E(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 
                as added by section 2104(a) of this Act, if the alien--
                            (i) no longer meets the eligibility 
                        requirements described in subsection (a)(1)(C);

                                return was due to extenuating 
                                circumstances beyond the alien's 
                                control.

                        requirement imposed by the Secretary under 
                        clause (i) shall be revoked unless the alien 
                        demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction 
                        that such failure was reasonably excusable.
                    (C) Invalidation of documentation.--If an alien's 
                blue card status is revoked under subparagraph (A), any

        Reconciliation Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1613).
            (4) Treatment of blue card status.--A noncitizen granted 
        blue card status shall be considered lawfully present in the

        status.--The Secretary may adjust the status of an alien who 
        has been granted blue card status to the status of a registered 
        provisional immigrant under section 245B if the Secretary

            (1) In general.--Each employer of an alien granted blue

                knowingly failed to provide the record of employment 
                required under paragraph (1) or has provided a false 
                statement of material fact in such a record, the 
                employer shall be subject to a civil penalty in an 
                amount not to exceed $500 per violation.
                    (B) Limitation.--The penalty under subparagraph (A) 
                for failure to provide employment records shall not 
                apply unless the alien has provided the employer with 
                evidence of employment authorization provided under 
                subsection (c).
                    (C) Deposit of civil penalties.--Civil penalties

SEC. 2212. ADJUSTMENT TO PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), and not 
earlier than 5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary shall adjust the status of an alien granted blue card status 
to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the 
Secretary determines that the following requirements are satisfied:
            (1) Qualifying employment.--Except as provided in paragraph 
        (3), the alien--
                    (A) during the 8-year period beginning on the date 
                of the enactment of this Act, performed not less than 
                100 work days of agricultural employment during each of 
                5 years; or
                    (B) during the 5-year period beginning on the date 
                of the enactment of this Act, performed not less than 
                150 work days of agricultural employment during each of 
                3 years.
            (2) Evidence.--An alien may demonstrate compliance with the 
        requirement under paragraph (1) by submitting--
                    (A) the record of employment described in section 
                2211(e);
                    (B) documentation that may be submitted under 
                subsection (e)(5); or
                    (C) any other documentation designated by the 
                Secretary for such purpose.
            (3) Extraordinary circumstances.--
                    (A) In general.--In determining whether an alien 
                has met the requirement under paragraph (1), the 
                Secretary may credit the alien with not more than 12 
                additional months of agricultural employment in the 
                United States to meet such requirement if the alien was 
                unable to work in agricultural employment due to--
                            (i) pregnancy, disabling injury, or disease 
                        that the alien can establish through medical 
                        records;
                            (ii) illness, disease, or other special 
                        needs of a child that the alien can establish 
                        through medical records;
                            (iii) severe weather conditions that 
                        prevented the alien from engaging in 
                        agricultural employment for a significant 
                        period of time; or
                            (iv) termination from agricultural 
                        employment, if the Secretary determines that--
                                    (I) the termination was without 
                                just cause; and
                                    (II) the alien was unable to find 
                                alternative agricultural employment

                imposed under subparagraph (A) shall be imposed

                    (C) Waiver.--The requirements of subparagraph (A)

SEC. 3717. PROCEDURES FOR BOND HEARINGS AND FILING OF NOTICES TO 
              APPEAR.

    (a) Aliens in Custody.--Section 236 (8 U.S.C. 1226) is amended by 
adding at the end the following:
    ``(f) Procedures for Custody Hearings.--For any alien taken into 
custody under any provision of this Act, with the exception of minors 
being transferred to or in the custody of the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement, the following shall apply:
            ``(1) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, without 
        unnecessary delay and not later than 72 hours after the alien 
        is taken into custody, file the Notice to Appear or other 
        relevant charging document with the immigration court having 
        jurisdiction over the location where the alien was apprehended, 
        and serve such notice on the alien.
            ``(2) The Secretary shall immediately determine whether the 
        alien shall remain in custody or be released and, without 
        unnecessary delay and not later than 72 hours after the alien 
        was taken into custody, serve upon the alien the custody 
        decision specifying the reasons for continued custody and the 
        amount of bond if any.
            ``(3) The Attorney General shall ensure the alien has the 
        opportunity to appear before an immigration judge for a custody 
        determination hearing promptly after service of the Secretary's 
        custody decision. The immigration judge may, on the Secretary's 
        motion and upon a showing of good cause, postpone a custody 
        determination hearing for no more than 72 hours after service 
        of the custody decision, except that in no case shall the 
        hearing occur more than seven days (including weekends and 
        holidays) after the alien was taken into custody.
            ``(4) The immigration judge shall advise the alien of the 
        right to postpone the custody determination hearing and shall, 
        on the oral or written request of the individual, postpone the 
        custody determination hearing for a period of no more than 14 
        days.
            ``(5) Except for aliens that the immigration judge has 
        determined are deportable as described in section 236A and 
        236(c), the immigration judge shall review the custody 
        determination de novo and may detain the alien only if the 
        Secretary demonstrates that no conditions, including the use of 
        alternatives to detention that maintain custody over the alien, 
        will reasonably assure the appearance of the alien as required 
        and the safety of any other person and the community. For 
        aliens detained under 236(c), the immigration judge may review 
        the custody determination if the Secretary agrees the alien is 
        not a danger to the community and alternatives to detention 
        exist that assure the appearance of the alien as required and 
        the safety of any other person and the community.
            ``(6) In the case of any alien remaining in custody after a 
        custody determination, the Attorney General shall provide de 
        novo custody determination hearings before an immigration judge 
        every 90 days so long as the alien remains in custody. The 
        alien may obtain a de novo custody redetermination hearing upon 
        a showing of good cause.
            ``(7) The Secretary shall inform the alien of his or her 
        rights under this paragraph at the time the alien is first 
        taken into custody.''.
    (b) Stipulated Removal.--Section 240(d) (8 U.S.C. 1229a) is amended 
to read as follows:
    ``(d) Stipulated Removal.--The Attorney General shall provide by 
regulation for the entry by an immigration judge of an order of removal 
stipulated to by the alien (or the alien's representative) and the 
Service. An immigration judge may enter a stipulated removal order only 
upon a finding at an in-person hearing that the stipulation is 
voluntary, knowing and intelligent. A stipulated order shall constitute 
a conclusive determination of the alien's removability from the United 
States.''.

SEC. 3718. SANCTIONS FOR COUNTRIES THAT DELAY OR PREVENT REPATRIATION 
              OF THEIR NATIONALS.

    Section 243(d) (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(d) Discontinuing Granting Visas to Nationals of Countries That 
Deny or Delay Accepting Aliens.--Notwithstanding section 221(c), if the 
Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, that the government of a foreign country denies or 
unreasonably delays accepting aliens who are citizens, subjects, 
nationals, or residents of that country after the Secretary asks 
whether the government will accept an alien under this section, or 
after a determination that the alien is inadmissible under paragraph 
(6) or (7) of section 212(a), the Secretary of State shall order 
consular officers in that foreign country to discontinue granting 
visas, or classes of visas until the Secretary of Homeland Security 
notifies the Secretary of State that the country has accepted the 
aliens.''.

following:
    ``(j) Premium Processing.--
            ``(1) Pilot processing service.--Recognizing that the best 
        solution for expedited processing is low interview wait times 
        for all applicants, the Secretary of State shall nevertheless 
        establish, on a limited, pilot basis only, a fee-based premium 
        processing service to expedite interview appointments. In 
        establishing a pilot processing service, the Secretary may--

                is authorized to collect, and set the amount of, a fee 
                imposed for the premium processing service. The 
                Secretary of State shall set the fee based on all 
                relevant considerations including, the cost of 
                expedited service.
                    ``(B) Use of fees.--Fees collected under the 
                authority of subparagraph (A) shall be deposited as an 
                offsetting collection to any Department of State 
                appropriation, to recover the costs of providing

                nonrefundable to the applicant.
            ``(3) Description of premium processing.--Premium 
        processing pertains solely to the expedited scheduling of a 
        visa interview. Utilizing the premium processing service for an 
        expedited interview appointment does not establish the 
        applicant's eligibility for a visa. The Secretary of State 
        shall, if possible, inform applicants utilizing the premium 
        processing of potential delays in visa issuance due to 
        additional screening requirements, including necessary 
        security-related checks and clearances.

countries in which circumstances indicate that such a review is

        missions--

                interview in an expeditious manner, consistent with 
                national security requirements, and in recognition of 
                resource allocation considerations, such as the need to 
                ensure provision of consular services to citizens of 
                the United States;
                    (B) to set a goal of interviewing 80 percent of all

                interview wait times under 15 work days on a 
                consistent, year-round basis, recognizing that demand 
                can spike suddenly and unpredictably and that the first 
                priority of United States missions abroad is the 
                protection of citizens of the United States; and
            (2) submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a 
        detailed strategic plan that describes the resources needed to

        Foreign Relations, and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
        Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
        House of Representatives.
    (c) Semi-Annual Report.--Not later than 30 days after the end of 
the first 6 months after the implementation of subsection (a), and not 
later than 30 days after the end of each subsequent quarter, the

Congress a report that provides--
            (1) data substantiating the efforts of the Secretary of 
        State to meet the requirements and goals described in 
        subsection (a);
            (2) any factors that have negatively impacted the efforts 
        of the Secretary to meet such requirements and goals; and
            (3) any measures that the Secretary plans to implement to 
        meet such requirements and goals.
    (d) Savings Provision.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in subsection (a) may be construed 
        to affect a consular officer's authority--
                    (A) to deny a visa application under section 221(g) 
                of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
                1201(g)); or
                    (B) to initiate any necessary or appropriate 
                security-related check or clearance.
            (2) Security checks.--The completion of a security-related 
        check or clearance shall not be subject to the time limits set 
        out in subsection (a).
