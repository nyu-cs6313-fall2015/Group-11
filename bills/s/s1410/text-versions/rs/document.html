a sentence for a covered offense, may, on motion of the defendant, the

effect at the time the covered offense was committed.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Limitations.--No court shall entertain a motion made 
under this section to reduce a sentence if the sentence was previously 
imposed or previously reduced in accordance with the amendments made by

220; 124 Stat. 2372) or if a motion made under this section to reduce

401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841) or section 1010 of

        Code, to formulate the sentencing guidelines in such a way as 
        to ``minimize the likelihood that the Federal prison population 
        will exceed the capacity of the Federal prisons'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the findings and conclusions of the United 
        States Sentencing Commission in its October 2011 report to 
        Congress entitled, Mandatory Minimum Penalties in the Federal 
        Criminal Justice System;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        made by the United States Sentencing Commission;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) the relevant public safety concerns involved 
        in the considerations before the United States Sentencing 
        Commission;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) the intent of Congress that penalties for 
        violent and serious drug traffickers who present public safety 
        risks remain appropriately severe; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) the need to reduce and prevent racial 
        disparities in Federal sentencing.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Emergency Authority.--The United States Sentencing 
Commission shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) promulgate the guidelines, policy statements, 
        or amendments provided for in this Act as soon as practicable, 
        and in any event not later than 120 days after the date of

        forth in section 21(a) of the Sentencing Act of 1987 (28 U.S.C. 
        994 note), as though the authority under that Act had not 
        expired; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) pursuant to the emergency authority provided 
        under paragraph (1), make such conforming amendments to the 
        Federal sentencing guidelines as the Commission determines

        provisions and applicable law.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Attorney General shall submit to the Committees on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report 
outlining how the reduced expenditures on Federal corrections and the 
cost savings resulting from this Act will be used to help reduce

investment in law enforcement and crime prevention, and help reduce 
criminal recidivism, thereby increasing the effectiveness of Federal 
criminal justice spending.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
