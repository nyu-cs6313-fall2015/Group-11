                            to Gender-Based Violence Globally.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) An estimated 1 out of every 3 women throughout the 
        world will be beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in 
        her lifetime.
            (2) Up to 70 percent of women in some countries report 
        having been victims of domestic violence at some stage in their 
        lives.
            (3) Sexual violence among adolescents and pre-adolescents 
        is alarmingly high. In 2010, the first nationally 
        representative survey of violence against children in Tanzania 
        found that nearly 3 in 10 females and 1 in 7 males experienced 
        sexual violence prior to the age of 18.
            (4) The International Men and Gender Equality Survey 
        dataset shows that adult male respondents in 6 countries who 
        had experienced violence as children were significantly more 
        likely to report perpetrating intimate partner violence 
        themselves than their peers who did not experience violence as 
        children.
            (5) Violence against women and girls impedes progress in 
        meeting many United States global development goals, including 
        efforts to stem maternal mortality and the spread of HIV/AIDS. 
        Approximately 1 in 4 women are abused during pregnancy which 
        has been linked to miscarriage, pre-term labor, low birth 
        weight, fetal distress, and death.
            (6) Country studies indicate that the risk of HIV among 
        women who have experienced violence may be up to 3 times higher 
        than among those who have not. Women who have experienced 
        violence are also at higher risk for contracting HIV, and women 
        living with HIV may be up to 3 times more likely to experience 
        violence than other women. Fear of violence also prevents women 
        from accessing HIV/AIDS information and receiving treatment and 
        counseling.
            (7) The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) 
        supports significant work in the field to mainstream gender-
        based violence into existing HIV programs. Addressing gender 
        norms and inequities is essential to reducing HIV risk and 
        increasing access to HIV prevention, care and treatment 
        services for women and men.
            (8) Increasing women's access to economic opportunities and 
        food security is crucial to preventing and responding to 
        domestic and sexual violence. Inclusive finance and micro-
        enterprise reduce levels of intimate partner violence and 
        provide economic independence for survivors.
            (9) Prevalence of sexual violence is higher among persons 
        with disabilities, particularly for adolescents and intimate 
        partners with disabilities, and for men and women with 
        intellectual impairments living in institutions.
            (10) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls in 
        humanitarian emergencies, conflict settings, and natural 
        disasters face extreme violence and threats, including--
                    (A) being forced to exchange sex for food and 
                humanitarian supplies; and
                    (B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual 
                exploitation, and abuse.
            (11) Rape and sexual assault against women and girls are 
        used to torture, intimidate, and terrorize women and their 
        communities.
            (12) Early and forced marriage of the girl child--
                    (A) is a violation of human rights as it denies 
                girls the right to decide when and with whom to marry;
                    (B) is a harmful practice that deprives girls of 
                their dignity, bringing childhood and adolescence to a 
                premature and unnatural end;
                    (C) can end girls' education and can result in 
                bonded labor or enslavement, commercial sexual 
                exploitation, and violence against the victims;
                    (D) significantly increases the risk of maternal 
                death and morbidity, infant mortality and morbidity, 
                obstetric fistula, and sexually transmitted diseases, 
                including HIV/AIDS; and
                    (E) is perpetuated by poverty, a lack of 
                educational or employment opportunities for girls, 
                parental concerns to ensure sexual relations within 
                marriage, the dowry system, and the perceived lack of 
                value of girls.
            (13) World Bank data shows that gender inequality directly 
        corresponds to increased levels of political and economic 
        instability within States.
            (14) Domestic violence is the most prevalent form of 
        violence against women and prevents women from playing more 
        active roles in the social, economic, and political development 
        of their communities. In humanitarian crises, this global 
        scourge becomes acute, preventing women from helping to rebuild 
        their countries.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to take effective action to prevent and respond to
