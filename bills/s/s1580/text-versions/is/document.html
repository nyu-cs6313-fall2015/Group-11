        Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall assess whether the building 
        where such housing or services are provided is and whether the

        2012(c)(1) of such title, as amended by subsection (a)(1).
            (2) Failure to comply.--In the case described in paragraph

        this Act, the Secretary may not make any additional per diem 
        payments to the recipient for the provision of such housing or 
        services under section 2012 of such title until the Secretary 
        certifies that such building is and such housing or services 
        are in compliance.
    (g) Conforming Condition on Award of Grants by Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs for Comprehensive Service Programs.--Section
