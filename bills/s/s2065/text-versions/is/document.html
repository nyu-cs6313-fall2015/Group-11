    (a) Maximum Fuel Economy Increase for Alternative Fuel 
Automobiles.--Section 32906(a) of title 49, United States Code, is 
amended by striking ``(except an electric automobile)'' and inserting 
``(except an electric automobile or, beginning with model year 2016, an 
alternative fueled automobile that does not use a fuel described in 
subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of section 32901(a)(1))''.
    (b) Minimum Driving Ranges for Dual Fueled Passenger Automobiles.--
Section 32901(c)(2) of title 49, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``, except that 
        beginning with model year 2016, alternative fueled automobiles 
        that do not use a fuel described in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), 
        or (D) of subsection (a)(1) shall have a minimum driving range 
        of 150 miles'' after ``at least 200 miles''; and
            (2) in subparagraph (C), by adding at the end the 
        following: ``Beginning with model year 2016, if the Secretary 
        prescribes a minimum driving range of 150 miles for alternative 
        fueled automobiles that do not use a fuel described in 
        subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of subsection (a)(1), 
        subparagraph (A) shall not apply to dual fueled automobiles 
        (except electric automobiles).''.

            (4) by adding at the end the following:

        fuel dual fueled automobile manufactured by a manufacturer 
        after model year 2015, the Administrator shall calculate fuel 
        economy as a weighted harmonic average of the fuel economy on 
        gaseous fuel as measured under subsection (c) and the fuel 
        economy on gasoline or diesel fuel as measured under section 
        32904(c). The Administrator shall apply the utility factors set 
        forth in the table under section 600.510-12(c)(2)(vii)(A) of

            ``(3) Model years after 2016.--Beginning with model year 
        2017, the manufacturer may elect to utilize the utility factors 
        set forth under subsection (e)(1) for the purposes of 
        calculating fuel economy under paragraph (2).''.
    (d) Electric Dual Fueled Automobiles.--Section 32905 of title 49, 
United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (e) and (f) as subsections

    ``(e) Electric Dual Fueled Automobiles.--
            ``(1) In general.--At the request of the manufacturer, the 
        Administrator may measure the fuel economy for any model of 
        dual fueled automobile manufactured after model year 2015 that 
        is capable of operating on electricity in addition to gasoline 
        or diesel fuel, obtains its electricity from a source external 
        to the vehicle, and meets the minimum driving range 
        requirements established by the Secretary for dual fueled 
        electric automobiles, by dividing 1.0 by the sum of--
                    ``(A) the percentage utilization of the model on 
                gasoline or diesel fuel, as determined by a formula 
                based on the model's alternative fuel range, divided by 
                the fuel economy measured under section 32904(c); and
                    ``(B) the percentage utilization of the model on 
                electricity, as determined by a formula based on the 
                model's alternative fuel range, divided by the fuel 
                economy measured under section 32904(a)(2).
            ``(2) Alternative utilization.--The Administrator may adapt 
        the utility factor established under paragraph (1) for

        calculate such incentive for such automobiles manufactured by 
        such manufacturer after model year 2015 in accordance with 
        subsection (b).''.
