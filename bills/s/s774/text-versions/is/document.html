SECTION 1. GAO REPORT ON UNIVERSAL SERVICE REFORMS.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of the report required under subsection 
(b) is to aid Congress in monitoring and measuring the effects of a 
series of reforms by the Federal Communications Commission (in this Act 
referred to as the ``FCC'') intended to promote the availability and 
affordability of broadband service throughout the United States.
    (b) Report.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
prepare a report providing detailed measurements, statistics, and 
metrics with respect to--
            (1) the progress of implementation of the reforms adopted 
        in the FCC's Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed 
        Rulemaking adopted on October 27, 2011 (FCC 11-161) (in this 
        Act referred to as the ``Order'');
            (2) the effects, if any, of such reforms on retail end user 
        rates during the applicable calendar year for--
                    (A) local voice telephony services (including any 
                subscriber line charges and access recovery charges 
                assessed by carriers upon purchasers of such services);
                    (B) interconnected VoIP services;
                    (C) long distance voice services;

                    (F) fixed broadband Internet access services; and
                    (G) mobile broadband Internet access services;
            (3) any disparities or trends detectable during the 
        applicable calendar year with respect to the relative average 
        (such as per-consumer) retail rates charged for each of the 
        services listed in paragraph (2) to consumers (including both 
        residential and business users) located in rural areas and 
        urban areas;
            (4) any disparities or trends detectable during the 
        applicable calendar year with respect to the relative average 
        (such as per-consumer) retail rates charged for each of the 
        services listed in paragraph (2) as between incumbent local 
        exchange carriers subject to price cap regulation and those 
        subject to rate-of-return regulation;
            (5) the effects, if any, of those reforms adopted in the 
        Order on average fixed and mobile broadband Internet access

        respectively, in rural areas and urban areas;
            (7) the effects, if any, of those reforms adopted in the

        Service under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 
        901 et seq.);
            (8) any disparities or trends detectable during the 
        applicable calendar year with respect to the relative magnitude 
        and pace of investments in broadband-capable networks in rural 
        areas and urban areas;
            (9) any disparities or trends detectable during the 
        applicable calendar year with respect to the magnitude and pace 
        of investments in broadband-capable networks in areas served by 
        carriers subject to price cap regulation and areas served by 
        carriers subject to rate-of-return regulation;
