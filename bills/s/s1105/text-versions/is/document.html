        Federal Reserve System shall, within existing programs, 
        continuously conduct outreach and education programs aimed at 
        helping each business using or accepting cash to choose the

        place orders with the Federal Reserve System, or through any 
        United States financial institution, for supplies of $1 
        monetary units, are fully briefed before placing each such

        circulation economies when used for transactions of a low 
        dollar value.
    (b) Publicity Requirement.--Section 5112(p)(2) of title 31, United

carry out this Act.
    (d) Clarification With Respect to Seigniorage.--The ninth proviso

SEC. 3. SAVING TAXPAYERS FUNDS BY TRANSITIONING TO THE USE OF $1 COINS.

    (a) In General.--It is the policy of the United States that after 
$1 coins achieve sufficient market penetration such that consumers and 
retailers are comfortable using $1 coins and are able to obtain 
adequate supplies of $1 coins, $1 coins should replace $1 Federal 
Reserve notes as the only $1 monetary unit issued and circulated by the 
Federal Reserve System.
    (b) Deadline for Placing $1 Federal Reserve Notes Into 
Circulation.--Federal Reserve banks may continue to place into 
circulation $1 Federal Reserve notes until the earlier of--
            (1) the date on which the number of $1 coins placed into 
        circulation after the date of the enactment of this Act exceeds 
        600,000,000 annually; or
            (2) the date that is 4 years after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act.
    (c) Transition Period.--After the date referred to in subsection 
(b), a Federal Reserve bank may not order additional $1 Federal Reserve 
notes but may, for a period of one year, continue to place into 
circulation $1 Federal Reserve notes on hand or those deposited with 
it, except for notes described in subsection (d).
    (d) Removal of Unfit Currency.--After the date referred to in 
subparagraph (b), a Federal Reserve bank shall continue to remove unfit 
currency from circulation, and shall continue to destroy such currency.
    (e) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c), the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall produce such Federal 
Reserve notes of $1 denomination as the Board of Governors determines 
from time to time are appropriate solely to meet the needs of 
collectors of that denomination. Such notes shall be issued by one or 
more Federal Reserve banks in accordance with section 16 of the Federal 
Reserve Act and sold by the Board of Governors, in whole or in part, 
under procedures prescribed by the Board of Governors.
    (f) No Effect on Legal Tender.--Notwithstanding any other 
subsection of this section, $1 Federal Reserve notes are legal tender 
in the United States for all debts, public and private, public charges, 
taxes, and duties, regardless of the date of printing or issue.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
