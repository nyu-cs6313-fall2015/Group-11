  <summary>6/10/2013--Passed Senate amended.
Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 - Title I: Commodity Programs - Subtitle A: Repeals and Reforms - (Sec. 1101) Amends the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 to repeal, but continue for crop year 2013: (1) direct payments, (2) countercyclical payments, and (3) the average crop revenue election program (ACRE).

(Sec. 1105) Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to provide for a farm's base acreage adjustment for covered commodities if: (1) a conservation reserve contract expires or is voluntarily terminated, (2) cropland is released from conservation reserve contract coverage, (3) the producer has eligible pulse crop acreage, or (4) the producer has eligible oilseed acreage.

(Sec. 1106) Directs the Secretary to establish a yield for each farm for any designated oilseed or eligible pulse crop for which a payment yield was not established under the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002.

(Sec. 1107) Directs the Secretary, for the 2014-2018 crop years for each covered commodity, to make adverse market payments to producers on farms for which payment yields and base acres are established for a covered commodity whose actual price is less than its reference price.

(Sec. 1108) Authorizes agriculture risk coverage (ARC) payments for covered commodities for the 2014-2018 crop years.

 Requires producers to make a one-time, binding election to receive either individual or county coverage for all covered commodities and all acres under the control of the producer.

Directs the Secretary to make ARC payments when a producer's actual crop revenue for a covered commodity is less than the agriculture risk coverage guarantee. Establishes the agriculture risk guarantee as 88% of the benchmark revenue.

Sets forth payment rate and payment amount provisions.

(Sec. 1109) Requires producers to comply with specified requirements, including conservation and wetland provisions, in order to qualify for ARC payments.

Terminates ARC payments upon a change in the interest of the producer unless the transferee assumes all ARC obligations.
