  <summary>6/26/2014--Introduced.
RESPONSE Act of 2014 - Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish the Railroad Emergency Services Preparedness, Operational Needs, and Safety Evaluation Subcommittee of the National Advisory Council.

Directs the Subcommittee to develop recommendations for improving emergency responder training and resource allocation, including regarding:

 the quality and application of training for local emergency first responders related to rail hazardous materials incidents, with a particular focus on local emergency responders and small communities near railroads; the effectiveness of funding levels related to training local emergency responders for rail hazardous materials incidents, with a particular focus on local emergency responders and small communities; a strategy for integration of commodity flow studies, mapping, and access platforms for local emergency responders and how to increase the rate of access to the individual responder in communications technology; the lack of emergency response plans for rail, similar to existing law related to maritime and stationary facility emergency response plans; the development of a train incident database; increasing access to relevant, useful, and timely information for the local emergency responder; and determining the most efficient agencies and offices for the implementation of the recommendations. Terminates the Subcommittee not later than four years after this Act's enactment, subject to one year extensions.</summary>
