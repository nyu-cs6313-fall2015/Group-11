shall hold a public information-gathering session to discuss the state

the Administrator shall accept, consider, and address public comments

comments on such questions and shall not accept a question that unduly 
narrows the scope of an advisory activity.

comments, including oral comments and discussion during the 
proceedings, that shall not be limited by an insufficient or arbitrary 
time restriction. Public comments shall be provided to the Board when

significant comments offered by members of the public to the Board.

amended by adding after subsection (h), as added by subsection (d) of 
this section, the following:

explicitly distinguish between scientific determinations and policy 
advice.

with the scientific advice provided to the Administrator.

affecting the Environmental Protection Agency.''.
