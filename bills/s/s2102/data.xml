  <summary>3/10/2014--Introduced.
Amends the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act with respect to establishment of minimum leverage and minimum risk-based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for a depository institution holding company or a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

Declares that the appropriate federal banking agencies shall not be required to subject to such minimum requirements any person, to the extent that person acts in its capacity as a regulated insurance entity, if it is regulated by a state insurance regulator or is a regulated foreign subsidiary (or a regulated foreign affiliate of such subsidiary) engaged in the business of insurance.</summary>
