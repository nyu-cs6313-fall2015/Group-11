        uncompensated care for purposes of the limitation under 
        subparagraph (B), and may adjust such data so as to be an 
        appropriate proxy, including a downward adjustment to eliminate

                income for the taxable year derived from the provision 
                of physicians' services, $10,000.
            ``(3) Exclusion for services with respect to which any 
        reimbursement is received.--Physicians' services shall not be
