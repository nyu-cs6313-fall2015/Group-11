  <summary>11/21/2013--Introduced.
Quality Data, Quality Healthcare Act of 2013 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act (SSA) with respect to the use of certain data by qualified public or private entities to evaluate the performance of service providers and suppliers under Medicare insurance programs.

 Authorizes a qualified entity to: (1) use Medicare data, and information derived from service provider and supplier performance evaluations, for additional non-public analyses; or (2) provide or sell such data and analyses to specified health care-related entities for non-public use (including for purposes of assisting service providers and suppliers to develop and participate in quality and patient care improvement activities, particularly development of new models of care).

Conditions such authorization upon a data use agreement between a qualified entity and a specified health care-related entity under which the latter: (1) may not re-sell such data or analyses; and (2) shall comply with the qualified entity's privacy and security policies in using such data or analyses.

Prescribes a civil money penalty for unauthorized use of data and analyses.

Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide Medicare claims data to qualified clinical data registries for purposes of linking it with clinical outcomes data and performing and disseminating risk-adjusted, scientifically valid research to support quality improvement.

Prohibits a qualified clinical data registry from reporting publicly any claims data thus made available that individually identifies a service provider or supplier without prior consent.</summary>
