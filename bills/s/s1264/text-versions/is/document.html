_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To foster market development of clean energy fueling facilities by 
 steering infrastructure installation toward designated Clean Vehicle 
                               Corridors.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Vehicle Corridors Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Traditional transportation refueling networks are well-
        established, but market uncertainties continue to hamper the 
        full use of cleaner alternative domestic energy resources.
            (2) Despite considerable investor interest, higher capital 
        costs and an uncertain consumer base has limited expansion of 
        cleaner alternative refueling options and its customer base.
            (3) Reduced emissions and energy independence are important 
        factors at a National level, but they are not a sufficient 
        inducement to create large-scale changes.
            (4) While American-made fuels provide many energy security 
        and environmental benefits, a significant portion of imported 
        oil continues to be consumed as diesel fuel in on-road motor 
        vehicles.
            (5) Motor vehicles fueled by domestically generated, 
        cleaner alternative transportation fuels, such as compressed 
        natural gas, liquefied natural gas, propane, electricity, 
        hydrogen, and advanced biofuels, can pay for themselves over 
        time, but sales of such vehicles, other than return-to-base 
        vehicles, have been hampered because of insufficient refueling 
        infrastructure.
            (6) Simultaneous facilitation of infrastructure development 
        and a robust customer base is needed to avoid penalizing 
        current users or early adopters.
            (7) Facilitating focused infrastructure development along 
        designated routes will foster an expansion of cleaner 
        alternative fuel vehicles and increase the likelihood for 
        commercial success.
            (8) Eliminating the logistical barriers that are delaying 
        infrastructure development along Clean Vehicle Corridors will--
                    (A) provide cleaner alternative refueling stations 
                with a larger customer base;
                    (B) attract more buyers to the purchase of clean 
                vehicles; and
                    (C) provide new market outlets for clean fuel 
                providers.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to provide market certainty to drive private and 
        commercial capital investment in clean transportation options;
            (2) to promote clean transportation technologies that 
        will--
                    (A) lead to increased diversity and dissemination 
                of cleaner alternative fuel options; and
                    (B) enable the United States to bridge the gap from 
                foreign energy imports to secure, domestically produced 
                energy; and
            (3) to facilitate clean transportation incentives that 
        will--
                    (A) attract a critical mass of clean transportation 
                vehicles that will give cleaner alternative fueling 
                stations an assured customer base and market certitude;
                    (B) provide for ongoing increases in energy 
                demands;
                    (C) support the growth of jobs and businesses in 
                the United States;
                    (D) reduce emissions by motor vehicles;
                    (E) decrease our Nation's use of foreign oil; and
                    (F) encourage innovation in transportation energy 
                and technology.
