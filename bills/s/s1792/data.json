Requires each federal agency head that manages a covered grant account recommended for closure in such report\u00a0to close such account not later than 180 days after\u00a0the report is submitted. \n\nDefines \"covered grant account\" as a grant account in a federal agency payment management system that has a zero balance for more than 180 days and for which the grant award period has expired."
