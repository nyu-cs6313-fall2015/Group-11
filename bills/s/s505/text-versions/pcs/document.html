  To prohibit the use of drones to kill citizens of the United States 
                       within the United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. DRONES.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section--
            (1) the term ``drone'' means an unmanned aircraft (as 
        defined in section 331 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act 
        of 2012 (49 U.S.C. 40101 note));
            (2) the term ``serious bodily injury'' has the meaning 
        given that term in section 1365 of title 18, United States 
        Code; and
            (3) the term ``United States'' as used in a territorial 
        sense, has the meaning given that term in section 5 of title 
        18, United States Code.
    (b) Prohibition.--The Federal Government may not use a drone to 
kill a citizen of the United States who is located in the United 
States. The prohibition under this subsection shall not apply to an 
individual who poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily 
injury to another individual. Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to suggest that the Constitution would otherwise allow the 
killing of a citizen of the United States in the United States without 
due process of law.
