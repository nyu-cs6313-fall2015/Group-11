                   TITLE I--EMERGENCY DROUGHT RELIEF

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) as established in the Proclamation of a State of 
        Emergency issued by the Governor of the State on January 17, 
        2014, the State is experiencing record dry conditions;
            (2) extremely dry conditions have persisted in the State 
        since 2012, and the current drought conditions are likely to 
        persist into the future;
            (3) the water supplies of the State are at record-low 
        levels, as indicated by a statewide average snowpack of 12 
        percent of the normal average for winter as of February 1, 
        2014, and the fact that all major Central Valley Project 
        reservoir levels are below 50 percent of the capacity of the 
        reservoirs as of the date of enactment of this Act;
            (4) the 2013-2014 drought constitutes a serious emergency 
        posing immediate and severe risks to human life and safety and 
        to the environment throughout the State;
            (5) the emergency requires--
                    (A) immediate and credible action that respects the 
                complexity of the State of California's water system 
                and its importance to the entire State; and
                    (B) policies that do not pit stakeholders against 
                one another, which history has shown only leads to 
                costly litigation that benefits no one and prevents any 
                real solutions;
            (6) Federal law (including regulations) directly authorizes 
        expedited decisionmaking procedures and environmental and 
        public review procedures to enable timely and appropriate 
        implementation of actions to respond to such a type and 
        severity of emergency; and
            (7) the serious emergency posed by the 2013-2014 drought in 
        the State fully satisfies the conditions necessary for the 
        exercise of emergency decision making, analytical, and public 
        review requirements under--
                    (A) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
                1531 et seq.);
                    (B) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
                (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.);
                    (C) water control management procedures of the 
                Corps of Engineers described in section 222.5 of title 
                33, Code of Federal Regulations (including successor 
                regulations); and
                    (D) the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief 
                Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-250; 106 Stat. 53).

drought emergency by the Governor of the State, the Secretaries shall 
provide the maximum quantity of water supplies possible to Central 
Valley Project and Klamath Project agricultural, municipal and 
industrial, and refuge service and repayment contractors, State Water 
Project contractors, and any other locality or municipality in the 
State, by approving, consistent with applicable laws (including 
regulations)--
            (1) any project or operations to provide additional water 
        supplies if there is any possible way whatsoever that the 
        Secretaries can do so unless the project or operations 
        constitute a highly inefficient way of providing additional 
        water supplies; and
            (2) any projects or operations as quickly as possible based 
        on available information to address the emergency conditions.
    (b) Mandate.--In carrying out subsection (a), the applicable agency 
heads described in that subsection shall, consistent with applicable 
laws (including regulations)--
            (1) authorize and implement actions to ensure that the 
        Delta Cross Channel Gates shall remain open to the greatest 
        extent possible, timed to maximize the peak flood tide period 
        and provide water supply and water quality benefits for the 
        duration of the State's drought emergency declaration, 
        consistent with operational criteria and monitoring criteria 
        developed pursuant to the California State Water Resources 
        Control Board's Order Approving a Temporary Urgency Change in 
        License and Permit Terms in Response to Drought Conditions, 
        effective January 31, 2014, or a successor order;
            (2)(A) collect data associated with the operation of the 
        Delta Cross Channel Gates described in paragraph (1) and its 
        impact on species listed as threatened or endangered under the 
        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), water 
        quality, and water supply; and
            (B) after assessing the data described in subparagraph (A), 
        require the Director of the National Marine Fisheries Service 
        to recommend revisions to operations of the Central Valley 
        Project and the California State Water Project, including, if 
        appropriate, the reasonable and prudent alternatives contained 
        in the biological opinion issued by the National Marine 
        Fisheries Service on June 4, 2009, that are likely to produce 
        fishery, water quality, and water supply benefits;
            (3)(A) implement turbidity control strategies that allow 
        for increased water deliveries while avoiding jeopardy to adult 
        delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) due to entrainment at 
        Central Valley Project and State Water Project pumping plants; 
        and
            (B) manage reverse flow in Old and Middle Rivers as 
        prescribed by the biological opinion issued by the United

        barriers or operable gates in Delta channels to improve water 
        quantity and quality for State Water Project and Central Valley 
        Project South of Delta water contractors and other water users, 
        which barriers or gates should provide benefits for species 
        protection and in-Delta water user water quality and shall be 
        designed such that formal consultations under section 7 of the 
        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536) would not be 
        necessary;
            (6)(A) require the Director of the United States Fish and 
        Wildlife Service and the Commissioner of the Bureau of 
        Reclamation to complete all requirements under the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and 
        the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)

                 TITLE II--FEDERAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE

SEC. 201. TREATMENT OF DROUGHT UNDER THE ROBERT T. STAFFORD DISASTER 
              RELIEF AND EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE ACT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the term ``major disaster'' (as defined in section 102 
        of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
        Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122)) includes drought, yet no 
        drought in the 30 years preceding the date of enactment of this 
        Act has been declared by the President to be a major disaster 
        in any of the States in accordance with section 401 of that Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 5170);
            (2) a major drought shall be eligible to be declared a 
        major disaster or state of emergency by the President on the 
        request of the Governor of any State;
            (3) droughts are natural disasters that do occur, and while 
        of a different type of impact, the scale of the impact of a 
        major drought can be equivalent to other disasters that have 
        been declared by the President to be a major disaster under the 
        Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.); and
            (4) droughts have wide-ranging and long-term impacts on 
        ecosystem health, agriculture production, permanent crops, 
        forests, waterways, air quality, public health, wildlife, 
        employment, communities, State and national parks, and other 
        natural resources of a State and the people of that State that 
        have significant value.
    (b) Federal Emergency Assistance.--Section 502(a) of the Robert T. 
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 
5192(a)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (7), by striking ``and'' after the 
        semicolon at the end;
            (2) in paragraph (8), by striking the period at the end and 
        inserting a semicolon; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(9) provide disaster unemployment assistance in 
        accordance with section 410;
            ``(10) provide emergency nutrition and other assistance in 
        accordance with section 412; and
