SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) as established in the Proclamation of a State of 
        Emergency issued by the Governor of the State on January 17, 
        2014, the State is experiencing record dry conditions;
            (2) extremely dry conditions have persisted in the State 
        since 2012, and the drought conditions are likely to persist 
        into the future;
            (3) the water supplies of the State are at record-low 
        levels, as indicated by a statewide average snowpack of 12 
        percent of the normal average for winter as of February 1, 
        2014, and the fact that all major Central Valley Project 
        reservoir levels are at or below 50 percent of the capacity of 
        the reservoirs as of April 1, 2014;
            (4) the 2013-2014 drought constitutes a serious emergency 
        posing immediate and severe risks to human life and safety and 
        to the environment throughout the State;
            (5) the emergency requires--
                    (A) immediate and credible action that respects the 
                complexity of the water system of the State and the 
                importance of the water system to the entire State; and
                    (B) policies that do not pit stakeholders against 
                one another, which history has shown only leads to 
                costly litigation that benefits no one and prevents any 
                real solutions;
            (6) Federal law (including regulations) directly authorizes 
        expedited decisionmaking procedures and environmental and 
        public review procedures to enable timely and appropriate 
        implementation of actions to respond to such a type and 
        severity of emergency; and
            (7) the serious emergency posed by the 2013-2014 drought in 
        the State fully satisfies the conditions necessary for the 
        exercise of emergency decisionmaking, analytical, and public 
        review requirements under--
                    (A) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
                1531 et seq.);
                    (B) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
                (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.);
                    (C) water control management procedures of the 
                Corps of Engineers described in section 222.5 of title 
                33, Code of Federal Regulations (including successor 
                regulations); and
                    (D) the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief 
                Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-250; 106 Stat. 53).
