        apply in cases in which domestic livestock grazing is used in 
        an authorized wildfire prevention project.
    (d) Timber Harvesting and Thinning.--Timber harvesting and thinning 
may be used in an authorized wildfire prevention project to reduce 
ladder and canopy fuel loads to prevent wildfire (including 
catastrophic wildfire).
