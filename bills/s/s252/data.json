Directs the Advisory Committee (or an existing advisory committee designated by the Secretary) to develop, and periodically review and revise, a plan for conducting and supporting research, education, and programs on preterm birth through HHS.\n\nRequires the Secretary to designate an appropriate agency within HHS to coordinate existing studies and report to the Secretary and Congress on hospital readmissions of preterm infants.\n\nTitle II: National Pediatric Research Network - National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013 - (Sec. 202) Amends the Public Health Service Act to authorize the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in carrying out the Pediatric Research Initiative, to consult with the Director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to provide for the establishment of a National Pediatric Research Network.\n\nAuthorizes the Director of the Institute to award funding to public or private nonprofit entities for providing support for pediatric research consortia, including with respect to basic, clinical, behavioral, or translational research and the training of researchers in pediatric research techniques. Requires consortia to be formed from a collaboration of cooperating institutions, coordinated by a lead institution or institutions, agree to disseminate scientific findings rapidly and efficiently to other consortia, NIH, FDA, and other relevant agencies, and meet requirements prescribed by the Director of NIH. Allows such support to be for a period of five years, with additional extensions at the discretion of the Director of NIH.\n\nRequires the Director of NIH to provide for the coordination of activities among the consortia and to require the periodic preparation and submission of reports on their activities. Requires each pediatric research consortium receiving an award to assist the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the establishment or expansion of patient registries and other surveillance systems as appropriate and upon request by the CDC.\n\nRequires the Director of NIH to ensure that an appropriate number of such awards are awarded to consortia that agree to: (1) consider pediatric rare diseases or conditions or those related to birth defects; and (2) conduct or coordinate one or more multisite clinical trials of therapies for, or approaches to, the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of one or more pediatric rare diseases or conditions.\n\nTitle III: CHIMP Act Amendments - CHIMP Act Amendments of 2013 - (Sec. 302) Amends the Public Health Service Act, with respect to the lifetime care of chimpanzees used in federally conducted or supported medical research, to revise the sanctuary system of care, maintenance, and transportation of all chimpanzees under the ownership and control of NIH to: (1) authorize appropriations, in declining amounts, for FY2014-FY2018; (2) eliminate a restriction on reservation of funds for a fiscal year that requires appropriations to equal or exceed amounts appropriated for FY1999; and (3) require the use of funds for other compliant facilities to be determined by the Secretary (rather than, as under current law, by the board of directors of the nonprofit entity operating the facility).\n\n Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to evaluate: (1) the research status of NIH-owned or -controlled chimpanzees; (2) the costs of care and maintenance, broken down by research or retirement status, services included, and location; (3) the extent to which requirements that a nonprofit private entity match funding have been met; and (4) any options for cost savings for support and maintenance.\n\nRequires the Director of NIH to report to Congress, with biennial updates, on: (1) the care, maintenance, and transportation of the chimpanzees under NIH ownership or control; (2) related costs; and (3) the research status of such chimpanzees."
