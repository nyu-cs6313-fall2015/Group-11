  <summary>11/21/2013--Introduced.
Child Support Enforcement Effectiveness Act of 2013 - Establishes the Commission on Child Support to evaluate the effectiveness of existing child support enforcement programs and collection practices employed by state agencies administering programs under part D (Child Support and Establishment of Paternity) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA).

Amends part D of SSA title IV to repeal the exclusion from federal matching payments of any amounts expended by a state from child support incentive payments it has received from the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). (Thus reinstates federal matching of state spending of child support incentive payments.)</summary>
