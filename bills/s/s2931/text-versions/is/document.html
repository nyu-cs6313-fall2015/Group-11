                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 to provide for 
 regulatory impact analyses for certain rules and consideration of the 
    least burdensome regulatory alternative, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Unfunded Mandates Accountability Act 
of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The public has a right to know the benefits and costs 
        of regulation. Effective regulatory programs provide important 
        benefits to the public, including protecting the environment, 
        worker safety, and human health. Regulations also impose 
        significant costs on individuals, employers, and State, local, 
        and tribal governments, diverting resources from other 
        important priorities.
            (2) Better regulatory analysis and review should improve 
        the quality of agency decisions, increasing the benefits and 
        reducing unwarranted costs of regulation.
            (3) Disclosure and scrutiny of key information underlying 
        agency decisions should make the Federal Government more 
        accountable to the public it serves.

SEC. 3. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSES FOR CERTAIN RULES.

    (a) Regulatory Impact Analyses for Certain Rules.--Section 202 of 
the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1532) is amended--

        following:

``SEC. 202. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSES FOR CERTAIN RULES.'';

            (2) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections 
        (d) and (e), respectively;
            (3) by striking subsection (a) and inserting the following:
    ``(a) Definition.--In this section, the term `cost' means the cost
