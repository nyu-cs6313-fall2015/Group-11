    Notwithstanding the sequestration order issued by the President

Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901a(7)(A)), there shall be

and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901 and 901a), 
sections 3001 and 3004 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing

        inserting the following:
            ``(2) Eliminating a breach.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Each nonexempt account within a 
                category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated 
                by multiplying the enacted level of sequesterable 
                budgetary resources in that account at that time by the 
                uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach 
                within that category.
                    ``(B) Overseas contingencies.--Any amount of budget 
                authority for overseas contingency operations and 
                related activities for fiscal years 2014 through 2016 
                in excess of the levels set in subsection 251(b)(2)(E) 
                shall be counted in determining whether a breach has 
                occurred in the security category.''; and
            (2) in subsection (b)(2)--
                    (A) in subparagraph (A)(ii), by inserting ``for 
                fiscal years 2017 through 2021,'' before ``the 
                Congress''; and
                    (B) by inserting at the end the following:
                    ``(E) Overseas contingency operations/global war on 
                terrorism.--If, for fiscal years 2014 through 2016, 
                appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted 
                that Congress designates for Overseas Contingency 
                Operations/Global War on Terrorism in statute on an 
                account by account basis, the adjustment for the fiscal 
                year shall be the total of such appropriations for the 
                fiscal year in discretionary accounts designated as 
                being for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on 
                Terrorism, but not to exceed--
                            ``(i) for fiscal year 2014, $92,289,000,000 
                        in additional new budget authority;
                            ``(ii) for fiscal year 2015, 
                        $37,283,000,000 in additional new budget 
                        authority; and
                            ``(iii) for fiscal year 2016, 
                        $37,283,000,000 in additional new budget 
                        authority.''.
