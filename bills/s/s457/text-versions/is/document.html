                                 A BILL


 
  To posthumously award a Congressional gold medal to Alice Paul, in 
    recognition of her role in the women's suffrage movement and in 
                   advancing equal rights for women.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Alice Paul Congressional Gold Medal 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Alice Paul was born on January, 11, 1885, in Mount 
        Laurel, New Jersey, and died on July 9, 1977.
            (2) Alice Paul dedicated her life to securing suffrage and 
        equal rights for all women and, as founder of the National 
        Woman's Party, she was instrumental in the passage of the 19th 
        Amendment to the United States Constitution.
            (3) Alice Paul and the National Woman's Party were the 
        first group ever to picket the White House.
            (4) While President Woodrow Wilson trumpeted America's 
        values of democracy abroad during World War I, Alice Paul was 
        dedicated to reminding the President that not all Americans 
        enjoyed democracy at home.
            (5) Alice Paul used nonviolent civil disobedience to bring 
        national attention to the women's suffrage movement, such as 
        the hunger strike she undertook when she was sentenced to jail 
        in October 1917, for her demonstrations.
            (6) Alice Paul's courage inspired thousands of women to 
        join the women's suffrage movement.
            (7) Instead of patiently waiting for States to grant women 
        suffrage, Alice Paul mobilized an entire generation of women to 
        pressure the United States Congress and the President to give 
        all women in America the right to vote.
            (8) Alice Paul did not stop her fight after the 19th 
        Amendment was ratified. She drafted the Equal Rights Amendment 
        to the United States Constitution in 1923 and fought tirelessly 
        for its passage until her death 54 years later.
            (9) Alice Paul lobbied Congress to include gender in civil 
        rights bills and was successful in including sex discrimination 
        in title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
            (10) Alice Paul sought equal rights for women all over the 
        world, not just Americans and, as a means of pursuing this 
        goal, founded the World Party for Equal Rights for Women in the 
        1930s.
            (11) Alice Paul was instrumental in the placement of a 
        passage on gender equality in the preamble of the United 
        Nations Charter.
            (12) Few people have played a greater role in shaping the 
        history of the United States than Alice Paul.
            (13) Alice Paul is an example to all Americans of what one 
        person can do to make a difference for millions of people.
