Requires payment to be made for such a resubmitted claim for all furnished items and services for which payment may be made under Medicare part B.\n\nDeems to be a reopened claim, for purposes of a hospital's ability to resubmit a claim for Medicare payment in timely fashion, any claim that is the subject of an audit by a recovery audit contractor or a Medicare administrative contractor.\n\nRequires contracts for a recovery audit contractor to require that a physician review each denial of a claim for medical necessity made by an employee of the contractor who is not a physician.\n\nSubjects to administrative and judicial review the Secretary's compliance with guidelines for reopening and revising benefit determinations."
