_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To establish a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Master 
                         Teacher Corps program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``STEM Master Teacher Corps Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Numerous recent reports by national advisory groups, 
        including the President's Council of Advisors on Science and 
        Technology and National Academies' committees, have highlighted 
        the need to raise student achievement in STEM fields to enable 
        the United States to maintain its competitive edge in the 
        global economy.
            (2) Success in the American workforce increasingly requires 
        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics skills.
            (3) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will 
        be 6,750,000 STEM-related job openings by 2020, as defined by 
        the Occupational Information Network.
            (4) Recent standardized tests show United States students' 
        mathematics and science performance is only average or below 
        average compared with their international peers. According to 
        the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, 
        60 percent of U.S. eighth graders failed to meet the 
        intermediate international benchmark in mathematics and 27 
        percent failed to reach the same benchmark in science.
            (5) Too few American students graduate from high school 
        with the interest and the preparation to successfully pursue 
        STEM degrees in college. Well over half of college students in 
        China and Japan major in STEM fields, compared with only a 
        third of U.S. students.
            (6) Several researchers, including at Stanford University, 
        have found that the effects of well-prepared teachers on 
        student achievement can be stronger than the influences of 
        student background factors, such as poverty, language 
        background, and minority status.
            (7) The Harvard Graduate School of Education report ``Who 
        Stays in Teaching and Why'' cites research that shows more 
        young people would consider teaching if it offered more 
        opportunities for advancement, and that if schools fail to 
        offer teachers these opportunities throughout their teaching 
        careers, they may risk losing them permanently. It also reports 
        that well implemented mentoring and induction programs provide 
        the support novices need to feel satisfied and remain in their 
        schools.
            (8) Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have 
        found that STEM teachers migrate within the teaching profession 
        to better paying jobs at better-funded schools, resulting in 
        local imbalances and leaving schools in high-poverty 
        communities struggling to find knowledgeable teachers.
            (9) Individuals with strong STEM skills have opportunities 
        for more lucrative careers outside of teaching. According to 
        the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
        (OECD), the United States ranks in the bottom third of OECD 
        countries in terms of teacher salary relative to other 
        occupations requiring tertiary education. Furthermore, data 
        from the National Association of Colleges and Employers show 
        the average salary offered to recent college graduates in 2012 
        in certain STEM-related fields was up to $20,000 higher than 
        that offered to new secondary school teachers and up to $23,000 
        higher than that offered to new elementary school and middle 
        school teachers.

SEC. 3. STEM MASTER TEACHER CORPS.

    (a) In General.--Subpart 5 of part A of title II of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6651 et seq.) is 
amended--
