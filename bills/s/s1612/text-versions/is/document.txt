                commercialization of technologies developed by one or

        inventor of or an original assignee to an asserted patent;

        sells a product related to the subject matter described in an 
        asserted patent;

        demonstrate that it has and will have the ability to pay the 
        accused infringer's fees and other expenses if ordered to do 
        so; and
            ``(7) whether any party will agree to pay the accused 
        infringer's shifted fees and other expenses, provided that the 
        person or entity can demonstrate that it has and will have the 
        ability to pay the accused infringer's shifted fees and other
