                                 A BILL


 
           To authorize grants for the support of caregivers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``In-Home Caregiver Assessment 
Resources and Education Act'' or the ``In-Home CARE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) More than 65,000,000 unpaid caregivers provide care for 
        a chronically ill, disabled, or aged family member or friend 
        during any given year.
            (2) Sixty-six percent of unpaid caregivers are women. More 
        than 37 percent of caregivers live with children or 
        grandchildren who are under 18 years old.
            (3) Unpaid family caregivers spend an average of 20 hours 
        per week caring for their loved ones, and 13 percent of family 
        caregivers provide 40 or more hours of care per week.
            (4) Thirty-six percent of caregivers care for a parent.
            (5) Fourteen percent of caregivers care for a special needs 
        child, including an estimated 16,800,000 caregivers who care 
        for special needs children who are under 18 years old.
            (6) In 2007, the average caregiver for someone 50 years or 
        older spent $5,531 per year on out-of-pocket caregiving 
        expenses, which is more than 10 percent of the median income 
        for a family caregiver for that year. Forty-seven percent of 
        working caregivers have used up all or most of their savings 
        due to caregiving expenses.
            (7) Seventy-three percent of caregivers who provide care 
        for an individual over the age of 18 are currently working or 
        have worked while providing care. Sixty-six percent of such 
        caregivers have had to make some modifications to their work 
        schedule, from arriving late to work to leaving their job 
        entirely. One in 5 caregivers have had to take time off from 
        work.
            (8) Fifty-three percent of caregivers have experienced a 
        decline in their health as a result of caregiving, which has 
        affected their ability to provide care.
            (9) Forty-six percent of caregivers perform medical or 
        nursing tasks for patients with multiple physical and chronic 
        conditions. Of these caregivers, 78 percent were in charge of 
        managing a patient's medications, administering fluids, or 
        administering injections.
            (10) Nearly 20 percent of caregivers who assisted with 
        medication management and 33 percent who assisted with changing 
        dressings or bandages received no training about how to perform 
        these tasks.
            (11) The vast majority (78 percent) of caregivers indicated 
        they need more support related to caregiving.
            (12) Home visiting programs are cost-effective and have 
        been proven to improve outcomes for children and parents in 
        different domains ranging from child development to family 
        violence.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to improve the ability of unpaid caregivers to care for 
        individuals in the home; and
            (2) to increase opportunities for individuals who are in 
        need of care to remain at home and reduce or postpone the need 
        for such individuals to receive care at an institution.
