                                 A BILL


 
             To reform America's broken immigration system.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Immigration Reform that Works for 
America's Future Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should--
            (1) create a roadmap for immigrants who are here without 
        legal status to earn citizenship, provided they pay taxes, 
        complete a background check, learn English, and show a 
        commitment to America;
            (2) allow students who came to America as children to earn 
        citizenship by attending college or joining the Armed Forces;
            (3) protect the sustainability of the American agricultural 
        industry, including the dairy industry, with a stable and legal 
        agricultural workforce;
            (4) encourage those who seek to invest in the United States 
        and create American jobs;
            (5) permit and encourage individuals who earn an advanced 
        degree from one of our world-class universities to remain in 
        the United States, rather than using that education to work for 
        our international competitors;
            (6) fulfill and strengthen our Nation's commitments 
        regarding security along our borders and at our ports of entry;
            (7) strengthen our Nation's historic humanitarian tradition 
        of welcoming asylum seekers and refugees and improve existing 
        policies that support immigrant victims of crime and domestic 
        violence;
            (8) create an effective electronic verification system and 
        strengthen enforcement to prevent employers from hiring people 
        here illegally;
            (9) implement a rational legal immigration system that 
        promotes job creation by converting the current flow of illegal 
        immigrants into the United States into a more manageable, 
        controlled, and legal process for admitting immigrants while, 
        at the same time, safeguarding the jobs, rights, and wages of 
        American workers; and
            (10) adopt practical and fair immigration reforms to help 
        ensure that all families are able to be together.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
