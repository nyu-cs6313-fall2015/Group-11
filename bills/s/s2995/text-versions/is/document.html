municipalities under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 
1251 et seq.) in a more cost-effective and flexible manner.
    (b) Framework.--The Administrator shall carry out the pilot program 
in a manner that is consistent with the Integrated Municipal Stormwater

    (c) Selection of Eligible Municipalities.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator, in consultation with 
        States that have approved National Pollutant Discharge

            (2) Eligible municipality.--An eligible municipality is a

                            (i) eligible municipalities that are 
                        operating under an administrative order, 
                        administrative consent agreement, or judicial

                        planning and implementing control measures to 
                        address wet weather discharges from wastewater 
                        and stormwater facilities of the eligible 
                        municipalities; and
                            (iii) eligible municipalities with a

                    (B) Use of adaptive management approaches.--In 
                selecting eligible municipalities to participate in the 
                pilot program, the Administrator may give priority to 
                an eligible municipality that is seeking to develop and 
                implement an integrated plan that includes adaptive 
                approaches to account for changed or future uncertain 
                circumstances, including, at a minimum--
                            (i) the use of new innovative technical or

                        plan in response to new regulatory requirements

                    (A) account for the financial capability of the 
                eligible municipality to adequately address the 
                requirements of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act 
                (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) that apply to the eligible 
                municipality;
                    (B) prioritize the obligations of the eligible 
                municipality under the Federal Water Pollution Control 
                Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) according to the most 
                cost-effective and environmentally beneficial outcomes;
                    (C) account for the maintenance, operational, and 
                regulatory obligations of the eligible municipality; 
                and
                    (D) enable the eligible municipality to implement 
                innovative and flexible approaches to meet the 
                obligations of the eligible municipality under the 
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et

            (2) Additional authorities.--In carrying out the pilot 
        program established under subsection (a), the Administrator 
        may, in full coordination and mutual agreement with an eligible 
        municipality selected to participate in the pilot program--
                    (A) extend the allowable national pollutant 
                discharge elimination system permit term under section 
                402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 
                U.S.C. 1342) to a maximum of 25 years, and make 
                corresponding changes to any associated implementation 
                schedule;
                    (B) modify the implementation terms of a consent 
                decree entered into by the eligible municipality with

                et seq.) in approving and implementing an integrated 
                plan that includes adaptive approaches in order to 
                encourage the innovation integral to such approaches.
    (e) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter for 5 years, the
