    (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 12 of title 11, United 
States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 1232. Claim by a governmental unit based on the disposition of 
              property used in a farming operation
    ``(a) Any unsecured claim of a governmental unit against the debtor 
or the estate that arises before the filing of the petition, or that 
arises after the filing of the petition and before the debtor's 
discharge under section 1228, as a result of the sale, transfer, 
exchange, or other disposition of any property used in the debtor's 
farming operation--
            ``(1) shall be treated as an unsecured claim arising before 
        the date on which the petition is filed;
            ``(2) shall not be entitled to priority under section 507;
            ``(3) shall be provided for under a plan; and
            ``(4) shall be discharged in accordance with section 1228.
    ``(b) For purposes of applying sections 1225(a)(4), 1228(b)(2), and 
1229(b)(1) to a claim described in subsection (a) of this section, the 
amount that would be paid on such claim if the estate of the debtor 
were liquidated in a case under chapter 7 of this title shall be the 
amount that would be paid by the estate in a chapter 7 case if the 
claim were an unsecured claim arising before the date on which the 
petition was filed and were not entitled to priority under section 507.
    ``(c) For purposes of applying sections 523(a), 1228(a)(2), and 
1228(c)(2) to a claim described in subsection (a) of this section, the 
claim shall not be treated as a claim of a kind specified in section 
523(a)(1).
    ``(d)(1) A governmental unit may file a proof of claim for a claim 
described in subsection (a) that arises after the date on which the 
petition is filed.
    ``(2) If a debtor files a tax return after the filing of the 
petition for a period in which a claim described in subsection (a) 
arises, and the claim relates to the tax return, the debtor shall serve 
notice of the claim on the governmental unit charged with the 
responsibility for the collection of the tax at the address and in the 
manner designated in section 505(b)(1). Notice under this paragraph 
shall state that the debtor has filed a petition under this chapter, 
state the name and location of the court in which the case under this 
chapter is pending, state the amount of the claim, and include a copy 
of the filed tax return and documentation supporting the calculation of 
the claim.
    ``(3) If notice of a claim has been served on the governmental unit 
in accordance with paragraph (2), the governmental unit may file a 
proof of claim not later than 180 days after the date on which such 
notice was served. If the governmental unit has not filed a timely 
proof of the claim, the debtor or trustee may file proof of the claim 
that is consistent with the notice served under paragraph (2). If a 
proof of claim is filed by the debtor or trustee under this paragraph, 
the governmental unit may not amend the proof of claim.
    ``(4) A claim filed under this subsection shall be determined and 
shall be allowed under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of section 502, or 
disallowed under subsection (d) or (e) of section 502, in the same 
manner as if the claim had arisen immediately before the date of the 
filing of the petition.''.
