                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Secretary of the Treasury to study the feasibility of 
providing certain taxpayers with an optional, pre-prepared tax return, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Simpler Tax Filing Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of the Treasury should provide as many 
        taxpayers as possible with the option of receiving a tax return 
        that is pre-prepared by the Secretary of the Treasury; and
            (2) it should be the goal of the Internal Revenue Service 
        to begin offering pre-prepared returns to filers by tax year 
        2018.

SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.

    Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Taxpayer 
Advocate Service, shall provide a report to the Committee on Ways and 
Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of 
the Senate on actions necessary to achieve the goal of offering pre-
prepared tax returns to filers by tax year 2018, including--
            (1) changes necessary to the filing deadlines for employers 
        and institutions for information provided through Forms W-2 and 
        1099;
            (2) actions necessary to expedite processing of information 
        from Form W-2 by the Social Security Administration;
            (3) actions necessary to expedite processing of information 
        reporting by the Internal Revenue Service;
            (4) actions to help businesses submit Form W-2 more easily, 
        and electronically;
            (5) partnerships with employers and financial institutions 
        to encourage early reporting;
            (6) delaying the start of the tax filing season;
            (7) ensuring that taxpayers have access to secure online 
        accounts to access their information, while also having the 
        option to download their information for integration into 
        private tax preparation software; and
            (8) incorporating best practices from other countries for 
        expediting the availability of return information.
Such report shall also include an analysis of the budgetary, 
administrative, and legislative barriers to achieving this goal, 
including the amount of appropriations that would be required.
                                 <all>
