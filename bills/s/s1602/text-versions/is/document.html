    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense may declassify documents

least one case of a disability that a member of the medical profession 
has determined to be associated with that toxic substance.

shall be limited to information necessary for an individual who was

            (1) Whether that individual was exposed to that toxic 
        substance.
            (2) The potential severity of the exposure of that 
        individual to that toxic substance.

        from exposure to that toxic substance.
    (c) Exception.--The Secretary of Defense is not required to 
declassify documents if the Secretary determines that declassification 
of those documents would materially and immediately threaten the 
security of the United States.
