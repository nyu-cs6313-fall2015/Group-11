  <summary>7/17/2014--Introduced.
Fair Share Act of 2014 - Consolidates and amends three federal programs that provide payments to local governments that have federal lands within their borders: the Department of the Interior's Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, the Forest Service's Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Refuge Revenue Sharing (RRS) program.

Expands the definition of "entitlement land" eligible for payment under the Department of the Interior's PILT program to include land owned by the U.S. government that was purchased for addition to the National Wildlife Refuge System.

Combines the PILT, SRS, and RRS programs into one expanded PILT program, and alters the formulas for allocating payments under the programs.

Provides permanent mandatory funding for the PILT program.

Provides funding in FY2014-FY2018 for resource advisory committees created under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000, and permits them to propose vegetation management projects, including projects authorized under the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003.</summary>
