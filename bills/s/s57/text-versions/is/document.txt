                1105 the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a 
                message on the public debt limit.
                    ``(B) Contents.--The message shall include an

                to be increased, if necessary, for the period of time 
                between the submission of the current Secretarial 
                message and the Secretarial message that will be 
                submitted the following year, as required by

        the public debt limit that would be necessary to accommodate 
        the requirements described in paragraph (2)(B).
