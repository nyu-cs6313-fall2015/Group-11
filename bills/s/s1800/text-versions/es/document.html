SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Bureau of Reclamation Transparency 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the water resources infrastructure of the Bureau of 
        Reclamation provides important benefits related to irrigated 
        agriculture, municipal and industrial water, hydropower, flood 
        control, fish and wildlife, and recreation in the 17 
        Reclamation States;
            (2) as of 2013, the combined replacement value of the 
        infrastructure assets of the Bureau of Reclamation was 
        $94,500,000,000;
            (3) the majority of the water resources infrastructure 
        facilities of the Bureau of Reclamation are at least 60 years 
        old;
            (4) the Bureau of Reclamation has previously undertaken 
        efforts to better manage the assets of the Bureau of 
        Reclamation, including an annual review of asset maintenance 
        activities of the Bureau of Reclamation known as the ``Asset 
        Management Plan''; and
            (5) actionable information on infrastructure conditions at 
        the asset level, including information on maintenance needs at 
        individual assets due to aging infrastructure, is needed for 
        Congress to conduct oversight of Reclamation facilities and 
        meet the needs of the public.
