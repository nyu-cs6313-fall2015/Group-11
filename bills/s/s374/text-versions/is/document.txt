                                 A BILL


 
 To ensure that all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a 
 firearm are listed in the national instant criminal background check 
     system and require a background check for every firearm sale.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Congress supports and respects the right to bear arms 
        found in the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
        States.
            (2) Congress supports the existing prohibition on a 
        national firearms registry.
            (3) There are deficits in the background check system in 
        effect before the date of enactment of this Act and the 
        Department of Justice should make it a top priority to work 
        with States to swiftly input missing records, including mental 
        health records.
            (4) If the citizens of the United States agree that in 
        order to promote safe and responsible gun ownership criminals 
        and the mentally ill should be prohibited from possessing 
        firearms, it should be incumbent upon all citizens to ensure 
        weapons are not being transferred to such people.
                                 <all>
