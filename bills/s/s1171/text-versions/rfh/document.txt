veterinarian shall not be required to have a separate registration in 
order to transport and dispense controlled substances in the usual 
course of veterinary practice at a site other than the registrant's 
registered principal place of business or professional practice, so 
long as the site of transporting and dispensing is located in a State 
where the veterinarian is licensed to practice veterinary medicine and 
is not a principal place of business or professional practice.''.

            Passed the Senate January 8, 2014.
