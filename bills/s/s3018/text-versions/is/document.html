                requirements of section 6222(a) with respect to its 
                interest in such other partnership shall be treated as

        penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount for which it 
        would have been liable if such partnership had been an 
        individual subject to tax under chapter 1 for the reviewed year 
        and the imputed underpayment were an actual underpayment (or 
        understatement) for such year.

        deposits with the Secretary, on or before the date the petition 
        is filed, the amount of the imputed underpayment (as of the

items among the partners, and the applicability of any penalty, 
addition to tax, or additional amount for which the partnership may be 
liable under this subchapter.
    ``(d) Determination of Court Reviewable.--Any determination by a 
court under this section shall have the force and effect of a decision 
of the Tax Court or a final judgment or decree of the district court or 
the Claims Court, as the case may be, and shall be reviewable as such. 
The date of any such determination shall be treated as being the date 
of the court's order entering the decision.
    ``(e) Effect of Decision Dismissing Action.--If an action brought 
under this section is dismissed other than by reason of a rescission 
under section 6231(c), the decision of the court dismissing the action 
shall be considered as its decision that the notice of final 
partnership adjustment is correct, and an appropriate order shall be 
entered in the records of the court.
