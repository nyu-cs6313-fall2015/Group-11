        Housing and Urban Development (in this Act referred to as the 
        ``Secretary'') the flexibility to design and implement various 
        approaches for providing and administering housing assistance 
        that achieves greater cost effectiveness in using Federal 
        housing assistance to address local housing needs for low-
        income families;
            (2) to reduce administrative burdens on public housing 
        agencies providing such assistance;
            (3) to give incentives to assisted families to work and 
        become economically self-sufficient;
            (4) to increase housing choices for low-income families; 
        and

        and persons with disabilities to live independently.

            (3) the need for a diversity of participants in terms of

                                    (V) was prepared in accordance with 
                                a public process as described in clause 
                                (iv);
                            (iv) describe and document how a public 
                        housing agency has provided residents assisted 
                        under a charter contract and the wider 
                        community with opportunities to participate in 
                        the development of and comment on the annual

                            (v) include such other information as may 
                        be required by the Secretary pursuant to 
                        subsection (f)(2).
            (2) Review.--Any charter report submitted pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) shall be deemed approved unless the Secretary, 
        not later than 45 days after the date of submission of such 
        report, issues a written disapproval because--
                    (A) the Secretary reasonably determines, based on 
                information contained in the report, that a public 
                housing agency is not in compliance with the provisions 
                of this section or other applicable law; or
                    (B) such report is inconsistent with other reliable 
                information available to the Secretary.
    (f) Records and Audits.--
            (1) Keeping of records.--Each public housing agency shall 
        keep such records as the Secretary may prescribe as reasonably 
        necessary--
                    (A) to disclose the amounts and the disposition of 
                amounts under the Moving to Work Charter program 
                established under this section;
                    (B) to ensure compliance with the requirements of 
                this section; and
                    (C) to measure performance.
            (2) Access to documents by the secretary.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall have access 
                for the purpose of audit and examination to any books, 
                documents, papers, and records that are pertinent to 
                assistance in connection with, and the requirements of, 
                this section.
                    (B) Limitation.--Access by the Secretary described 
                under subparagraph (A) shall be limited to information 
                obtained solely through the annual charter report 
                submitted by a public housing agency under subsection 
                (e), unless the Secretary has reason to believe that 
                such agency is not in compliance with the charter 
                contract between the Secretary and such agency.
            (3) Access to documents by the comptroller general.--The
