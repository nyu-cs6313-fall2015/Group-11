Requires the Secretary, if such a determination is made, to move the Lookout to a location outside of the lands specified in this Act and designated as a wilderness area.\n\n Directs the Secretary of the Interior to approve the Alaska Native Veteran Allotment application numbered AA-084021-B and to issue the applicant a patent for the 80 acres of federal land identified as Lot 2.\n\nLimits the patent to surface rights only and subjects it to the terms and conditions of any certificate issued under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) with respect to the conveyance of certain federal lands in Alaska to certain Alaska Native veterans, including those providing that: (1) the patent is subject to valid existing rights, including any U.S. right to income derived from a lease, license, permit, right-of-way, or easement on the federal land; and (2) the United States shall reserve an interest in deposits of oil, gas, and coal on the land, including the right to explore, mine, and remove the minerals on parts of the land that are prospectively valuable for development."
