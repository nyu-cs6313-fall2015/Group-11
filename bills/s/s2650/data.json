Reinstates by action of law on November 28, 2014, any sanctions on Iran that have been waived, suspended, or otherwise reduced in connection with Iran's nuclear program, unless before that date the President submits to Congress a comprehensive and long-term agreement that: (1) addresses all key aspects of Iran's nuclear program, and (2) is significantly longer in duration than any previous U.S.-Iran nuclear agreement."
