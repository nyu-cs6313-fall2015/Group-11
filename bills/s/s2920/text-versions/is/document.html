                                 A BILL


 
To deny Social Security benefits and other benefits to individuals who 
                   participated in Nazi persecution.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Nazi Social Security Benefits 
Termination Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States of America serves as a beacon of 
        refuge to thousands of victims fleeing religious, ethnic, 
        racial, and other forms of persecution around the world and has 
        become the home to thousands of survivors of the Nazi 
        Holocaust.
            (2) In order to safeguard the integrity of the refugee and 
        asylum system that has provided safety to those who fled the 
        Holocaust, and in order to ensure that those survivors do not 
        have to share their adopted homeland with their former 
        persecutors, the policy of the United States has been that this 
        country should not provide safe haven for those who 
        participated in acts of Nazi persecution.
            (3) Congress enacted laws specifically to exclude or to 
        remove participants of Nazi persecution from the United States 
        and never intended that those individuals should be entitled to 
        the benefits of citizenship or residency.

SEC. 3. DENIAL OF FEDERAL PUBLIC BENEFITS TO NAZI PERSECUTORS.

    (a) In General.--The following paragraphs shall apply 
notwithstanding any other provision of law:
            (1) Social security benefits.--A participant in Nazi 
        persecution is not eligible for any benefit under sections 202 
        or 223 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402; 423).
            (2) Supplemental security income benefits.--A participant 
        in Nazi persecution is not eligible for any benefit under title 
        XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.), 
        including any supplemental payment pursuant to an agreement for 
        Federal administration under section 1616(a) of such Act (42

        to citizenship has been revoked under section 340 of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act in any case in which such 
        revocation is based on conduct described in section 
        212(a)(3)(E)(i) of such Act (relating to participation in Nazi 
        persecution); or
            (2) who has lost status as a national of the United States 
        by voluntary renunciation under section 349(a)(5) of the
