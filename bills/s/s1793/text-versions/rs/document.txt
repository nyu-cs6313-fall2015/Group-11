<DELETED>    Congress finds the following:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas

        carbon monoxide can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, a 
        serious health condition that could result in death.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from 
        motor vehicles and the abnormal operation of fuel-burning 
        appliances, such as furnaces, water heaters, portable 
        generators, and stoves, in residential homes and other dwelling 
        units kills more than 400 people each year and sends more than 
        20,000 to hospital emergency rooms for treatment.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) Research shows that purchasing and installing 
        carbon monoxide alarms close to the sleeping areas in

        fatalities.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) Congress should promote the purchase and 
        installation of carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes and 
        dwelling units nationwide in order to promote the health and
