&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 19. AMERICAN SAMOA CITIZENSHIP PLEBISCITE ACT.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the 
``American Samoa Citizenship Plebiscite Act''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Findings and Purpose.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Findings.--Congress finds the 
        following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) Under the Immigration and Nationality 
                Act, persons born in Puerto Rico, Guam, the United 
                States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the 
                Northern Mariana Islands are citizens of the United 
                States at birth. Persons born in the United States 
                territory of American Samoa are nationals of the United 
                States, but not citizens, at birth.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) The term ``national of the United 
                States'' is defined under the Immigration and 
                Nationality Act to include persons who, though not 
                citizens of the United States, owe permanent allegiance 
                to the United States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) For more than 100 years, American 
                Samoans who are United States nationals have 
                demonstrated their loyalty and allegiance to the United 
                States. On April 17, 1900, the village chiefs of 
                Tutuila and Aunu'u ceded their islands to the United 
                States. On July 16, 1904, his Majesty King Tuimanu'a of 
                the Manu'a Islands and his village chiefs did the same. 
                On February 20, 1929, the United States Congress 
                officially ratified the Treaty of Cession of Tutuila 
                and Aunu'u and the Treaty of Cession of Manu'a. On 
                March 4, 1925, by Joint Resolution of the United States 
                Congress, American sovereignty was officially extended 
                over Swains Island and it was placed under the 
                jurisdiction of the government of American 
                Samoa.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) Since ratification of the Treaties of 
                Cession, many American Samoans who are United States 
                nationals have joined the United States Armed Forces 
                and fought for the United States during World War II, 
                the Korean, Vietnam, and Persian Gulf wars, and most 
                recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) It is the responsibility of the 
                Secretary of Interior to advance the economic, social 
                and political development of the territories of the 
                United States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to 
        provide for a federally authorized vote in American Samoa on 
        the question of citizenship and if a majority of voters vote 
        for citizenship, to describe the steps that the President and 
        Congress shall take to enable American Samoans to be granted 
        citizenship.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Citizenship Vote.--The Secretary of Interior shall 
direct the American Samoa Election Office to conduct a plebiscite on 
the issue of whether persons born in American Samoa desire United 
States citizenship.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``As United States Citizens:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) Individuals born in American Samoa 
                would be United States citizens by Federal 
                law.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) All persons living in American Samoa 
                who are United States nationals will become United 
                States citizens. Persons born in American Samoa will no 
                longer be United States nationals.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;Do you want persons born in American Samoa to become 
        United States citizens? Yes &lt;/DELETED&gt;__ 
        &lt;DELETED&gt;No&lt;/DELETED&gt;__&lt;DELETED&gt;?''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 20. ELIGIBILITY FOR MARINE TURTLE CONSERVATION 
              ASSISTANCE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The Marine Turtle Conservation Act of 2004 is amended--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) in each of sections 2(b) and 3(2) (16 U.S.C. 
        6601(b), 6602(2)), by inserting ``and territories of the United 
        States'' after ``foreign countries'' each place it 
        appears;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) in section 3 (16 U.S.C. 6602), by adding at 
        the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(7) Territory of the united states.--The term 
        `territory of the United States' means each of the several 
        States of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, 
        Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
        Islands, and any other territory or possession of the United 
        States.''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) in section 4(b)(1)(A) (16 U.S.C. 
        6603(b)(1)(A)), by inserting ``or territory of the United 
        States'' after ``foreign country''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
