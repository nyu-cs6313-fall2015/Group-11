SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Coal Country Protection Act'' or the 
``Protecting Jobs, Families, and the Economy From EPA Overreach Act''.

SEC. 2. REGULATION OF EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE FROM NEW OR EXISTING 
              POWER PLANTS.

    (a) Limitation on Regulation.--The Clean Air Act is amended by 
inserting after section 312 (42 U.S.C. 7612) the following:

``SEC. 313. LIMITATION ON REGULATION OF EMISSIONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE 
              FROM NEW OR EXISTING POWER PLANTS.

    ``(a) Definition of New or Existing Power Plant.--In this section, 
the term `new or existing power plant' means a fossil fuel-fired power 
plant that commences operation at any time.
    ``(b) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law 
(including regulations), the Administrator may not promulgate any 
regulation or guidance that limits or prohibits any new carbon dioxide 
emissions from a new or existing power plant, and no such regulation or 
guidance shall have any force or effect, until the date on which--
            ``(1) the Secretary of Labor certifies to the Administrator 
        that the regulation or guidance will not generate any loss of 
        employment;
            ``(2) the Director of the Congressional Budget Office 
        certifies to the Administrator that the regulation or guidance 
        will not result in any loss in the gross domestic product of 
        the United States;
            ``(3) the Administrator of the Energy Information 
        Administration certifies to the Administrator that the 
        regulation or guidance will not generate any increase in 
        electricity rates in the United States; and
            ``(4) the Chairperson of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
        Commission and the President of the North American Electric 
        Reliability Corporation certify to the Administrator the 
        reliability of electricity delivery under the regulation or 
        guidance.''.
