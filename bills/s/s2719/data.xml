  <summary>7/31/2014--Introduced.
Manufacturing Universities Act of 2014 - Authorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish a program to designate up to 25 institutions of higher education as U.S. manufacturing universities that are to be awarded funds over a four-year period.

Requires an institution applying for such program to submit a plan describing its engineering programs, its relationship to manufacturing industries, and its ability to positively impact local and regional economic development.

Requires NIST to recommend adaptations to certain Small Business Act programs to assist small businesses that collaborate with such universities.</summary>
