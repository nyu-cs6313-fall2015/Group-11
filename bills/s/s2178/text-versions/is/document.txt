        due notice'';
            (2) by inserting after ``with respect thereto.'' the 
        following: ``An appropriate hearing shall be one that is non-
        adversarial with the hearing officer charged, in collaboration 
        with the parties, with the responsibility of identifying any 
        relevant and material pre-election issues and thereafter making 
        a full record thereon. Relevant and material pre-election 
        issues shall include, in addition to unit appropriateness, the 
        Board's jurisdiction and any other issue the resolution of 
        which may reasonably be expected to impact the outcome of the 
        election. Parties may independently raise any relevant and 
        material pre-election issue or assert any relevant and material 
        position at any time prior to the close of the hearing.'';

        petition. The Board shall certify the results of the election 
        after it has ruled on each pre-election issue not resolved 
        before the election and any additional issue pertaining to the 
        conduct or results of the election''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following: ``Not earlier than 
        7 days after a final determination by the Board of the 
        appropriate bargaining unit, the Board shall acquire from the 
        employer a list of all employees eligible to vote in the 
        election to be made available to all parties, which shall 
        include the names of the employees, and one additional form of 
        personal contact information of the employee (such as telephone 
        number, email address, or mailing address) chosen by the 
        employee in writing.''.
