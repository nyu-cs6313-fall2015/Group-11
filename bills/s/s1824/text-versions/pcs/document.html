                pipe, pipe or plumbing fitting or fixture, solder, or 
                flux that contains brass that is not lead free if--
                            ``(i) a supplier of water owns the brass 
                        before the date of enactment of this 
                        subparagraph;
                            ``(ii) the brass is used to prevent or

                                    ``(II) an interruption in service 
                                of a public water system; and
                            ``(iii) the supplier of water is otherwise 
                        in compliance with (as of the date on which the 
                        brass is used) all laws (including 
                        regulations), except any monitoring

            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(5) Finding of unreasonable risk to public health.--The 
        exemption in paragraph (4)(C) shall not apply to a municipality 
        if the Administrator finds that the exemption, as applied to 
        the municipality or all municipalities, would result in an 
        unreasonable risk to public health.''.

        Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.); and
            (2) request the Council to consider sources of lead 
        throughout drinking water distribution systems, including 
        through components used to reroute drinking water during 
        distribution system repairs.
