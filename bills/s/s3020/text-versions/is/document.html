  To establish the composition known as America the Beautiful as the 
                            national anthem.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. NATIONAL ANTHEM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) America the Beautiful is an anthem that far better 
        represents the scope and majesty of the geography of the United 
        States of America as well as the principles of freedom, 
        liberty, fraternity, and progress that are the unifying beliefs 
        of our democracy.
            (2) America the Beautiful enshrines the sacrifice of those 
        who have given their lives to create and preserve our 
        democracy.
            (3) America the Beautiful should replace the Star-Spangled 
        Banner as the national anthem.
    (b) Amendment.--Section 301(a) of title 36, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:
    ``(a) Designation.--The composition consisting of the words and 
music known as America the Beautiful is the national anthem.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
