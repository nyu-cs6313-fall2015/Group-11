    (b) Phased Transfers.--Transfers of project-based assistance under 
this section may be done in phases to accommodate the financing and 
other requirements related to rehabilitating or constructing the 
project or projects to which the assistance is transferred, to ensure

    (c) The transfer authorized in subsection (a) is subject to the 
following conditions:
            (1) Number and bedroom size of units.--
                    (A) For occupied units in the transferring project:

                receiving project or projects.
                    (B) For unoccupied units in the transferring 
                project: the Secretary may authorize a reduction in the 
                number of dwelling units in the receiving project or 
                projects to allow for a reconfiguration of bedroom 
                sizes to meet current market demands, as determined by 
                the Secretary and provided there is no increase in the 
                project-based assistance budget authority.
            (2) The transferring project shall, as determined by the 
        Secretary, be either physically obsolete or economically 
        nonviable.
            (3) The receiving project or projects shall meet or exceed 
        applicable physical standards established by the Secretary.
            (4) The owner or mortgagor of the transferring project

        transferring project and provide a certification of approval by 
        all appropriate local governmental officials.
            (5) The tenants of the transferring project who remain 
        eligible for assistance to be provided by the receiving project 
        or projects shall not be required to vacate their units in the

        receiving project are available for occupancy.
            (6) The Secretary determines that this transfer is in the 
        best interest of the tenants.
            (7) If either the transferring project or the receiving 
        project or projects meets the condition specified in subsection 
        (d)(2)(A), any lien on the receiving project resulting from 
        additional financing obtained by the owner shall be subordinate 
        to any FHA-insured mortgage lien transferred to, or placed on, 
        such project by the Secretary, except that the Secretary may 
        waive this requirement upon determination that such a waiver is 
        necessary to facilitate the financing of acquisition, 
        construction, and/or rehabilitation of the receiving project or 
        projects.
            (8) If the transferring project meets the requirements of 
        subsection (d)(2), the owner or mortgagor of the receiving 
        project or projects shall execute and record either a 
        continuation of the existing use agreement or a new use 
        agreement for the project where, in either case, any use 
        restrictions in such agreement are of no lesser duration than 
        the existing use restrictions.
            (9) The transfer does not increase the cost (as defined in 
        section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as 
        amended) of any FHA-insured mortgage, except to the extent that 
        appropriations are provided in advance for the amount of any 
        such increased cost.

States Housing Act of 1937 or other Federal programs, the Secretary 
shall maintain any rental assistance payments under section 8 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 and other programs that are attached 
to any dwelling units in the property. To the extent the Secretary 
determines, in consultation with the tenants and the local government, 
that such a multifamily property owned or held by the Secretary is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 
or other programs, based on consideration of (1) the costs of 
rehabilitating and operating the property and all available Federal, 
State, and local resources, including rent adjustments under section 
524 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 
1997 (``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be 
remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in 
consultation with the tenants of that property, contract for project-

existing housing properties, or provide other rental assistance. The 
Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that project-
based contracts remain in effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the 
exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of 
tenants for imminent major threats to health and safety after written 
notice to and informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other 
available remedies, such as partial abatements or receivership. After 
disposition of any multifamily property described under this section, 
the contract and allowable rent levels on such properties shall be 
subject to the requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.
    Sec. 217.  Section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act 
of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5308) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a) by inserting ``States on behalf of 
        non-entitlement communities,'' after ``issued by eligible 
        public entities,'';
            (2) by striking subsection (k) and inserting the following:
    ``(k) The Secretary shall monitor the use by eligible public 
entities and States of commitment amounts authorized in appropriation 
Acts for any fiscal year. If the Secretary finds that 50 percent of the 
annual commitment amount has been committed, the Secretary may impose a 
limitation on the amount of guarantees any one entity may receive in 
any fiscal year of $35,000,000 for units of general local government 
receiving grants under section 106(b) or States receiving grants under 
section 106(d) and $7,000,000 for units of general local government 
receiving grants under section 106(d); or request the enactment of

forth above. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation 
with the tenants and the local government, that the property is not 
feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such section 8

existing housing properties, or provide other rental assistance. The 
Secretary shall report semi-annually on all properties covered by this

        conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties and 
        termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have 
        such conditions multiple times; and

        Development is taking to protect tenants of such identified 
        properties.

Provided, That in addition, $50,000,000 shall be made available until 
expended to the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for mortgage

conditions:
            (1) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (``NRC'') 
        shall make grants to counseling intermediaries approved by the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (with match 
        to be determined by the NRC based on affordability and the 
        economic conditions of an area; a match also may be waived by 
        the NRC based on the aforementioned conditions) to provide 
        mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance primarily to States 
        and areas with high rates of defaults and foreclosures to help 
        eliminate the default and foreclosure of mortgages of owner-
        occupied single-family homes that are at risk of such 
        foreclosure. Other than areas with high rates of defaults and 
        foreclosures, grants may also be provided to approved 
        counseling intermediaries based on a geographic analysis of the 
        United States by the NRC which determines where there is a 
        prevalence of mortgages that are risky and likely to fail, 
        including any trends for mortgages that are likely to default 
        and face foreclosure. A State Housing Finance Agency may also 
        be eligible where the State Housing Finance Agency meets all 
        the requirements under this paragraph. A HUD-approved 
        counseling intermediary shall meet certain mortgage foreclosure 
        mitigation assistance counseling requirements, as determined by 
        the NRC, and shall be approved by HUD or the NRC as meeting 
        these requirements.
            (2) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance shall only 
        be made available to homeowners of owner-occupied homes with 
        mortgages in default or in danger of default. These mortgages 
        shall likely be subject to a foreclosure action and homeowners 
        will be provided such assistance that shall consist of 
        activities that are likely to prevent foreclosures and result 
        in the long-term affordability of the mortgage retained 
        pursuant to such activity or another positive outcome for the 
        homeowner. No funds made available under this paragraph may be 
        provided directly to lenders or homeowners to discharge 
        outstanding mortgage balances or for any other direct debt 
        reduction payments.
            (3) The use of mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance 
        by approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing Finance 
        Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the borrower's 
        financial situation, an evaluation of the current value of the 
        property that is subject to the mortgage, counseling regarding 
        the assumption of the mortgage by another non-Federal party, 
        counseling regarding the possible purchase of the mortgage by a 
        non-Federal third party, counseling and advice of all likely 
        restructuring and refinancing strategies or the approval of a 
        work-out strategy by all interested parties.
            (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds 
        under this paragraph to its own charter members with expertise 
        in foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a 
        certification by the NRC that the procedures for selection do 
        not consist of any procedures or activities that could be 
        construed as a conflict of interest or have the appearance of 
        impropriety.
            (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing 
        Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall 
        have demonstrated experience in successfully working with 
        financial institutions as well as borrowers facing default, 
        delinquency, and foreclosure, as well as documented counseling 
        capacity, outreach capacity, past successful performance and 
        positive outcomes with documented counseling plans (including 
        post mortgage foreclosure mitigation counseling), loan workout 
        agreements, and loan modification agreements. NRC may use other 
        criteria to demonstrate capacity in underserved areas.
            (6) Of the total amount made available under this 
        paragraph, up to $2,500,000 may be made available to build the 
        mortgage foreclosure and default mitigation counseling capacity 
        of counseling intermediaries through NRC training courses with 
        HUD-approved counseling intermediaries and their partners, 
        except that private financial institutions that participate in 
        NRC training shall pay market rates for such training.
            (7) Of the total amount made available under this 
        paragraph, up to 5 percent may be used for associated 
        administrative expenses for the NRC to carry out activities 
        provided under this section.
            (8) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance grants may 
        include a budget for outreach and advertising, and training, as 
        determined by the NRC.
            (9) The NRC shall continue to report bi-annually to the 
        House and Senate Committees on Appropriations as well as the 
        Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee 
        on its efforts to mitigate mortgage default.
