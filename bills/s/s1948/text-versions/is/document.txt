                                 A BILL


 
To promote the academic achievement of American Indian, Alaska Native, 
    and Native Hawaiian children with the establishment of a Native 
                    American language grant program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Native Language Immersion Student 
Achievement Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress established the unique status of Native 
        American languages and distinctive policies supporting their 
        use as a medium of education in the Native American Languages 
        Act (Public Law 101-477).
            (2) Reports from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal, 
        public, charter, and private schools and colleges that use 
        primarily Native American languages to deliver education, have 
        indicated that students from these schools have generally had 
        high school graduation and college attendance rates above the 
        norm for their peers.
            (3) The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 
        U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) includes policy barriers to schools taught 
        through Native American languages and a lack of adequate 
        funding to support such opportunities.
            (4) There is a critical need that requires immediate action 
        to support education through Native American languages to 
        preserve these languages.

SEC. 3. NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE SCHOOLS.

    Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:
