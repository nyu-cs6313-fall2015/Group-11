       To improve master plans for major military installations.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Military Installations Enhancement 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense is one of the largest Federal 
        holders of real estate, with a global portfolio covering more 
        than 27,700,000 acres.
            (2) The Department of Defense maintains more than 5,000 
        military sites, with 122 sites considered major military 
        installations, each valued at more than $1,794,000,000 in 
        fiscal year 2013 dollars.
            (3) The Department of Defense is working to maximize range 
        and training areas on its military installations in an effort 
        to promote military readiness.
            (4) The Department of Defense is committed to ensuring that 
        it is delivering cost-effective, safe, and environmentally 
        sound capabilities and capacities to support the national 
        defense mission.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) military installations are a critical component of the 
        United States force capabilities;
            (2) military installations should be developed to preserve 
        or expand range and training areas on bases in order to enhance 
        military readiness;
            (3) military installations create communities of identity 
        for servicemembers and their families, and are important to 
        overall wellness and quality of life;
            (4) the Department of Defense should take into 
        consideration opportunities to reduce military construction 
        costs on installations through cost-effective construction and 
        planning; and
            (5) the Department of Defense and Congress should endeavor 
        to promote quality of life for servicemembers and military 
        families living on military installations.
