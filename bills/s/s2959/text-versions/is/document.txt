SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) was 
        enacted to provide health care and modest benefits to coal 
        miners who develop pneumoconiosis (referred to in this section 
        as ``black lung disease'') resulting from exposure to coal dust 
        during their employment. Yet the determination of a claimant's 
        eligibility for these benefits often requires complex, 
        adversarial litigation. Resource disparities between coal 
        companies and such claimants are widespread within the 
        statutory and regulatory framework of such Act. Comprehensive 
        reforms are necessary to ensure that coal miners are not at a 
        disadvantage when filing claims for benefits.
            (2) The Government Accountability Office has found that 
        many claimants under the Black Lung Benefits Act are not 
        equipped with the medical and legal resources necessary to 
        develop evidence to meet the requirements for benefits. Miners 
        often lack complete and reliable medical evidence, consequently 
        increasing the risk that the individuals who review claims for 
        benefits will be presented with insufficient medical evidence. 
        Similarly, without better options for legal representation, 
        significant numbers of such claimants proceed with their claims 
        through a complex and potentially long administrative process 
        without resources that Department of Labor officials and black 
        lung disease experts note are important for developing evidence 
        and supporting their claims. Only a quarter of claimants are 
        represented by an attorney when filing a claim. Absent efforts 
        to remedy administrative problems and address structural 
        weaknesses in the process for obtaining benefits, claimants 
        with meritorious claims would not receive benefits.
            (3) Full exchange and disclosure between the parties of 
        relevant medical information is essential for fair adjudication 
        of claims under the Black Lung Benefits Act, regardless of 
        whether the parties intend to submit such information into 
        evidence. Records of adjudications reveal that some mine 
        operators' legal representatives have withheld relevant 
        evidence from claimants, administrative law judges, and, in 
        some cases, even their own medical experts. In several cases, 
        the disclosure of such evidence would have substantiated a 
        miner's claim for benefits. Withholding medical information can 
        endanger miners by depriving them of important information 
        about their own health and the potential need to seek medical 
        treatment.
            (4) Given the remedial nature of the Black Lung Benefits 
        Act, when an adjudicator determines that evidence is evenly 
        balanced, it is appropriate for any resulting doubt to be 
        resolved in favor of the claimant. The Supreme Court vacated 
        this longstanding legal principle, not on substantive grounds, 
        but because its application conflicted with the requirements of 
        another statute. Such principle needs to be reinstated in the 
        Black Lung Benefits Act because it provides fairness and 
        improves the administration of benefits.
            (5) Physicians who read lung x-rays as part of pulmonary 
        assessments used in proceedings for claims under the Black Lung 
        Benefits Act are required to demonstrate competency in 
        classifying chest radiographs by becoming certified as B 
        Readers by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
        Health (referred to in this section as ``NIOSH''). However, 
        investigations have uncovered that there are NIOSH-certified B 
        Readers who have systematically misclassified chest radiographs 
        while employed by coal operators or their law firms for the 
        purpose of opposing claims under such Act. In response, the 
        Department of Labor has directed claims examiners not to credit 
        negative chest x-ray readings for pneumoconiosis by one widely 
        used physician employed at a prominent medical center, unless 
        the Secretary of Labor determines that such readings are 
        otherwise credible. Where chest radiographs are needed to 
        establish entitlement to benefits, claimants should have access 
        to accurate interpretations so as to ensure the fair 
        adjudication of such claims.
            (6) As of the date of enactment of this Act, more than one 
        year has passed since survivors were denied benefits on claims 
        under the Black Lung Benefits Act that involved the 
        consideration of chest radiograph interpretations by a certain 
        physician whose interpretations have since been determined by 
        the Department of Labor to be generally not worthy of credit. 
        Such survivors should be permitted to file a new claim for 
        benefits under such Act. However, a survivor is effectively 
        barred from filing a new claim one year after a decision 
        regarding such benefits is final, constituting an injustice 
        that merits a remedy.
            (7) Between the calendar years 2004 and 2014, a reduction 
        in the number of administrative law judges in the Department of 
        Labor, coupled with a large increase in the number of cases 
        filed under the Black Lung Benefits Act, cuts to nondefense 
        discretionary spending, furloughs resulting from sequestration, 
        and the 16-day shutdown of the Federal Government during the 
        calendar year 2013, has created extensive delays in 
        adjudicating claims under such Act and numerous other labor and 
        employment laws. Due to the imbalance between resources and 
        caseloads, it takes 429 days to assign a case to an 
        administrative law judge and a typical claim under such Act 
        remains unresolved for an average of 42 months prior to a 
        decision by an administrative law judge. These delays directly 
        and severely impact the lives of workers throughout the United 
        States, placing an undue financial and emotional burden on the 
        affected individuals and their families.
            (8) Contrary to the intent of Congress, benefits payments 
        under the Black Lung Benefits Act do not automatically increase 
        with the rising cost of living. Benefit payments are tied to 
        the monthly pay rate for Federal employees in grade GS-2, step 
        1. In several of the fiscal years prior to the enactment of 
        this Act, there was a pay freeze for Federal employees, which 
        eliminated cost-of-living adjustments under such Act for such 
        years.
            (9) A competent assessment of medical information and 
        testimony, which often involves multiple physicians disputing a 
        diagnosis, is necessary in determining whether to award 
        benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act. To ensure that a 
        determination regarding a claim for benefits under such Act is 
        fair and accurate, regular training is needed regarding--
                    (A) developments in pulmonary medicine relating to 
                black lung disease;
                    (B) medical evidence necessary to sustain claims 
                for such benefits; and
                    (C) the proper weight to be given to conflicting 
                evidence.
            (10) Black lung disease has been the underlying or 
        contributing cause of death of more than 76,000 miners since 
        1968. After decades of decline, the incidence of coal miners 
        with black lung disease is on the rise. According to NIOSH, 
        miners are developing advanced cases of the disease at younger 
        ages. In response, the Department of Labor has taken important 
        steps to combat the disease, including promulgating a rule that 
        reduces the allowed concentration of coal dust and eliminates 
        weaknesses in the current dust sampling system. Retrospective 
        studies should be continued to determine whether revisions to 
        the standards are necessary to eliminate the disease.

SEC. 102. LEGAL FEES.

    Part A of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 901 et seq.), as 
amended by section 101, is further amended by adding at the end the 
following:

``SEC. 404. ATTORNEYS' FEE PAYMENT PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Program Established.--
            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
        of enactment of the Black Lung Benefits Improvement Act of 
        2014, the Secretary shall establish an attorneys' fee payment 
        program to pay attorneys' fees, using amounts from the fund, to 
        the attorneys of claimants in qualifying claims.
            ``(2) Qualifying claim.--A qualifying claim for purposes of 
        this section is a contested claim for benefits under this title 
        for which a final order has not been entered within one year of 
        the filing of the claim.
            ``(3) Use of payments from the fund.--Notwithstanding any 
        other provision of law, amounts in the fund shall be available 
        for payments authorized by the Secretary under this section.

            ``(1) In general.--If a claimant for benefits under this 
        title obtains an effective award for a qualifying claim before 
        an administrative law judge, the Benefits Review Board 
        established under section 21(b) of the Longshore and Harbor 
        Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 921(b)), or a Federal 
        court, and the judge, Board, or court approves attorneys' fees 
        for work done before it, the Secretary shall, through the 
        program under this section, pay an amount of attorneys' fees 
        not to exceed $1,500 at each stage of the administrative and 
        legal process.
            ``(2) Maximum.--The program established under this section 
        shall not pay more than a total of $4,500 in attorneys' fees 
        for any single qualifying claim.
    ``(c) Reimbursement of Funds.--In any case in which a qualifying 
claim results in a final order awarding compensation, the liable 
operator shall reimburse the fund for any fees paid under this section, 
subject to enforcement by the Secretary under section 424 and in the

the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 921(d)).
    ``(d) Additional Program Rules.--Nothing in this section shall 
limit or otherwise affect an operator's liability for any attorneys'

Secretary's authority to use amounts in the fund to pay approved 
attorneys' fees in claims for benefits under this title for which a 
final order awarding compensation has been entered and the operator is 
unable to pay.
    ``(e) No Recoupment of Attorneys' Fees.--Any payment for attorneys' 
fees made by the Secretary under this section shall not be recouped

SEC. 103. CLARIFYING ELIGIBILITY FOR BLACK LUNG BENEFITS CLAIMS.

    Section 411(c) of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921(c)) is 
amended by striking paragraphs (3) and (4) and inserting the following:
            ``(3)(A) If x-ray, biopsy, autopsy, or other medically 
        accepted and relevant test or procedure establishes that a 
        miner is suffering or has suffered from a chronic dust disease 
        of the lung, diagnosed as complicated pneumoconiosis or 
        progressive massive fibrosis, then there shall be an 
        irrebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled 
        due to pneumoconiosis, that such miner's death was due to 
        pneumoconiosis, or that, at the time of death, such miner was 
        totally disabled by pneumoconiosis, as the case may be. A chest 
        radiograph that yields one or more large opacities (greater 
        than one centimeter in diameter) and would be classified in 
        category A, B, or C in the International Classification of 
        Radiographs of Pneumoconioses by the International Labor 
        Organization shall be sufficient to invoke such presumption, 
        unless there is more probative evidence establishing that the 
        etiology of a large opacity is not pneumoconiosis.
            ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `complicated 
        pneumoconiosis or progressive massive fibrosis' means 
        pneumoconiosis that has formed an opacity, mass, or lesion 
        greater than one centimeter in diameter.
            ``(4) If a miner was employed for 15 years or more in one 
        or more coal mines, and if there is a chest radiograph 
        submitted in connection with the claim under this title of such 
        miner or such miner's surviving spouse, child, parent, brother, 
        sister, or dependent and it is interpreted as negative with 
        respect to the requirements of paragraph (3), and if other 
        evidence demonstrates the existence of a totally disabling 
        respiratory or pulmonary impairment, then there shall be a 
        rebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due 
        to pneumoconiosis, that the miner's death was due to 
        pneumoconiosis, or that, at the time of death, the miner was 
        totally disabled by pneumoconiosis. In the case of a living 
        miner, a spouse's affidavit may not be used by itself to 
        establish the presumption under this paragraph. The presumption 
        under this paragraph may be rebutted only by establishing that 
        such miner does not, or did not, have pneumoconiosis, or that 
        no part of such miner's respiratory or pulmonary impairment was 
        caused by pneumoconiosis.''.

SEC. 104. RESTORING ADEQUATE BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS FOR MINERS SUFFERING 
              FROM BLACK LUNG DISEASE AND FOR THEIR DEPENDENT FAMILY 
              MEMBERS.

    Section 412(a) of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 922(a)) is 
amended by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:
            ``(1) In the case of total disability of a miner due to 
        pneumoconiosis, the disabled miner shall be paid benefits 
        during the disability--
                    ``(A) for any calendar year preceding January 1, 
                2015, at a rate equal to 37\1/2\ per centum of the 
                monthly pay rate for Federal employees in grade GS-2, 
                step 1;
                    ``(B) for the calendar year beginning on January 1, 
                2015, at a rate of $7,980 per year, payable in 12 equal 
                monthly payments; and
                    ``(C) for each calendar year thereafter, at a rate 
                equal to the amount under subparagraph (B) increased by 
                an amount equal to any increase in the annual rate of 
                the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and 
                Clerical Workers, as published by the Bureau of Labor 
                Statistics.''.

SEC. 105. TREATMENT OF EVIDENCE IN EQUIPOISE.

    Section 422 of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 932) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(m) In determining the validity of a claim under this title, an 
adjudicator who finds that the evidence is evenly balanced on an issue 
shall resolve any resulting doubt in the claimant's favor and find that 
the claimant has met the burden of persuasion on such issue.''.

SEC. 106. PROVIDING ASSISTANCE WITH CLAIMS FOR MINERS AND THEIR 
              DEPENDENT FAMILY MEMBERS.

    Section 427(a) of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 937(a)) is 
amended by striking ``the analysis, examination, and treatment'' and 
all that follows through ``coal miners.'' and inserting ``the analysis, 
examination, and treatment of respiratory and pulmonary impairments in 
active and inactive coal miners and for assistance on behalf of miners, 
surviving spouses, dependents, and other family members with claims 
arising under this title.''.

SEC. 107. FALSE STATEMENTS OR MISREPRESENTATIONS, ATTORNEY 
              DISQUALIFICATION, AND DISCOVERY SANCTIONS.

    Section 431 of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 941) is 
amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 431. FALSE STATEMENTS OR MISREPRESENTATIONS, ATTORNEY 
              DISQUALIFICATION, AND DISCOVERY SANCTIONS.

    ``(a) In General.--No person, including any claimant, physician,

evidence under this section shall be paid for by the fund. If a 
claimant receives a final award of benefits, the operator liable for 
payment of benefits, if any, shall reimburse the fund for such

        negative for pneumoconiosis or complicated pneumoconiosis or 
        progressive massive fibrosis by a physician with respect to 
        whom the Secretary of Labor has directed, in writing and after 
        an evaluation by such Secretary, that such physician's negative 
        interpretations of chest radiographs not be credited, unless 
        otherwise determined credible by such Secretary, in evaluating 
        a claim for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 
        U.S.C. 901 et seq.).
            (3) Covered individual.--The term ``covered individual'' 
        means an individual whose record for a claim for benefits under 
        the Black Lung Benefits Act includes a covered chest 
        radiograph.
            (4) Covered survivor.--The term ``covered survivor'' means 
        an individual who--
                    (A) is a survivor of a covered individual whose 
                claim under the Black Lung Benefits Act was still 
                pending at the time of the covered individual's death; 
                and
                    (B) who continued to seek an award with respect to 
                the covered individual's claim after the covered 
                individual's death.
            (5) Pneumoconiosis.--The term ``pneumoconiosis'' has the 
        meaning given the term in section 402(b) of the Black Lung 
        Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 902(b)).
    (b) Claims.--A covered individual or a covered survivor whose claim 
for benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act was denied prior to the 
enactment of this Act may file a new claim for benefits under this Act 
not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act.
    (c) Adjudication on the Merits.--
            (1) In general.--Any new claim filed under subsection (b) 
        shall be adjudicated on the merits and shall not include 
        consideration of a covered chest radiograph.
            (2) Covered survivor.--Any new claim filed under subsection 
        (b) by a covered survivor shall be adjudicated as either a 
        miner's or a survivor's claim depending upon the type of claim 
        pending at the time of the covered individual's death.
    (d) Time of Payment.--
            (1) Miner's claim.--If a claim, filed under subsection (b) 
        and adjudicated under subsection (c) as a miner's claim, 
        results in an award of benefits, benefits shall be payable 
        beginning with the month of the filing of the denied claim that 
        had included in its record a covered chest radiograph.
            (2) Survivor's claim.--If a claim, filed under subsection 
        (b) and adjudicated under subsection (c) as a survivor's claim, 
        results in an award of benefits, benefits shall be payable 
        beginning with the month of the miner's death.
    (e) Contributing Impact.--The Secretary of Labor shall have the 
discretion to deny a new claim under subsection (b) in circumstances 
where the party opposing such claim establishes through clear and 
convincing evidence that a covered chest radiograph did not contribute 
to the decision to deny benefits in all prior claims filed by the 
covered individual or the covered survivor.
    (f) Limitation on Filing of New Claims.--A new claim for benefits 
may be filed under subsection (b) only if the original claim was 
finally denied by a district director, an administrative law judge, or 
the Benefits Review Board established under section 21(b) of the 
Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 921(b)).

SEC. 113. STRATEGY TO REDUCE DELAYS IN ADJUDICATION.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall submit to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions and the Committee on 
Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee on Education and the 
Workforce and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of 
Representatives a comprehensive strategy to reduce the backlog of cases

Law Judges of the Department of Labor.
    (b) Contents of Strategy.--The strategy under this section shall 
provide information relating to--
            (1) the current and targeted pendency for each category of 
        cases before the Office of Administrative Law Judges of the 
        Department of Labor;
            (2) the number of administrative law judges, attorney 
        advisors supporting such judges, support staff, and other 
        resources necessary to achieve and maintain the targeted 
        pendency for each category of such cases;
            (3) the necessary resources to improve efficiency and 
        effectiveness, such as equipment for video conferences, 
        training, use of reemployed annuitants, and administrative 
        reforms;
            (4) the impact of sequestration, furloughs, and the Federal 
        Government shutdown, which occurred from October 1 to October 
        16, 2013, on increasing administrative burdens and the backlog 
        of cases pending before such office; and
            (5) with respect to claims filed under the Black Lung 
        Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 901 et seq.), the necessary resources 
        needed to reduce the average pendency of cases to less than 12 
        months from the date of receipt of the case to the date of 
        disposition of such case.
    (c) Consultation.--In preparing such strategy, the Secretary of 
Labor shall consult with organizations that have ongoing interactions 
with the Office of Administrative Law Judges of the Department of 
Labor, including organizations that represent parties in cases under 
the Black Lung Benefits Act, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' 
Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 901 et seq.), and Federal statutes 
regarding whistleblowers, wages and hours for employees, and 
immigration.

House of Representatives a report on any barriers to health care faced 
by coal miners with pneumoconiosis.
    (b) Contents.--The report required under subsection (a) shall 
include--
            (1) an assessment of possible barriers to health care under 
        the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) and the 
        degree to which any barriers impact the ability of miners with 
        legitimate medical needs, particularly such miners in rural 
        areas, to access treatment for pneumoconiosis;
            (2) recommendations necessary to address issues, if any, 
        relating to patient access to care under such Act; and
            (3) an evaluation of whether the benefit payments 
        authorized under such Act, as amended by this Act, are 
        sufficient to meet the expenses of disabled miners, surviving 
        spouses, dependents, and other family members entitled to 
        receive benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act.

        the health of miners, or that the incidence of pneumoconiosis 
        among coal miners in the United States, as reported by the 
        National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, has not 
        been reduced from such incidence prior to the implementation of 
        the most recent applicable standard for respirable dust 
        concentration, the Secretary shall, consistent with the 
        requirements of this section and section 101, accordingly 
        revise such standard and any applicable sampling or testing 
        procedures not later than 24 months after the publication of
