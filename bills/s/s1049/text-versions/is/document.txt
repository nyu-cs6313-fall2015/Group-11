            (4) the Federal Employee Compensation Act shall not apply 
        to an eligible organization or eligible individual conducting 
        good Samaritan search-and-recovery mission under this section 
        and such activities shall not constitute civilian employment.
    (b) Release of the Federal Government From Liability.--The 
Secretary shall not require an eligible organization or an eligible 
individual to have liability insurance as a condition of accessing 
Federal lands under this section if the eligible organization or 
eligible individual--

        provisions listed in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection 
        (a); and

                for the request to be approved.
    (d) Partnerships.--The Secretary shall develop search-and-recovery 
focused partnerships with search-and-recovery organizations to--
            (1) coordinate good Samaritan search-and-recovery missions 
        on Federal lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the 
        Secretary; and
            (2) expedite and accelerate good Samaritan search-and-
        recovery mission efforts for missing individuals on Federal
