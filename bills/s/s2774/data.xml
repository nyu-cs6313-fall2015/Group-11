  <summary>8/1/2014--Introduced.
Boating Capacity Standards Act of 2013 - Directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to: (1) establish standards for determining the maximum passenger capacity for recreational vessels, expressed in the number of passengers and in pounds; (2) require manufacturers and operators of passenger vessels to permanently display such maximum capacity in a legible manner that is clearly visible to passengers; and (3) require operators to post notice of the need to balance vessel weight to avoid capsizing.

Defines a "recreational vehicle" as any vessel that is manufactured or used primarily for pleasure, excluding any vessel that is subject to Coast Guard inspection and engaged in commercial use.</summary>
