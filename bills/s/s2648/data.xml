Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2014 - Appropriates supplemental funds for FY2014 to specified federal agencies and programs to respond to the increased apprehensions of unaccompanied children and minors along the southwestern border, fight wildfires, and support Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system.

Provides appropriations for the Department of Justice (DOJ); the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); and the Department of State to cover necessary expenses to respond to the significant rise in unaccompanied children and adults with children at the southwest border.

Provides appropriations for the U.S Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Forest Service to cover anticipated wildfire suppression funding shortfalls if funds previously provided for wildfire suppression will be exhausted imminently and USDA notifies the appropriations committees of the need for additional funds.

Amends the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to require certain adjustments to discretionary spending limits for FY2015-FY2021 for wildfire suppression operations in the wildland fire management accounts at the Department of the Interior and the USDA.

Provides appropriations for the Department of Defense (DOD) to assist the government of Israel with procurement of the Iron Dome defense system to counter short-range rocket threats.
