                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from enforcing the Patient 
 Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education 
                      Reconciliation Act of 2010.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On May 10, 2013, the Internal Revenue Service admitted 
        that it singled out advocacy groups, based on ideology, seeking 
        tax-exempt status.
            (2) This action raises pertinent questions about the 
        agency's ability to implement and oversee the Patient 
        Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) and the 
        Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public 
        Law 111-152).
            (3) This action could be an indication of future Internal 
        Revenue Service abuses in relation to the Patient Protection 
        and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education 
        Reconciliation Act of 2010, given that it is their 
        responsibility to enforce a key provision, the individual 
        mandate.
            (4) Americans accept the principle that patients, families, 
        and doctors should be making medical decisions, not the Federal 
        Government.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITING ENFORCEMENT OF PPACA AND HCERA.

    The Secretary of the Treasury, or any delegate of the Secretary, 
shall not implement or enforce any provisions of or amendments made by 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) or 
the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 
111-152).
                                                       Calendar No. 137
