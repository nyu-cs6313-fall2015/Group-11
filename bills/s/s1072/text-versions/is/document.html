                                 A BILL


 
To ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration advances the safety 
    of small airplanes and the continued development of the general 
               aviation industry, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Airplane Revitalization Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A healthy small aircraft industry is integral to 
        economic growth and to maintaining an effective transportation 
        infrastructure for communities and countries around the world.
            (2) Small airplanes comprise nearly 90 percent of general 
        aviation aircraft certified by the Federal Aviation 
        Administration.
            (3) General aviation provides for the cultivation of a 
        workforce of engineers, manufacturing and maintenance 
        professionals, and pilots who secure the economic success and 
        defense of the United States.
            (4) General aviation contributes to well-paying jobs in the 
        manufacturing and technology sectors in the United States and 
        products produced by those sectors are exported in great 
        numbers.
            (5) Technology developed and proven in general aviation 
        aids in the success and safety of all sectors of aviation and 
        scientific competence.
            (6) The average small airplane in the United States is now 
        40 years old and the regulatory barriers to bringing new 
        designs to the market are resulting in a lack of innovation and 
        investment in small airplane design.
            (7) Since 2003, the United States lost 10,000 active 
        private pilots per year on average, partially due to a lack of 
        cost-effective, new small airplanes.
            (8) General aviation safety can be improved by modernizing 
        and revamping the regulations relating to small airplanes to 
        clear the path for technology adoption and cost-effective means 
        to retrofit the existing fleet with new safety technologies.

SEC. 3. SAFETY AND REGULATORY IMPROVEMENTS FOR GENERAL AVIATION.

    (a) In General.--Not later than December 15, 2015, the 
Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall issue a 
final rule--
            (1) to advance the safety and continued development of 
        small airplanes by reorganizing the certification requirements 
        for such airplanes under part 23 to streamline the approval of 
        safety advancements; and
            (2) that meets the objectives described in subsection (b).
    (b) Objectives Described.--The objectives described in this 
subsection are the following objectives of the Part 23 Reorganization 
Aviation Rulemaking Committee:

        airplanes that will improve safety and decrease certification 
        costs.
            (2) The establishment of broad, outcome-driven safety 
        objectives that will spur innovation and technology adoption.
            (3) The replacement of current, prescriptive requirements 
        under part 23 with performance-based regulations.
            (4) The use of consensus standards accepted by the Federal 
        Aviation Administration to clarify how the safety objectives of 
        part 23 may be met using specific designs and technologies.
    (c) Consensus-Based Standards.--In prescribing regulations under 
this section, the Administrator shall use consensus standards, as 
described in section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act of 1996 (15 U.S.C. 272 note), to the extent practicable 
while continuing to evaluate traditional methods for meeting the 
objectives of part 23.
