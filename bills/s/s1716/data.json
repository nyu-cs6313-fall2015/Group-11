Requires infrastructure projects assisted under this Act to have costs that are reasonably anticipated to equal or exceed $50 million ($10 million for rural infrastructure projects).\n\nSets forth special requirements for infrastructure projects in rural areas. Establishes an Office of Technical and Rural Assistance to provide technical assistance to state and local governments and parties in public-private partnerships in the development and financing of eligible infrastructure projects, including rural infrastructure projects.\n\nEstablishes an Office of Special Inspector General to conduct, supervise, and coordinate audits and investigations of the business activities of IFA.\n\nProhibits financial assistance from IFA for any private project for which no public benefit is created. Sets forth terms for loans or loan guarantees for eligible infrastructure projects and for the repayment of such loans. Requires an annual independent audit of IFA finances.\n\nRequires the Chief Executive Officer of IFA to: (1) establish fees with respect to loans and loan guarantees that are sufficient to cover IFA's administrative costs; and (2) take actions to make IFA a self-sustaining entity, with administrative and federal credit subsidy costs fully funded by fees and risk premiums on loans and loan guarantees."
