SEC. 201. PERFORMANCE BASED HOME ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 
is amended by adding at the end the following new section:

``SEC. 25E. PERFORMANCE BASED ENERGY IMPROVEMENTS.

    ``(a) In General.--In the case of an individual, there shall be 
allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the 
taxable year for a qualified whole home energy efficiency retrofit an 
amount determined under subsection (b).
    ``(b) Amount Determined.--
            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (4), the amount 
        determined under this subsection is equal to--

        base amount is $2,000, but only if the energy use for the 
        residence is reduced by at least 20 percent below the baseline 
        energy use for such residence as calculated according to 
        paragraph (5).
            ``(3) Increase amount.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), 
        the amount determined under this paragraph is $500 for each 
        additional 5 percentage point reduction in energy use.

        under this subsection exceed the lesser of--

        of this subsection--
                    ``(A) In general.--The reduction in energy use for 
                any residence shall be determined by modeling the 
                annual predicted percentage reduction in total energy 
                costs for heating, cooling, hot water, and permanent 
                lighting. It shall be modeled using computer modeling 
                software approved under subsection (d)(2) and a 
                baseline energy use calculated according to subsection

                type shall be determined by dividing the total actual 
                energy bill for the residence for that fuel type for 
                the most recent available 12-month period by the total 
                energy units of that fuel type used over the same 
                period.
