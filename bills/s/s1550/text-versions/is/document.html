  To amend title 10, United States Code, to require the Secretary of 
  Defense to use only human-based methods for training members of the 
        Armed Forces in the treatment of severe combat injuries.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Battlefield Excellence through 
Superior Training Practices Act'' or ``BEST Practices Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense has made impressive strides 
        in the development and use of methods of medical training and 
        troop protection, such as the use of tourniquets and 
        improvements in body armor, that have led to decreased 
        battlefield fatalities.
            (2) The Department of Defense uses more than 6,000 live 
        animals each year to train physicians, medics, corpsmen, and 
        other personnel methods of responding to severe battlefield 
        injuries.
            (3) The civilian sector has almost exclusively phased in 
        the use of superior human-based training methods for numerous 
        medical procedures currently taught in military courses using 
        animals.
            (4) Human-based medical training methods such as simulators 
        replicate human anatomy and can allow for repetitive practice 
        and data collection.
            (5) According to scientific, peer-reviewed literature, 
        medical simulation increases patient safety and decreases 
        errors by healthcare providers.
            (6) The Army Research, Development and Engineering Command 
        and other entities of the Department of Defense have made 
        impressive strides in the development of methods for the 
        replacement of live animal-based training.
            (7) According to the report by the Department of Defense 
        titled ``Final Report on the use of Live Animals in Medical 
        Education and Training Joint Analysis Team'' published on July 
        12, 2009--
                    (A) validated, high-fidelity simulators will be 
                available for nearly every high-volume or high-value 
                battlefield medical procedure by the end of 2011, and 
                many were available as of 2009; and
                    (B) validated, high-fidelity simulators will be 
                available to teach all other procedures to respond to 
                common battlefield injuries by 2014.

SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO USE HUMAN-BASED METHODS FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL 
              TRAINING.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 101 of title 10, United States Code, is

    ``(a) Combat Trauma Injuries.--(1) Not later than October 1, 2016, 
the Secretary of Defense shall develop, test, and validate human-based 
training methods for the purpose of training members of the armed 
forces in the treatment of combat trauma injuries with the goal of 
replacing live animal-based training methods.
    ``(2) Not later than October 1, 2018, the Secretary--
            ``(A) shall only use human-based training methods for the

    ``(b) Exception for Particular Commands and Training Methods.--(1) 
The Secretary may exempt a particular command, particular training 
method, or both, from the requirement for human-based training methods

training methods will not provide an educationally equivalent or 
superior substitute for live animal-based training methods for such 
command or training method, as the case may be.
    ``(2) Any exemption under this subsection shall be for such period, 
not more than one year, as the Secretary shall specify in granting the 
exemption. Any exemption may be renewed (subject to the preceding 
sentence).
    ``(c) Annual Reports.--(1) Not later than October 1, 2014, and each
