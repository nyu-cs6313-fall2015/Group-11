        needs of the employing agency; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to ensure U.S. Customs and Border Protection

                exceed the limitation established under section 5547 in 
                the period in which it was earned.''.
            (2) Minimization of overtime.--U.S. Customs and Border

                requirements at each Border Patrol duty station;
                    (B) estimates the cost of the staffing requirements

                            (i) a position-by-position review at each 
                        Border Patrol station to determine--
                                    (I) the duties assigned to each 
                                position;
                                    (II) how the duties relate to the 
                                operational requirements of U.S. Border 
                                Patrol; and
                                    (III) the number of hours border 
                                patrol agents in that position would 
                                need to work each pay period to meet 
                                the operational requirements of U.S. 
                                Border Patrol;
                            (ii) the metrics used to determine the 
                        number of hours of work performed at each 
                        Border Patrol station, broken down by the type 
                        of hours worked;
                            (iii) a cost analysis of the most recent 
                        full fiscal year by the type of full-time 
                        equivalent hours worked;
                            (iv) a cost estimate by the type of full-
                        time equivalent hours expected to be worked 
                        during the first full fiscal year after the 
                        date of enactment of this Act; and
                            (v) an analysis that compares the cost of 
                        assigning the full-time equivalent hours needed 
                        to meet the operational requirements of U.S. 
                        Border Patrol to existing border patrol agents 
                        through higher rates of pay versus recruiting,
