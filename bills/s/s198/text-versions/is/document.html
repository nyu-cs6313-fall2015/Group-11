                                 A BILL


 
   To require a report on the designation of Boko Haram as a foreign 
            terrorist organization, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Boko Haram Terrorist Designation Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF BOKO HARAM AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST 
              ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On August 26, 2011, a vehicle borne explosive device 
        (VBIED) was detonated after being driven into the lobby of a 
        United Nations facility in Abuja, Nigeria. At least 21 people 
        died as a result of the explosion, and the Islamist militant 
        organization commonly called ``Boko Haram'' claimed 
        responsibility.
            (2) On December 25, 2011, a series of bombs were detonated 
        across northern Nigeria. Some of these attacks killed 
        worshippers attending Christmas Day services, and killed an 
        estimated total of 41 people. Boko Haram claimed 
        responsibility.
            (3) From their inception, Boko Haram has killed hundreds of 
        innocent civilians and has continually enhanced its lethality, 
        pledging to continue its use of terrorist tactics. In a July 
        2010 statement, Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, issued 
        support to al Qaeda and made threatening remarks to the United 
        States.
            (4) On January 31, 2012, in testimony before Congress, 
        Director of National Intelligence James Clapper included Boko 
        Haram in his worldwide threat assessment, stating, ``There are 
        also fears that Boko Haram--elements of which have engaged al-
        Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM)--is interested in hitting 
        Western targets, such as the U.S. Embassy and hotels frequented 
        by Westerners.''.
            (5) On February 23, 2012, United States Ambassador to 
        Nigeria Terrence P. McCulley indicated Boko Haram's danger was 
        expanding. He said, ``We've seen an increase in sophistication, 
        we've seen increased lethality. We saw at last a part of the 
        group has decided it's in their interest to attack the 
        international community.''.
            (6) On February 27, 2012, at a conference held by the 
        African Society of the National Summit on Africa, former United 
        States Ambassador to Nigeria Howard F. Jeter described Boko 
        Haram by saying, ``It is a terrorist group. If you kill 28 
        innocent people worshipping in a church, it is a terrorist 
        group.''.
            (7) The Foreign Office of the United Kingdom of Great 
        Britain and Northern Ireland, a major United States ally, 
        publicly refers to Boko Haram as the ``main terrorist threat in 
        Nigeria''.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall, in 
        consultation with the intelligence community, submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees--
                    (A) a detailed report on whether the Nigerian 
                organization named ``People Committed to the 
                Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad'' 
                (commonly known as ``Boko Haram'' and by other aliases, 
                including Ansaru and Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati 
                Wal-Jihad), meets the criteria for designation as a 
                foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of the 
                Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189); and
                    (B) if the Secretary of State determines that Boko 
                Haram does not meet such criteria, a detailed 
                justification as to which criteria have not been met.
            (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified 
        annex if appropriate.
            (3) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                    (A) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term 
                ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
                            (i) the Committee on Homeland Security and 
                        Governmental Affairs, the Committee on Armed 
                        Services, the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
                        and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the 
                        Senate; and
                            (ii) the Committee on Homeland Security, 
                        the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee 
                        on Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select 
                        Committee on Intelligence of the House of 
                        Representatives.
                    (B) Intelligence community.--The term 
                ``intelligence community'' has the meaning given that 
                term in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 
                1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a(4)).

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that Boko Haram meets the criteria for 
designation as a foreign terrorist organization under section 219 of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189) and should be 
designated as such.

SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    Nothing in this Act may be construed to infringe upon the 
sovereignty of the Government of Nigeria to combat militant or 
terrorist groups operating inside the boundaries of Nigeria.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
