    "text": "Creating Quality Technical Educators Act of 2014 - Amends title II (Teacher Quality Enhancement) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize grants under the Teacher Quality Partnership grant program to be used for secondary school career and technical education teacher preparation programs. (The grant program provides funds to partnerships of high-need local educational agencies [LEAs], high-need schools or early education programs, and institutions of higher education [IHEs] to train current and prospective teachers and school leaders.)\n\nRequires the career and technical education teacher preparation programs to:\n\n be available to mid-career professionals or recent graduates of an IHE who have expertise in a program area in which there is a career and technical education teacher shortage; allow individuals to obtain initial licensure and the basic skills required for entry into the education profession, with the option of earning a bachelor's or master's degree; and allow teachers who do not have subject matter expertise in a career and technical education field that is in demand in the local or regional economy to receive the technical skills training they need to teach those skills in a classroom setting. Requires each partnership to select program participants based on the career and technical education program needs of any high-need LEAs in the partnership.\n\nRequires each program participant to undergo specified pre-classroom training that is followed by: (1) mentoring from an experienced teacher for at least two years, and (2) continuing professional development coursework over the course of three years.\n\nRequires program participants to: (1) be provided a one-year living stipend or salary while they undergo preservice training, and (2) serve as a full-time career and technical education teacher in a high-need LEA in the partnership for at least three academic years immediately after their successful completion of the pre-classroom training.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Education to establish performance measures for the career and technical education teacher preparation programs."
