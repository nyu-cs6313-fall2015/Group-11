        the Treasury shall issue a debt limit warning to the Committee 
        on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of 
        the House of Representatives that shall include a determination 
        as to when extraordinary measures may be necessary in order to 
        prolong the funding of the United States Government.

                    ``(A) Extraordinary measures.--The term 
                `extraordinary measures' means measures that may be 
                taken by the Secretary of the Treasury in the event of 
                a breach of the debt limit by the United States to 
                prolong the function of United States Government in the 
                absence of a debt limit increase.
                    ``(B) Near breach.--The term `near breach' means 
                the point at which the Secretary of the Treasury 
                determines that the United States Government will reach 
                the statutorily prescribed debt limit within 60 
                calendar days notwithstanding the implementation of 
                extraordinary measures.

        reduce spending over the sum of the current and following 10 
        years by an amount equal to or greater than the amount of the 
        requested debt limit increase. Net interest savings may not be 
        counted towards spending reductions required by this paragraph.
            ``(2) Calculation.--The spending savings under paragraph 
        (1) shall be calculated against a budget baseline consistent 
        with section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
        Control Act of 1985. This baseline shall exclude the 
        extrapolation of any spending that had been enacted under an

        statutory debt limit unless the bill contains net spending 
        reductions of an equal or greater amount over the sum of the

                proposed spending reductions under paragraph (1) shall 
                be calculated by the Congressional Budget Office

                shifts outlays or revenues from within the 10-year 
                window to outside the window shall not count towards 
                the budget savings target for purposes of this 
                subsection.
    ``(b) Senate Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--
