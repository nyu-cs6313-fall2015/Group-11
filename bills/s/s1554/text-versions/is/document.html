    (a) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, and annually thereafter, each head of a Federal public land 
management agency shall make available to the public on the website of 
the Federal public land management agency a report that includes--
            (1) a list of the location and acreage of land more than 
        640 acres in size under the jurisdiction of the Federal public 
        land management agency on which the public is allowed, under 
        Federal or State law, to hunt, fish, or use the land for other 
        recreational purposes--
                    (A) to which there is no public access or egress; 
                or
                    (B) to which public access or egress to the legal 
                boundaries of the land is significantly restricted (as

                management agency);
            (2) with respect to land described in paragraph (1), a list 
        of the locations and acreage on the land that the head of the

        significant potential for use for hunting, fishing, and other 
        recreational purposes; and
            (3) with respect to land described in paragraph (2), a plan 
        developed by the Federal public land management agency that--

                reasonably be provided to the legal boundaries of the 
                land in a manner that minimizes the impact on wildlife 
                habitat and water quality;
                    (B) specifies the actions recommended to secure the 
                access and egress, including acquiring an easement, 
                right-of-way, or fee title from a willing owner of any 
                land that abuts the land or the need to coordinate with 
                State land management agencies or other Federal or 
                State governmental entities to allow for such access 
                and egress; and

                in effect on the land.
    (b) List of Public Access Routes for Certain Land.--Not later than 
1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, each head of a Federal 
public land management agency shall make available to the public on the

revise as the head of the Federal public land management agency 
determines appropriate, a list of roads or trails that provide the 
primary public access and egress to the legal boundaries of contiguous 
parcels of land equal to more than 640 acres in size under the 
jurisdiction of the Federal public land management agency on which the 
public is allowed, under Federal or State law, to hunt, fish, or use 
the land for other recreational purposes.
    (c) Means of Public Access and Egress Included.--In considering 
public access and egress under subsections (a) and (b), the head of the 
applicable Federal public land management agency shall consider public 
access and egress to the legal boundaries of the land described in

            (2) on foot or horseback.
    (d) Effect.--
            (1) In general.--This Act shall have no effect on whether a 
        particular recreational use shall be allowed on the land 
        described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a).
            (2) Effect of allowable uses on agency consideration.--In 
        preparing the plan under subsection (a)(3), the head of the 
        applicable Federal public land management agency shall only 
        consider recreational uses that are allowed on the land at the 
        time that the plan is prepared.
