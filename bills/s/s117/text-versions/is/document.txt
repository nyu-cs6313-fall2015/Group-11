SEC. 2. NEGOTIATION OF LOWER COVERED PART D DRUG PRICES ON BEHALF OF 
              MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.

    (a) Negotiation by Secretary.--Section 1860D-11 of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-111) is amended by striking subsection 
(i) (relating to noninterference) and inserting the following:
    ``(i) Negotiation of Lower Drug Prices.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, the Secretary shall negotiate with pharmaceutical 
        manufacturers the prices (including discounts, rebates, and 
        other price concessions) that may be charged to PDP sponsors 
        and MA organizations for covered part D drugs for part D 
        eligible individuals who are enrolled under a prescription drug 
        plan or under an MA-PD plan.
            ``(2) No change in rules for formularies.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Nothing in paragraph (1) shall 
                be construed to authorize the Secretary to establish or 
                require a particular formulary.
                    ``(B) Construction.--Subparagraph (A) shall not be 
                construed as affecting the Secretary's authority to 
                ensure appropriate and adequate access to covered part 
                D drugs under prescription drug plans and under MA-PD 
                plans, including compliance of such plans with 
                formulary requirements under section 1860D-4(b)(3).
            ``(3) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        construed as preventing the sponsor of a prescription drug 
        plan, or an organization offering an MA-PD plan, from obtaining 
        a discount or reduction of the price for a covered part D drug 
        below the price negotiated under paragraph (1).
            ``(4) Semi-annual reports to congress.--Not later than June 
        1, 2014, and every 6 months thereafter, the Secretary shall 
        submit to the Committees on Ways and Means, Energy and 
        Commerce, and Oversight and Government Reform of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate a 
        report on negotiations conducted by the Secretary to achieve 
        lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries, and the prices and 
        price discounts achieved by the Secretary as a result of such 
        negotiations.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall first 
apply to negotiations and prices for plan years beginning on January 1, 
2014.
