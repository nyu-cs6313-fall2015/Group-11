Global Food Security Act of 2014 - States the policy objective of promoting global food and nutrition security which is reinforced through programs that eradicate hunger and malnutrition, assist foreign countries with agricultural development, and ensure the effective use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to further these objectives.

Requires the Administrator to coordinate the efforts of federal departments and agencies in the implementation of the strategy by: (1) establishing policy coherence, monitoring, and evaluation systems across all relevant U.S. agencies; (2) establishing linkages with other initiatives and strategies at USAID and other departments and agencies; (3) establishing platforms for regular consultation and collaboration with key stakeholders; (4) leveraging the expertise of the Department of Agriculture (USDA); and (5) establishing and leading regular public consultations in partner countries.

Requires the Administrator to submit reports to Congress describing the status of the implementation of the Feed the Future Strategy.</summary>
