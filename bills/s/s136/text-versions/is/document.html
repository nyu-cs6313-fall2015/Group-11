``SEC. 45S. ETHICAL STEM CELL RESEARCH.

    ``(a) Allowance of Credit.--For purposes of section 38, in the case 
of an eligible taxpayer, the ethical stem cell research credit 
determined under this section for the taxable year shall be an amount 
equal to 30 percent of the qualified stem cell research expenses paid

    ``(b) Eligible Taxpayer.--For purposes of this section, the term 
`eligible taxpayer' means any taxpayer that elects the application of 
this section for the taxable year.

        expenses' means expenses which are paid or incurred by the 
        eligible taxpayer during the taxable year in carrying on basic 
        and applied research to develop techniques for the isolation, 
        derivation, production, testing, and human clinical use of stem 
        cells that may result in improved understanding of or 
        treatments for diseases and other adverse health conditions, no 
        part of which may involve--
                    ``(A) the creation of a human embryo for research 
                purposes,
                    ``(B) the destruction of or discarding of, or risk
