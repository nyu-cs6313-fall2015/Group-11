    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Chemical Safety and 
Drinking Water Protection Act of 2014''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF SURFACE WATER FROM CONTAMINATION BY 
              CHEMICAL STORAGE FACILITIES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 
300f et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;

 &lt;DELETED&gt;``PART G--PROTECTION OF SURFACE WATER FROM CONTAMINATION BY 
                 CHEMICAL STORAGE FACILITIES&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                chemical storage facility' means a facility at which a 
                chemical is stored and the Administrator or State, as 
                applicable, determines that a release of the chemical 
                from the facility poses a risk of harm to a public 
                water system.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(B) Exclusions.--The term `covered

                requirement for equipment to address hazardous 
                substances pursuant to section 311(j)(1)(C) of the 
                Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.

                applicable, may consider the requirements of applicable 
                Federal or State laws (including 
                regulations).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(2) State program.--The term `State program' 
        means a chemical storage facility source water protection 
        program established under section 1472.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        of chemicals into the water supply in watersheds with public 
        water systems that rely on surface water, including a covered 
        chemical storage facility located in a source water area 
        identified under section 1453.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
