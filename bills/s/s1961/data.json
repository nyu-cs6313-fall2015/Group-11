Defines \"covered chemical storage facility\" as a facility at which a chemical is stored and the Administrator or state determines that a release from the facility poses a risk of harm to a public water system.\n\nDeems a state program and its requirements, for purposes of primary enforcement responsibility, to be part of the national primary drinking water regulations and requires that they be implemented and enforced in accordance with the procedures applicable to such responsibility.\n\nAuthorizes the issuance of orders by the Administrator to carry out this Act.\n\nSets forth requirements concerning: (1) liability of a facility owner or operator for costs of response actions, (2) pre-transfer inspections of facilities, and (3) information for public water systems regarding emergency response plans and chemical inventories.\n\nAuthorizes an owner or operator of a public water system to commence, or to petition the Administrator to commence, a civil action for equitable relief to address possible imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons supplied by the water system. Provides a special rule to expedite the Administrator's response to a petition in emergency situations."
