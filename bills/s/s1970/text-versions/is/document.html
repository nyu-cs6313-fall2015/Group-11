final regulations under which a plan described in section 413(c) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 may be treated as satisfying the 
qualification requirements of section 401(a) of such Code despite the

maintained by such employers.

SEC. 3. MODIFICATION OF ERISA RULES RELATING TO MULTIPLE EMPLOYER 
              DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

        adding at the end the following:
            ``(C)(i) A qualified multiple employer plan shall not fail 
        to be treated as an employee pension benefit plan or pension 
        plan solely because the employers sponsoring the plan share no 
        common interest.
            ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term 
        `qualified multiple employer plan' means a plan described in

                    ``(I) is an individual account plan with respect to 
                which the requirements of clauses (iii), (iv), and (v) 
                are met, and
                    ``(II) includes in its annual report required to be 
                filed under section 104(a) the name and identifying 
                information of each participating employer.
            ``(iii) The requirements of this clause are met if, under 
        the plan, each participating employer retains fiduciary 
        responsibility for--
                    ``(I) the selection and monitoring of the named 
                fiduciary, and

                of the plan's assets attributable to employees of the 
                employer to the extent not otherwise delegated to 
                another fiduciary.
            ``(iv) The requirements of this clause are met if, under 
        the plan, a participating employer is not subject to 
        unreasonable restrictions, fees, or penalties by reason of 
        ceasing participation in, or otherwise transferring assets 
        from, the plan.
            ``(v) The requirements of this clause are met if each 
        participating employer in the plan is an eligible employer as 
        defined in section 408(p)(2)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code 
        of 1986, applied--
                    ``(I) by substituting `500' for `100' in subclause 
                (I) thereof,
                    ``(II) by substituting `5' for `2' each place it 
                appears in subclause (II) thereof, and
                    ``(III) without regard to the last sentence of 
                subclause (II) thereof.''.
            (2) Simplified reporting for small multiple employer 
        plans.--Section 104(a) of such Act (29 U.S.C. 1024(a)) is 
        amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(7)(A) In the case of any eligible small multiple employer plan, 
the Secretary may by regulation--
            ``(i) prescribe simplified summary plan descriptions, 
        annual reports, and pension benefit statements for purposes of 
        section 102, 103, or 105, respectively, and
            ``(ii) waive the requirement under section 103(a)(3) to 
        engage an independent qualified public accountant in cases 
        where the Secretary determines it appropriate.
    ``(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term `eligible small 
multiple employer plan' means, with respect to any plan year--
            ``(i) a qualified multiple employer plan, as defined in 
        section 3(2)(C)(ii), or
            ``(ii) any other plan described in section 413(c) of the 
        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that satisfies the requirements 
        of clause (v) of section 3(2)(C).''.

                given such term in paragraph (13)(C)(iii), any 
                percentage determined under the arrangement if such
