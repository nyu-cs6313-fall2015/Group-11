Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to delay any such rescission for one year if an additional obligation of the earmark is likely to occur during the 10th fiscal year after it was first made available.\n\nRequires each agency head to identify and report every project that is an earmark with an unobligated balance at the end of a fiscal year to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), who shall report a listing and accounting for such earmarks to Congress and to the public via the OMB website."
