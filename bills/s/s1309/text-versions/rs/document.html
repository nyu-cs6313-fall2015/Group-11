reference to lands withdrawn and reserved by this chapter, include the

Secretary may take such action as the Secretary determines necessary or 
desirable to effect and maintain such closure.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

Secretary of the Interior.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

to or use of sacred sites or resources considered important by an 
Indian tribe, the Secretary concerned shall consult, at the earliest 
practicable time, with that tribe.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

chapter will be used for additional defense-related purposes. Such

        involved;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        thereof.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

section may be provided by lease, easement, right-of-way, permit, 
license, or other instrument authorized by law.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

the purpose of preventing drainage of oil or gas resources, the 
Secretary of the Interior may lease lands otherwise withdrawn from

Secretary considers appropriate. No surface occupancy may be approved 
by the Secretary of the Interior without the consent of the Secretary 
concerned. The Secretary of the Interior may unitize or consent to 
communitization of such lands. The Secretary of the Interior may

precautions to prevent, and actions to suppress, brush and range fires 
occurring as a result of military activities on the lands withdrawn and 
reserved by this chapter, including fires outside those lands that 
spread from the withdrawn and reserved lands and which occurred as a 
result of such activities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(b) Cooperation of Secretary of the Interior.--At the 
request of the Secretary concerned, the Secretary of the Interior shall 
provide assistance in the suppression of such fires and shall be 
reimbursed for such assistance by the Secretary concerned. 
Notwithstanding section 2215 of this title, the Secretary concerned may 
transfer to the Secretary of the Interior, in advance, funds to 
reimburse the costs of the Department of the Interior in providing such 
assistance.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

decontamination of contamination caused by defense-related uses on such

concerned.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;``Sec. 2940. Limitation on extensions and renewals&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``The withdrawals and reservations established by this 
chapter may not be extended or renewed except by a law enacted by 
Congress.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;``Sec. 2941. Application for renewal of a withdrawal and 
              reservation&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(a) Notice.--To the extent practicable, no later than 
five years before the termination of a withdrawal and reservation 
established by a subchapter of this chapter, the Secretary concerned 
shall notify the Secretary of the Interior as to whether or not the 
Secretary concerned will have a continuing defense-related need for any 
of the lands withdrawn and reserved by such subchapter after the 
termination date of such withdrawal and reservation. The Secretary 
concerned shall provide a copy of the notice to the Committee on Armed 
Services and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the 
Senate and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Natural 
Resources of the House of Representatives.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(b) Filing for Extension.--If the Secretary concerned 
concludes that there will be a continuing defense-related need for any 
of such lands after the termination date, the Secretary shall file an 
application for extension of the withdrawal and reservation of such 
needed lands in accordance with the regulations and procedures of the 
Department of the Interior applicable to the extension of 
withdrawals.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;``Sec. 2942. Limitation on subsequent availability of lands 
              for appropriation&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``At the time of termination of a withdrawal and 
reservation made by a subchapter of this chapter, the previously 
withdrawn lands shall not be open to any form of appropriation under 
the public land laws, including the mining laws and the mineral leasing 
and geothermal leasing laws, until the Secretary of the Interior 
publishes in the Federal Register an appropriate order specifying the 
date upon which such lands shall be restored to the public domain and 
opened for such purposes.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;``Sec. 2943. Relinquishment&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(a) Notice of Intention To Relinquish.--If, during the 
period of withdrawal and reservation, the Secretary concerned decides 
to relinquish any or all of the lands withdrawn and reserved by a 
subchapter of this chapter, the Secretary concerned shall file a notice 
of intention to relinquish with the Secretary of the 
Interior.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(b) Determination of Contamination.--As a part of the 
notice under subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall include a 
written determination concerning whether and to what extent the lands 
that are to be relinquished are contaminated with explosive materials 
or toxic or hazardous substances.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(c) Public Notice.--The Secretary of the Interior shall 
publish in the Federal Register the notice of intention to relinquish, 
including the determination concerning the contaminated state of the 
lands.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(d) Decontamination of Lands To Be Relinquished.--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(1) Decontamination required.--If land subject 
        of a notice of intention to relinquish pursuant to subsection 
        (a) is contaminated, and the Secretary of the Interior, in 
        consultation with the Secretary concerned, determines that 
        decontamination is practicable and economically feasible 
        (taking into consideration the potential future use and value 
        of the land) and that, upon decontamination, the land could be 
        opened to operation of some or all of the public land laws, 
        including the mining laws and the mineral leasing and 
        geothermal leasing laws, the Secretary concerned shall 
        decontaminate the land to the extent that funds are 
        appropriated for such purpose.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(2) Alternatives.--If the Secretary of the 
        Interior, after consultation with the Secretary concerned, 
        concludes that decontamination of land subject of a notice of 
        intention to relinquish pursuant to subsection (a) is not 
        practicable or economically feasible, or that the land cannot 
        be decontaminated sufficiently to be opened to operation of 
        some or all of the public land laws, or if Congress does not 
        appropriate sufficient funds for the decontamination of such 
        land, the Secretary of the Interior shall not be required to 
        accept the land proposed for relinquishment.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(3) Status of contaminated lands upon 
        termination.--If, because of their contaminated state, the 
        Secretary of the Interior declines to accept the lands 
        withdrawn and reserved by a subchapter of this chapter which 
        have been proposed for relinquishment, or if at the expiration 
        of the withdrawal and reservation made by such subchapter the 
        Secretary of the Interior determines that some of the lands 
        withdrawn and reserved by such subchapter are contaminated to 
        an extent which prevents opening such contaminated lands to 
        operation of the public land laws--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) the Secretary concerned shall take 
                appropriate steps to warn the public of the 
                contaminated state of such lands and any risks 
                associated with entry onto such lands;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                withdrawal and reservation, the Secretary concerned

                connection with decontamination of such lands; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(C) the Secretary concerned shall report 
                to the Secretary of the Interior and to the Congress 
                concerning the status of such lands and all actions 
                taken in furtherance of this paragraph.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(e) Revocation Authority.--Upon deciding that it is in 
the public interest to accept the lands proposed for relinquishment 
pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary of the Interior may order the 
revocation of a withdrawal and reservation established by a subchapter 
of this chapter as it applies to such lands. The Secretary of the 
Interior shall publish in the Federal Register the revocation order, 
which shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(1) terminate the withdrawal and 
        reservation;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        by the Secretary of the Interior; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        opened to the operation of some or all of the public land laws, 
        including the mining laws.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

this section shall be construed to require the Secretary of the 
Interior to accept the lands proposed for relinquishment if the 
Secretary determines that such lands are not suitable for return to the 
public domain. If the Secretary makes such a determination, the 
Secretary shall provide notice of the determination to 
Congress.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

              lands&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(a) Authority.--The Secretary of the Interior and the 
Secretary concerned may interchange or transfer between each other 
parcels of Federal land under their jurisdiction. A parcel may include 
multiple non-contiguous pieces of Federal lands.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(b) Conditions.--Any interchange or transfer of land 
under this section is subject to the following conditions:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(1) The Secretary of the Interior and the 
        Secretary concerned must each determine that the interchange or

        reservation established by this Act.
            (2) Revocation order.--To carry out a revocation under

    (f) Acceptance by Secretary of the Interior.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in this section requires the 
        Secretary of the Interior to accept the land proposed for

        suitable for return to the public domain.
            (2) Notice.--If the Secretary makes a determination that 
        the land is not suitable for return to the public domain, the
