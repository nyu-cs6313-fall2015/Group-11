 delivery team for authorized civil works flood control and navigation 
            construction projects of the Corps of Engineers.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Corps of Engineers Project Delivery 
Flexibility Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Army, acting through the 
Chief of Engineers, shall establish a pilot program to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness and project delivery efficiency of non-Federal 
sponsors as the lead project delivery team for authorized civil works 
flood control and navigation construction projects of the Corps of 
Engineers.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the pilot program are--
            (1) to identify project delivery and cost-saving 
        alternatives that reduce the backlog of Corps of Engineers 
        construction projects;
            (2) to evaluate the technical, financial, and 
        organizational efficiencies of a non-Federal sponsor operating 
        as the lead project manager for the design, execution, 
        management, and construction of a project; and
            (3) to evaluate alternatives for the decentralization of 
        the project planning, management, and operational 
        decisionmaking process of the Corps of Engineers.
    (c) Administration.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), in carrying out 
        the pilot program, the Secretary of the Army shall--
                    (A) identify not less than 12 congressionally 
                authorized flood control and navigation construction 
                projects of the Corps of Engineers that--
                            (i) have received Federal funds and have 
                        experienced delays or missed scheduled 
                        deadlines in the 5 fiscal years prior to the 
                        date of enactment of this Act;
                            (ii) have an unobligated funding balance in 
                        the Corps of Engineers Construction Account; 
                        and
                            (iii) include levees, floodwalls, flood 
                        control channels, water control structures, or 
                        navigation locks and channels;
                    (B) enter into a project partnership agreement with 
                the non-Federal sponsor for the non-Federal sponsor to 
                provide full project management control for the design 
                and construction of the flood control or navigation 
                project, including preconstruction engineering and 
                design, project implementation, and construction 
                activities; and
                    (C) in consultation with the district engineer and 
                the non-Federal sponsor, develop a detailed project 
                management plan for each project under the pilot 
                program that outlines the scope, budget, design, and 
                construction resource requirements necessary for 
                execution of the project by the non-Federal sponsor.
            (2) Restrictions.--
                    (A) In general.--A flood control or navigation 
                project shall only receive Federal funding under this 
                Act if the project is federally owned.
                    (B) Project delivery team.--As a condition of 
                receiving amounts under this Act, the non-Federal

                local project stakeholders, shall establish to oversee 
                the execution of the project management plan a project 
                delivery team, which shall, at a minimum, consist of--
                            (i) a project manager; and

                        shall provide technical assistance and guidance 
                        on compliance with Corps of Engineers 
                        engineering manuals and regulations.
            (3) Technical assistance.--On the request of the non-
        Federal sponsor and in consultation with other appropriate 
        Federal agencies, the Secretary of the Army shall provide the 
        non-Federal sponsor with any necessary technical assistance, 
        including assistance relating to Federal acquisition 
        regulations, contracting requirements, and environmental
