            (1) Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary 
        of the Treasury shall adopt final regulations providing that a 
        plan may, but is not required to, consolidate two or more of 
        the notices required under sections 404(c)(5)(B) and 514(e)(3) 
        of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29

        with the frequency required for each such notice.
            (2) The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of the 
        Treasury may include in such regulations rules to ensure that, 
        to the extent such notices are consolidated with the summary 
        plan description or summary of material modifications, the 
        presentation, placement, or prominence of the information in 
        such notices shall not have the effect of failing to inform 
        participants and beneficiaries regarding the information in 
        such notices.

        period before such plan year, provide to each participant to 
        whom the arrangement applies for such plan year'' and inserting

        employee becomes eligible, and thereafter within a reasonable 
        period before each plan year during which such arrangement 
        applies,''.

    Not later than six months after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Labor shall modify the regulations under section 404 
of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to provide that, 
in the case of a designated investment alternative that contains a mix 
of asset classes, a plan administrator may, but is not required to, use 
a benchmark that is a blend of different broad-based securities market 
indices if--
            (1) the blend is reasonably representative of the asset 
        class holdings of the designated investment alternative;
            (2) for purposes of determining the blend's returns for 1-, 
        5-, and 10-calendar year periods (or for the life of the 
        alternative, if shorter), the blend is modified at least once 
        per year to reflect changes in the asset class holdings of the 
        designated investment alternative; and
            (3) each securities market index that is used for an 
        associated asset class would separately satisfy the 
        requirements of such regulations for such asset class.

compliance in such other means as the Secretary deems appropriate.
    (b) Loan Error.--
            (1) In the case of plan loan errors for which corrections 
        are specified under the voluntary compliance program, self-
        correction shall be made available by methods applicable to 
        such loans through the voluntary compliance program.
            (2) The Secretary of Labor shall treat any loan error 
        corrected pursuant to paragraph (1) as meeting the requirements 
        of the Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program of the Department 
        of Labor.
    (c) 457(b) Plan Correction.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall 
update the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System to provide the

        distributions to an inherited individual retirement plan 
        described in section 408(d)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code 
        of 1986 in a case where, due to an inadvertent error by a 
        service provider, the beneficiary had reason to believe that 
        the distribution could be rolled over without inclusion in 
        income of any part of the distributed amount.
    (e) Required Minimum Distribution Corrections.--The Secretary of 
the Treasury shall expand the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution 
System to allow plans to which such system applies and custodians of 
individual retirement plans to self-correct, without an excise tax, any 
inadvertent errors pursuant to which a distribution is made no more 
than 180 days after it was required to be made.
    (f) Automatic Feature Error Correction.--In order to promote the 
adoption of automatic enrollment and automatic escalation, the

Resolution System to establish specific correction methods for errors
