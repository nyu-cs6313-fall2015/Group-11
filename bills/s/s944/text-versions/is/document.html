course of education provided by a public institution of higher 
education to a covered individual pursuing a course of education with 
educational assistance under chapter 30 or 33 of this title while 
living in the State in which the public institution of higher education 
is located if the institution charges tuition and fees for that course 
for the covered individual at a rate that is higher than the rate the 
institution charges for tuition and fees for that course for residents 
of the State in which the institution is located, regardless of the 
covered individual's State of residence.
    ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, a covered individual is any 
individual as follows:
            ``(A) A veteran who was discharged or released from a

        individual's relationship to a veteran described in 
        subparagraph (A).
    ``(3) It shall not be grounds to disapprove a course of education 
under paragraph (1) if a public institution of higher education 
requires a covered individual pursuing a course of education at the 
institution to demonstrate an intent to establish residency in the 
State in which the institution is located in order to be charged 
tuition and fees for that course at a rate that is equal to or less 
than the rate the institution charges for tuition and fees for that 
course for residents of the State.
    ``(4) The Secretary may waive such requirements of paragraph (1) as 
the Secretary considers appropriate.
    ``(5) Disapproval under paragraph (1) shall apply only with respect 
to educational assistance under chapters 30 and 33 of this title.''.
