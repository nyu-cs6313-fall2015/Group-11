Defines \"qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property\" as any roof system that: (1) is placed in service above conditioned or semiheated space on an eligible commercial building, (2) has a slope equal to or less than 2:12 (low-slope roof), (3) replaces an existing roof system, and (4) includes insulation meeting specified standards and\u00a0a primary roof covering that has a cool roof surface. Requires the adjustment for depreciation to the earnings and profits of a real estate investment trust for any taxable year, in the case of\u00a0such property, to be determined under the alternative depreciation method, except that the recovery period shall be 20 years."
