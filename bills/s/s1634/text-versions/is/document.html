                chopping, trampling, flattening, burning, or carrying 
                out herbicide treatment.
                    ``(B) Revisions.--A State office may revise a 
                report described in subparagraph (A) as the State 
                office determines to be necessary to reflect changing 
                agricultural practices.''.
