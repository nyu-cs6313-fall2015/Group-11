SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR WEAPON CAPABILITIES OF IRAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Government of Iran continues to expand the nuclear 
        and missile programs of Iran in violation of multiple United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions.
            (2) The Government of Iran has a decades-long track record 
        of violating commitments regarding the nuclear program of Iran 
        and has used diplomatic negotiations as a subterfuge to advance 
        its nuclear weapons program.
            (3) Iran remains the world's foremost state sponsor of 
        terrorism, having directed, supported, and financed acts of 
        terrorism against the United States and its allies that have 
        resulted in the thousands of deaths, including the deaths of 
        United States citizens and members of the Armed Forces of the 
        United States.
            (4) The Government of Iran and its terrorist proxies, 
        particularly Lebanese Hezbollah, continue to provide military 
        and financial support to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in 
        Syria, aiding that regime in the mass killing of the people of 
        Syria.
            (5) The Government of Iran continues to sow instability in 
        the Middle East and threaten its neighbors, including allies of 
        the United States, such as Israel.
            (6) The Government of Iran denies its people fundamental 
        freedoms, including freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, 
        freedom of religion, and freedom of conscience.
            (7) Strict sanctions on Iran, imposed by the United States 
        and the international community, are responsible for bringing 
        Iran to the negotiating table.
            (8) President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has in the past 
        admitted to using diplomatic negotiations to buy time for Iran 
        to make nuclear advances.
            (9) Based on Iran's current stockpile of uranium enriched 
        to 3.5 percent and 20 percent and its current centrifuge 
        capacity, Iran could produce a sufficient quantity of weapons-
        grade uranium for a bomb in one to 2 months' time.
            (10) If the Government of Iran commences the operation of 
        its heavy water reactor in Arak, it could establish an 
        alternate pathway to a nuclear weapon through the production of 
        plutonium.
            (11) As of the date of the enactment of this Act, 19 
        countries access nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without 
        conducting any enrichment or reprocessing activities within 
        those countries.
            (12) The Government of Iran could likewise access nuclear 
        energy for peaceful purposes without conducting any enrichment 
        or reprocessing activities within Iran.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Government of Iran must not be allowed to develop 
        or maintain nuclear weapon capabilities;
            (2) all instruments of power and influence of the United 
        States should remain on the table to prevent the Government of 
        Iran from developing nuclear weapon capabilities;
            (3) the Government of Iran does not have an absolute or 
        inherent right to enrichment and reprocessing capabilities and 
        technologies under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of 
        Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 
        1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as 
        the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');
            (4) the imposition of sanctions under this Act, including 
        sanctions on exports of petroleum from Iran, is triggered by 
        violations by Iran of any interim or final agreement regarding 
        its nuclear program, failure to reach a final agreement in a 
        discernible time frame, or the breach of other conditions 
        described in section 301;
            (5) if the Government of Israel is compelled to take 
        military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran's 
        nuclear weapon program, the United States Government should 
        stand with Israel and provide, in accordance with the law of 
        the United States and the constitutional responsibility of 
        Congress to authorize the use of military force, diplomatic, 
        military, and economic support to the Government of Israel in 
        its defense of its territory, people, and existence;
            (6) the United States should continue to impose sanctions 
        on the Government of Iran and its terrorist proxies for their 
        continuing sponsorship of terrorism; and
            (7) the United States should continue to impose sanctions 
        on the Government of Iran for--
                    (A) its ongoing abuses of human rights; and
                    (B) its actions in support of Bashar al-Assad in 
                Syria.

SEC. 106. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PROSPECTIVE SANCTIONS.

    It is the sense of Congress that, if additional sanctions are 
imposed pursuant to this Act and the Government of Iran continues to 
pursue an illicit nuclear weapons program, Congress should pursue 
additional stringent sanctions on Iran, such as sanctions on entities 
providing the Government of Iran access to assets of the Government of 
Iran held outside Iran, sanctions on Iran's energy sector, including 
its natural gas sector, and sanctions on entities providing certain 
underwriting, insurance, or reinsurance to the Government of Iran.

            (1) the President has been engaged in intensive diplomatic

        Government of Iran to the global financial system;
            (2) the European Union is to be commended for strengthening 
        the multilateral sanctions regime against Iran by prohibiting 
        all persons subject to the jurisdiction of the European Union 
        from providing specialized financial messaging services to the 
        Central Bank of Iran and other sanctioned Iranian financial 
        institutions;
            (3) in order to continue to sharply restrict access by Iran 
        to the global financial system, the President and the European 
        Union must continue to expeditiously address any judicial, 
        administrative, or other decisions in their respective 
        jurisdictions that might weaken the current multilateral 
        sanctions regime, including decisions regarding the designation 
        of financial institutions and global specialized financial 
        messaging service providers for sanctions; and
            (4) existing restrictions on the access of Iran to global 
        specialized financial messaging services should be maintained.

                 TITLE III--IMPLEMENTATION OF SANCTIONS

SEC. 301. SUSPENSION OF SANCTIONS TO FACILITATE A DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION.

    (a) Suspension of New Sanctions.--
            (1) In general.--The President may suspend the application 
        of sanctions imposed under this Act or amendments made by this 
        Act for a 180-day period beginning on the earlier of the date 
        of the enactment of this Act or the date on which the President 
        submits a notification described in paragraph (5) to the 
        appropriate congressional committees, if the President makes 
        the certification described in paragraph (2) to the appropriate 
        congressional committees every 30 days during that period.
            (2) Certification described.--A certification described in 
        this paragraph is a certification that--
                    (A) Iran is complying with the provisions of the 
                Joint Plan of Action and any agreement to implement the 
                Joint Plan of Action;
                    (B) Iran has agreed to specific and verifiable 
                measures to implement the Joint Plan of Action;
                    (C) Iran is transparently, verifiably, and fully 
                implementing the Joint Plan of Action and any agreement 
                to implement the Joint Plan of Action;
                    (D) Iran has not breached the terms of or any 
                commitment made pursuant to the Joint Plan of Action or 
                any agreement to implement the Joint Plan of Action;
                    (E) Iran is proactively and in good faith engaged 
                in negotiations toward a final agreement or arrangement 
                to terminate its illicit nuclear activities, related 
                weaponization activities, and any other nuclear 
                activity not required for a civilian nuclear program;
                    (F) the United States is working toward a final 
                agreement or arrangement that will dismantle Iran's 
                illicit nuclear infrastructure to prevent Iran from 
                achieving a nuclear weapons capability and permit daily 
                verification, monitoring, and inspections of suspect 
                facilities in Iran so that an effort by Iran to produce 
                a nuclear weapon would be quickly detected;
                    (G) any suspension of or relief from sanctions 
                provided to Iran pursuant to the Joint Plan of Action 
                is temporary, reversible, and proportionate to the 
                specific and verifiable measures taken by Iran with 
                respect to terminating its illicit nuclear program and 
                related weaponization activities;
                    (H) Iran has not directly, or through a proxy, 
                supported, financed, planned, or otherwise carried out 
                an act of terrorism against the United States or United 
                States persons or property anywhere in the world;
                    (I) Iran has not conducted any tests for ballistic 
                missiles with a range exceeding 500 kilometers; and
                    (J) the suspension of sanctions is vital to the 
                national security interests of the United States.
            (3) Renewal of suspension.--Following the 180-day period 
        described in paragraph (1), the President may renew a 
        suspension of sanctions under that paragraph for 2 additional 
        periods of not more than 30 days if, for each such renewal, the 
        President submits to the appropriate congressional committees--
                    (A) a certification described in paragraph (2) that 
                covers the 30 days preceding the certification; and
                    (B) a certification that a final agreement or 
                arrangement with Iran to fully and verifiably terminate 
                its illicit nuclear program and related weaponization 
                activities is imminent and that Iran will, pursuant to 
                that agreement or arrangement, dismantle its illicit 
                nuclear infrastructure to preclude a nuclear breakout 
                capability and other capabilities critical to the 
                production of nuclear weapons.
            (4) Termination of suspension of existing sanctions.--
                    (A) In general.--Any sanctions deferred, waived, or 
                otherwise suspended by the President pursuant to the 
                Joint Plan of Action or any agreement to implement the 
                Joint Plan of Action, including sanctions suspended 
                under this section and sanctions relating to precious 
                metals, petrochemicals, Iran's automotive sector, and

                Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (22

                        (3);
                            (ii) Iran breaches its commitments under

                                    (II) the date on which the 
                                President submits a notification 
                                described in paragraph (5) to the 
                                appropriate congressional committees.
            (5) Notification relating to agreement to implement joint 
        plan of action.--Not later than 3 days after Iran has agreed to

        is enacted pursuant to subsection (c), the President may 
        suspend the application of sanctions imposed under this Act or 
        amendments made by this Act for a one-year period if the 
        President certifies to the appropriate congressional committees 
        that the United States and its allies have reached a final and 
        verifiable agreement or arrangement with Iran that will--
                    (A) dismantle Iran's illicit nuclear 
                infrastructure, including enrichment and reprocessing 
                capabilities and facilities, the heavy water reactor 
                and production plant at Arak, and any nuclear weapon 
                components and technology, so that Iran is precluded 
                from a nuclear breakout capability and prevented from 
                pursuing both uranium and plutonium pathways to a 
                nuclear weapon;
                    (B) bring Iran into compliance with all United

                consideration of matters relating to Iran's nuclear 
                program;
                    (C) resolve all issues of past and present concern 
                with the International Atomic Energy Agency, including 
                possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program;
                    (D) permit continuous, around the clock, on-site

                any compliance verification equipment requested by the 
                International Atomic Energy Agency, so that any effort 
                by Iran to produce a nuclear weapon would be quickly 
                detected; and
                    (E) require Iran's full implementation of and 
                compliance with the Agreement between Iran and the 
                International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application

                19, 1973, including modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary 
                Arrangements to that Agreement and ratification and 
                implementation of the Protocol Additional to that 
                Agreement, done at Vienna December 18, 2003; and
                    (F) requires Iran's implementation of measures in 
                addition to the Protocol Additional that include 
                verification by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
                of Iran's centrifuge manufacturing facilities, 
                including raw materials and components, and Iran's 
                uranium mines and mills.
            (2) Renewal of suspension.--The President may renew the 
        suspension of sanctions pursuant to paragraph (1) for 
        additional one-year periods if, for each such renewal, the 
        President--
                    (A) certifies to the appropriate congressional 
                committees that Iran is complying with the terms of the 
                final arrangement or agreement, including by--
                            (i) dismantling Iran's illicit nuclear 
                        infrastructure, including enrichment and 
                        reprocessing capabilities and facilities, and 
                        the heavy water reactor and production plant at 
                        Arak, so that Iran is prevented from pursuing 
                        both uranium and plutonium pathways to a 
                        nuclear weapon;
                            (ii) permitting continuous, around the 
                        clock, on-site inspection, verification, and 
                        monitoring of all suspect facilities in Iran, 
                        including installation and use of any 
                        compliance verification equipment requested by 
                        the International Atomic Energy Agency, so that 
                        any effort by Iran to produce a nuclear weapon 
                        would be quickly detected;
                            (iii) resolving all issues of past and

                        Energy Agency, including possible military

                        United Nations Security Council resolutions 
                        related to Iran's nuclear program, including 
                        Resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006), 1747 
                        (2007), 1803 (2008), 1835 (2008), and 1929

                        Weapons, done at Vienna June 19, 1973, 
                        including modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary

                        2003; and
                            (vi) implementing measures, in addition to 
                        the Protocol Additional, that include 
                        verification by the International Atomic Energy 
                        Agency of Iran's centrifuge manufacturing 
                        facilities, including raw materials and
