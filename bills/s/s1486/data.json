    "text": "Postal Reform Act of 2014 - Title I: Postal Service Workforce - (Sec. 101) Modifies the formula for contributions to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) for postal employees: (1) to require the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to contribute to its employee annuity funds under CSRS and FERS an amount equal to the product of the normal-cost percentage times the aggregate amount of basic pay payable by USPS, for the period involved, to its employees; and (2) in calculating the amounts that it must pay to fund such annuities, to use the demographic factors specific to its employees and appropriate economic assumptions regarding wage and salary trends (rather than using the general characteristics of both postal and non-postal employees combined).\n\nAllows USPS to request and use: (1) up to $6 billion of any funding surplus at the close of FY2013 for payment of its debt obligations; and (2) two-thirds of any funding surplus at the close of FY2014 to reduce unfunded liabilities for retiree health, disability, or worker compensation benefits. Requires the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish an amortization schedule to provide for the liquidation of a postal funding surplus in 40 years.\n\nModifies the schedule under which USPS is required to pay unfunded liabilities under CSRS to require a series of annual payments starting on September 30, 2015, and ending on September 30, 2054.\n\n(Sec. 102) Includes within the scope of any collective bargaining agreement between USPS and postal labor representatives coverage of a new employee (i.e., an individual who becomes an officer or employee of USPS after the enactment of this Act) under FERS and the terms of such coverage.\n\n(Sec. 103) Restructures the pre-funding requirements for USPS retiree health benefits by replacing the current schedule of annual payments to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund with a schedule of annual installment payments that will liquidate pension liabilities by September 30, 2055, or within 15 years, whichever is later, as recomputed by June 30 of each year beginning in 2016. Reduces the pre-funding requirement for retiree health benefits to 80% of projected liability (currently, 100%).\n\n(Sec. 104) Establishes the Postal Service Health Benefits Program (PSHBP) within the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), in which all USPS employees and retirees would participate. Requires Medicare-eligible postal annuitants enrolled in PSHBP to also enroll in Medicare, including parts A, B, & D.\n\n(Sec. 105) Requires any arbitration board deciding a contract dispute between USPS and labor organizations to render a decision not later than 45 days after the date of its appointment and to consider relevant factors, such as the financial condition of USPS.\n\n(Sec. 106) Establishes the Postal Service Workers' Compensation Accrued Liability Fund as a revolving fund to pay the unfunded liability of USPS for workers' compensation payments. Requires USPS, not later than June 30 of 2017 and each year thereafter, to recompute a schedule including a series of annual installments for the liquidation of up to 80% of its unfunded workers' compensation liabilities by the later of September 30, 2057, or September 30 of the year that is 15 years after the fiscal year in which a computation or recomputation is made.\n\nRequires USPS to include in its financial reporting information on its workers compensation obligations, including the amount of its actuarial liability and the value of assets in the Postal Service Workers' Compensation Accrued Liability Fund.\n\n(Sec. 107) Grants the right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to any USPS officer or employer who: (1) is not represented by a recognized bargaining representative; and (2) is in a supervisory, professional, technical, clerical, administrative, or managerial position covered by the Executive and Administrative Schedule.\n\n(Sec. 108) Modifies USPS employment policy to include fringe benefits in any calculation of the pay differentials between\u00a0clerical employees and managers.\n\nTitle II: Postal Service Operations - (Sec. 201) Requires USPS to maintain the service standards for first-class mail and periodicals in effect on October 1, 2013, until the later of two years after the enactment of this Act or one year after the Comptroller General (GAO) reports on USPS delivery times.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to study and report on: (1) how USPS measures delivery times for determining whether service standards have been met, and (2) whether the method used by USPS to measure delivery times reflects the total period between when a mailed item is transferred from a postal customer and arrives at its final destination.\n\nReinstitutes the delivery service standards for first-class mail and periodicals in effect on June 30, 2012, for routes on which such mail was transported under alternate means of transportation contracts.\n\nRequires USPS to report to Congress on potential cost savings resulting from a decision to: (1) transport first-class mail or periodicals on a covered route using a means other than under an alternate means of transportation contract, or (2) discontinue a post office.\n\n(Sec. 202) Prohibits USPS from closing or consolidating any postal facility that was open as of October 1, 2013, until the later of two years after the enactment of this Act or one year after the Comptroller General submits a report on delivery service standards.\n\nRequires USPS, before making a determination as to the necessity for closing or consolidating a postal facility, to conduct an area mail processing study and publish the results on the USPS website.\n\n(Sec. 203) Sets forth procedures and criteria\u00a0to guide USPS in deciding whether to discontinue a post office. Requires USPS, prior to making a determination as to the necessity for the discontinuance of any post office, including a rural post office, to consider alternatives, including: (1) reducing hours of operation, (2) procuring a contract for retail postal services, (3) co-locating retail services with a commercial or governmental entity in the area, (4) providing postal services through a letter carrier or by alternate means of transportation delivery contract, or (5) obtaining an alternative proposal by a local government.\n\nRequires USPS to include in its determination as to whether to discontinue a post office: (1) the effect of the discontinuance on the community served by the post office, on businesses, and on USPS employees; (2) whether the discontinuance would have a significant adverse effect on regular postal services to rural areas, communities, and small towns where post offices are not self-sustaining; (3) whether postal customers lack access to the Internet, broadband, or cellular telephone service; (4) whether postal customers would still have access to essential items, such as prescription drugs and time-sensitive communications; (5) the proximity and accessibility of other post offices; and (6) whether discontinuance would result in substantial economic savings to USPS.\n\nProhibits USPS\u00a0from discontinuing a rural post office for one year after the enactment of this Act. Requires USPS, prior to discontinuing a rural post office, to: (1) determine that its postal customers would continue to receive substantially similar access to essential items; (2) take action to substantially ameliorate any projected reduction in access to such essential items; and (3) determine that there is unlikely to be substantial economic loss to the community served, that the area served by the post office has adequate access to broadband Internet service, and that there is a road with year-round access connecting the community to another post office within 10 miles.\n\nDirects the USPS Inspector General to study and report on the actual cost savings resulting form the discontinuance of a rural post office.\n\nRequires USPS to consider the impact of reducing the number of hours of operation of a post office on local businesses and the community.\n\n(Sec. 204) Authorizes USPS to establish a general, nationwide delivery schedule of five days per week if it determines that such a schedule would contribute to the achievement of long-term solvency and if total mail volume during any period of four consecutive quarters drops below 140 billion pieces. Prohibits USPS from establishing such a delivery schedule before October 1, 2017.\n\nRequires USPS, prior to implementing a five-day delivery schedule, to: (1) identify customers and communities for whom such schedule may have a disproportionate negative impact, including small business customers, the elderly, those who live in locations without access to broadband Internet access, and customers identified as \"particularly affected\" in the Advisory Opinion on Elimination of Saturday Delivery, issued by the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) on March 24, 2011; (2) develop measures to ameliorate any such negative impact; (3) implement measures to increase revenue and reduce costs; (4) evaluate whether any increase in revenue or reduction in costs are sufficient to allow USPS to achieve long-term solvency without implementing a change in delivery schedule; and (5) report to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, PRC, and the Comptroller General on any change in delivery schedule.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General to report on the extent to which a change in delivery schedule would improve the financial condition of USPS and assist in its efforts to achieve long-term solvency. Requires USPS to review and respond to such report.\n\nProvides that nothing in this section shall be construed to: (1) require the decrease or increase in delivery frequency for any route for which USPS provided delivery on fewer than six days per week as of the date of enactment of this Act; (2) require USPS to deliver mail on federal holidays; (3) authorize any change in the days and times that postal retail service or any mail acceptance is available at postal retail facilities or processing facilities; (4) require any change in the frequency of delivery to a post office box; (5) prohibit the collection or delivery of a competitive mail product on a weekend, a federal holiday, or any other specific day of the week; (6) prohibit USPS from exercising its authority to make changes to processing or retail networks; or (7) confer a cause of action, either express or implied.\n\nRequires USPS, for not less than five years after enactment of this Act, to provide package service: (1) six days per week to each street address that was eligible to receive service six days per week and to each new street address that is located in an area that was eligible to receive such service as of October 1, 2013; and (2) seven days per week to each street address for which USPS determines that such service provides an economic benefit to USPS.\n\nRequires the USPS Chief Sustainability Officer to: (1) assess the environmental impact of moving to a nationwide delivery schedule of five days per week, including the impact on greenhouse gas emissions, facility energy use, and transportation fuel use; and (2) publish the results on the USPS website.\n\n(Sec. 205) Requires USPS to: (1) use the primary mode of mail delivery that is most cost-effective and in the best long-term interest of USPS; (2) convert door delivery to other delivery modes, including centralized delivery or curbside delivery; and (3) establish and maintain a waiver program to continue door delivery if a physical hardship prevents a postal customer from receiving mail.\n\n(Sec. 206) Requires USPS to: (1)\u00a0develop and promote adequate and efficient postal services with respect to its market-dominant products, and (2) submit a proposal to PRC requesting an advisory opinion on any change in the nature of postal services relating to market-dominant products that will generally affect service on a nationwide or substantially nationwide basis.\n\nRequires PRC, upon receiving a USPS proposal, to: (1) provide notice and an opportunity for public comment on such proposal, and (2) issue an advisory opinion not later than 90 days after receipt or a date jointly determined by USPS and PRC. Requires USPS to submit a response to such advisory opinion to the President and Congress. Allows USPS to take action on its proposal after submitting its response.\n\n(Sec. 207) Requires the Postmaster General to submit to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs a report on the feasibility of a pilot program to implement the use of natural gas and propane as fuels for heavy-duty over-the-road trucks, in addition to natural gas-fueled vehicles already in the postal fleet, as a fuel cost-saving measure.\n\n(Sec. 208) Limits the number of post offices that USPS may maintain or operate in a House or Senate Office Building.\n\n(Sec. 209) Requires USPS to: (1) consider the lawful carrying or storing of a firearm in a USPS parking lot in a manner not inconsistent with state or local laws and not in violation of any lease for use of such parking lot to be a lawful purpose under the federal criminal code, (2) make corresponding amendments to the Code of Federal Regulations, and (3) post signage in each parking lot to communicate to the general public such changes in law relating to the carrying or storing of firearms. Preserves the authority of the Postmaster General to establish workplace rules for USPS employees or regulations relating to nonpublic areas of postal facilities.\n\nTitle III: Postal Service Revenue - (Sec. 301) Revises provisions relating to postal rates to authorize the USPS Board of Governors (currently, the Postal Regulatory Commission) to establish and periodically revise a system of rates and classes for market-dominant products. Sets forth factors to be taken into account in establishing or revising a system of rates, including: (1) the value of the mail service provided through each class or type of mail service to both the sender and recipient, including the educational, cultural, scientific, and informational value; (2) the direct and indirect postal costs attributable to each class or type of mail service; (3) the effect of rate increases upon postal customers; and (4) the available alternative means of sending and receiving letters and other mail matter. Requires such system of rates to be designed to achieve specified objectives, including incentivizing USPS to reduce costs and increase efficiency and to maintain high quality service standards.\n\nAuthorizes the Board, not earlier than January 1, 2017, to submit to PRC a proposal for revisions to the system or for a new system consistent with specified objectives.
