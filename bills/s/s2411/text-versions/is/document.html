            (2) as of April 2014, only 12,100,000 workers in the United 
        States were employed in the manufacturing sector, lower than 
        June 1941;
            (3) at the end of 2013, the United States had a trade 
        deficit of $474,864,000,000, including a recordbreaking

        top priority of Congress;
            (5) providing loan guarantees, direct loans, and technical 
        assistance to employees to buy their own companies will 
        preserve and increase employment in the United States; and
            (6) the time has come to establish the United States 
        Employee Ownership Bank to preserve and expand jobs in the
