Requires cost-sharing under such a plan to exceed the amount applicable to a plan at the bronze level.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health Human Services (HHS) to promulgate regulations providing for annual limits on deductibles and cost-sharing for copper-level plans to ensure that the limits are reasonable for every marketplace and to consider the feasibility of the relative plan design in each local insurance marketplace.\n\nAllows qualification of copper-level plans as multi-state plans."
