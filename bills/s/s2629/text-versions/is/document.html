 To require employers to notify employees and prospective employees of 
 exemptions from otherwise required coverage of health services under 
                          group health plans.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preventive Care Coverage 
Notification Act''.

SEC. 2. PROVIDING INFORMATION TO EMPLOYEES AND PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES.

    (a) Development of Standards.--With respect to an employer (other 
than an organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit 
entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A) (i) or (iii) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986) that establishes or maintains a group 
health plan (other than a grandfathered health plan as defined in 
section 1251 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 
U.S.C. 18011)) for its employees, the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of the Treasury 
shall jointly develop standards that require the employer to provide 
notice to current and prospective employees if the employer is exempted 
or excepted from covering health services otherwise required to be 
covered pursuant to title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act 
(including preventive health services required under section 2713 of 
such Act). Such notice shall include a description of the specific 
items and services that are not covered under such plan as a result of 
such exemption or exception. Such standards shall require that any 
notice provided under this subsection be provided by the employer to 
employees and prospective employees in a timely and easily 
understandable manner.
    (b) Informing Employees of Limitations on Coverage.--With respect 
to the notice required under subsection (a), an employer shall be 
deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of such section if the 
employer is an eligible organization as defined in, and provides for 
the notice in accordance with, regulations issued pursuant to section 
2713 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-13).
    (c) Enforcement.--The provisions of this section shall apply to 
employers acting as plan sponsors, group health plans, and health 
insurance issuers as if enacted in the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986. Any failure by an employer acting as a plan sponsor, a group 
health plan, or a health insurance issuer to comply with the provisions 
of this Act shall be subject to enforcement through part 5 of subtitle 
B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 
U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), section 2723 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 300gg-22), and section 4980D of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986.
    (d) Application.--This section shall apply to plan years beginning 
on or after July 1, 2014.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
