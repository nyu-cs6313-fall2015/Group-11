    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Field EMS 
Innovation Act''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.

                            medical services and trauma care.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) All persons throughout the United States should have 
        access to and receive high-quality emergency medical care as 
        part of a coordinated emergency medical services system.
            (2) Properly functioning emergency medical services 
        (referred to in this section as ``EMS'') systems, 24 hours per 
        day, 7 days per week, are essential to ensure access to 
        emergency medical care and transport for all patients with 
        emergency medical conditions. Such coordinated EMS systems are 
        also necessary for response to catastrophic incidents.
            (3) Ensuring high-quality and cost-effective EMS systems 
        requires readiness, preparedness, medical direction, oversight, 
        and innovation throughout the continuum of emergency medical 
        care through Federal, State, and local multijurisdictional 
        collaboration and sufficient resources for EMS agencies and 
        providers.
            (4) At the Federal level, EMS responsibilities and 
        resources of several Federal agencies consistent with their 
        expertise and authority must emphasize the critical importance 
        of Federal agency collaboration and coordination for all 
        emergency medical services.
            (5) At the State and local level, EMS systems and agencies 
        require the coordination and improved capabilities of multiple 
        and diverse stakeholders.
            (6) Emergency medical services encompass the provision of 
        care provided to patients with emergency medical conditions 
        throughout the continuum, including emergency medical care and 
        trauma care provided in the field, hospital, and rehabilitation 
        settings.
            (7) Field EMS comprises essential emergency medical 
        services, including medical care or medical transport provided 
        to patients prior to or outside medical facilities and other 
        clinical settings. The primary purpose of field emergency 
        medical services is to ensure that emergency medical patients 
        receive the right care at the right place in the right amount 
        of time.
            (8) Coordinated and high-quality field EMS is essential to 
        the Nation's security. Field EMS is an essential public service 
        provided by governmental and nongovernmental agencies and 
        practitioners 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and during 
        catastrophic incidents. To ensure disaster and all-hazards 
        preparedness for EMS operations as part of the Nation's 
        comprehensive disaster preparedness, Federal funding for 
        preparedness activities, including catastrophic training and 
        drills, must be provided to governmental and nongovernmental 
        EMS agencies to ensure a greater capability within each of 
        these areas.
            (9) Numerous recommendations from several significant 
        national reports and documents have demonstrated the need in 
        multiple areas for substantial improvement of emergency medical 
        services provided in the field, including recommendations in 
        the ``EMS Agenda for the Future'' of the National Highway 
        Traffic Safety Administration and the Health Resources and 
        Services Administration, the Institute of Medicine report ``The 
        Future of Emergency Care in the United States Health System'', 
        and the ``EMS Education Agenda for the Future: A Systems 
        Approach'', and recommendations of the National EMS Workforce 
        Injury and Illness Surveillance Program, the National EMS 
        Advisory Council of the Department of Transportation, and the 
        Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services.
            (10) To substantially improve field EMS, advancements must 
        be made in several essential areas including readiness, 
        innovation, preparedness, education and workforce development, 
        safety, financing, quality, standards, and research.
            (11) The recognition of a primary programmatic Federal 
        agency for emergency medical services within the Department of 
        Health and Human Services was recommended by the Institute of 
        Medicine and is necessary to provide a more streamlined, cost-
        efficient, and comprehensive approach for field EMS and a focal 
        point for practitioners and agencies to interface with the 
        Federal Government.
            (12) The essential role of field EMS in disaster 
        preparedness and response must be incorporated into the 
        national preparedness and response strategy and implementation 
        as provided and overseen by the Department of Homeland Security 
        and the Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to 
        their respective jurisdictions.
            (13) The essential role of the National Highway Traffic 
        Safety Administration in the continued development of the 
        National EMS Information System and in overseeing 
        transportation issues related to field EMS such as EMS and 
        ambulance vehicle safety standards should be maintained.
            (14) The Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical 
        Services must continue in its essential role in coordinating 
        the Federal activities related to the full spectrum of EMS.
