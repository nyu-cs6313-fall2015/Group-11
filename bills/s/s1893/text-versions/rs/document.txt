                                 A BILL


 
To require the Transportation Security Administration to implement best 
     practices and improve transparency with regard to technology 
             acquisition programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Security 
Acquisition Reform Act''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    Congress finds the following:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) The Transportation Security Administration 
        (referred to in this Act as ``TSA'') does not consistently 
        implement Department of Homeland Security policies and 
        Government best practices for acquisition and 
        procurement.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) TSA has not developed a multiyear technology 
        investment plan. As a result, TSA has underutilized innovation 
        opportunities within the private sector, including from small 
        businesses.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) Due in part to the deficiencies referred to in 
        paragraphs (1) and (2), TSA has faced challenges in meeting key 
        performance requirements for several major acquisitions and 
        procurements, resulting in reduced security effectiveness and 
        wasted expenditures.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 3. TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION ACQUISITION 
              REFORM.</DELETED>

    This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Security Acquisition 
Reform Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Transportation Security Administration has not 
        consistently implemented Department of Homeland Security 
        policies and Government best practices for acquisition and 
        procurement.
            (2) The Transportation Security Administration has only 
        recently developed a multiyear technology investment plan, and 
        has underutilized innovation opportunities within the private 
        sector, including from small businesses.
            (3) The Transportation Security Administration has faced 
        challenges in meeting key performance requirements for several 
        major acquisitions and procurements, resulting in reduced 
        security effectiveness and wasted expenditures.
