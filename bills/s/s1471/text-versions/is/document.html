chapter.
    ``(ii) A notice of disagreement filed with the Secretary of Defense

paragraph (4)(B), the appropriate Federal official may take any of the 
following actions:
            ``(A) Disinter the remains of the person from the cemetery 
        in the National Cemetery Administration or in Arlington 
        National Cemetery and provide for the reburial or other
