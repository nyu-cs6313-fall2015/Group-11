  <summary>6/4/2014--Introduced.
Ensuring Veterans' Resiliency Act - Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to carry out a three-year pilot program to repay the loans used to finance the education expenses related to psychiatric medicine of certain individuals who demonstrate a commitment to long-term careers as psychiatrists in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

Requires those individuals to be: (1) licensed or eligible for licensure to practice psychiatric medicine in the VHA, or (2) enrolled in the final year of a residency program leading to a specialty qualification in psychiatric medicine that is approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.

Directs the Secretary to select at least 10 individuals each year to participate in the program.

Requires program participants to agree to a period of obligated service with the VHA in the field of psychiatric medicine. Prohibits the Secretary from paying more than $60,000 on behalf of an individual for each year of obligated service the individual agrees to serve.

Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to conduct a study of pay disparities among VHA psychiatrists.

Authorizes the Secretary to carry out a pilot program providing a monthly housing allowance to individuals who: (1) are health care providers, (2) are or agree to become VHA employees on a full-time basis in a health care position designated by the Secretary, and (3) accept an assignment in such position for at least 36 months at a rural or highly rural community-based outpatient clinic selected by the Secretary.

Provides bonus housing allowances to participants who complete the 36 months of service and to those who complete additional one-year or two-year terms of service.</summary>
