                                 A BILL


 
To require the Federal Aviation Administration to prescribe regulations 
   to reduce helicopter noise pollution in residential areas in Los 
                      Angeles County, California.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Los Angeles Residential Helicopter 
Noise Relief Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Residents throughout Los Angeles County suffer 
        intrusive and disruptive low-flying helicopter traffic above 
        their neighborhoods. The unique terrain of canyons and valleys 
        that surround residential neighborhoods in Los Angeles County 
        often concentrate high decibel level noise from the low-flying 
        helicopters in and around Los Angeles County residences. The 
        concentrated noise interrupts daily life for many Los Angeles 
        County residents by drowning out conversations and disrupting 
        sleep cycles.
            (2) Los Angeles County is home to a uniquely large 
        concentration of scenic, historic, entertainment, and 
        transportation venues, including sight-seeing, movie studios, 
        movie star homes, outdoor entertainment facilities, Griffith 
        Park, the Hollywood Sign, freeways, and many others, that 
        generate extensive helicopter activity.
            (3) Los Angeles County is home to the world's leading civil 
        helicopter manufacturer that conducts extensive helicopter 
        operational testing across the region.
            (4) Despite multiple efforts from several community and 
        homeowner organizations in Los Angeles County to address these 
        disturbances, helicopter traffic in Los Angeles County is not 
        currently regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration or 
        any other agency.
            (5) At the request of Members of Congress, the Federal 
        Aviation Administration formed an internal working group in 
        July 2012 to solicit input from local communities and 
        stakeholders on helicopter noise and safety issues in Los 
        Angeles County.
            (6) As part of that process, several public meetings were 
        held in the fall and summer of 2012 that have allowed the 
        Federal Aviation Administration and stakeholders to hear and 
        better understand the concerns and complaints of affected 
        residents.
            (7) The Federal Aviation Administration is scheduled to 
        release a report in May 2013 evaluating a full set of voluntary 
        and regulatory options to reduce helicopter noise and address 
        safety issues in Los Angeles County.
            (8) The report is expected to explore how helicopters can 
        be regulated in Los Angeles County in a manner that provides 
        relief to residents from helicopter noise while also meeting 
        the needs of relevant stakeholders, including first responders.

SEC. 3. REGULATIONS TO REDUCE HELICOPTER NOISE POLLUTION IN CERTAIN 
              RESIDENTIAL AREAS.

    (a) Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall prescribe regulations for helicopter operations in 
Los Angeles County, California, that include requirements relating to 
the flight paths and altitudes associated with such operations to 
reduce helicopter noise pollution in residential areas, increase 
safety, and minimize scheduled commercial aircraft delays.
    (b) Exemptions.--In prescribing regulations under subsection (a), 
the Administrator shall exempt helicopter operations related to 
emergency, law enforcement, or military activities from the 
requirements described in that subsection.
    (c) Consultations.--In prescribing regulations under subsection 
(a), the Administrator shall make reasonable efforts to consult with 
local communities and local helicopter operators in order to develop 
regulations that meet the needs of local communities, helicopter 
operators, and the Federal Aviation Administration.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
