  <summary>5/1/2014--Introduced.
Pedestrian Safety Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT), through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), to issue a final rule that: (1) establishes standards for the hood and bumper areas of motor vehicles, including passenger cars, multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks, and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating of 4,536 kilograms (10,000 pounds) or less, in order to reduce the number of injuries and fatalities suffered by pedestrians who are struck by such vehicles; and (2) considers the protection of vulnerable pedestrian populations, including children and older adults.

Allows a federal share of up to 100% for any projects for pedestrian hybrid beacons and roadway improvements that provide separation between pedestrians and motor vehicles, including pedestrian sidewalks and crossing islands.

Declares that highway safety improvement projects include one or more projects for safety public awareness campaigns.</summary>
