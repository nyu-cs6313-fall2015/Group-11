                                 An Act


 
  To measure the progress of recovery and development efforts in Haiti 
  following the earthquake of January 12, 2010, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Assessing Progress in Haiti Act of 
2014''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near the 
    Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving an estimated 
    220,000 people dead, including 103 United States citizens, 101 
    United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent of the nation's 
    civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, 115,000 homes destroyed, 
    and 1,500,000 people displaced.
        (2) According to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted 
    by the Government of Haiti, with technical assistance from the 
    United Nations, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development 
    Bank, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, 
    and the European Commission, an estimated 15 percent of the 
    population was directly affected by the disaster and related 
    damages and economic losses totaled $7,804,000,000.
        (3) Even before the earthquake, Haiti had some of the lowest 
    socioeconomic indicators and the second highest rate of income 
    disparity in the world, conditions that have further complicated 
    post-earthquake recovery efforts and, according to the World Bank, 
    have significantly reduced the prospects of addressing poverty 
    reduction through economic growth.
        (4) According to the World Food Programme, more than 6,700,000 
    people in Haiti (out of a population of about 10,000,000) are 
    considered food insecure.
        (5) In October 2010, an unprecedented outbreak of cholera in 
    Haiti resulted in over 500,000 reported cases and over 8,000 deaths 
    to date, further straining the capacity of Haiti's public health 
    sector and increasing the urgency of resettlement and water, 
    sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) efforts.
        (6) The international community, led by the United States and 
    the United Nations, mounted an unprecedented humanitarian response 
    in Haiti, with donors pledging approximately $10,400,000,000 for 
    humanitarian relief and recovery efforts, including debt relief, 
    supplemented by $3,100,000,000 in private charitable contributions, 
    of which approximately $6,400,000,000 has been disbursed and an 
    additional $3,800,000,000 has been committed as of September 30, 
    2013.
        (7) The emergency response of the men and women of the United 
    States Government, led by the United States Agency for 
    International Development (USAID) and the United States Southern 
    Command, as well as of cities, towns, individuals, businesses, and 
    philanthropic organizations across the United States, was 
    particularly swift and resolute.
        (8) Since 2010, a total of $1,300,000,000 in United States 
    assistance has been allocated for humanitarian relief and 
    $2,300,000,000 has been allocated for recovery, reconstruction, and 
    development assistance in Haiti, including $1,140,000,000 in 
    emergency appropriations and $95,000,000 that has been obligated 
    specifically to respond to the cholera epidemic.
        (9) Of the $3,600,000,000 in United States assistance allocated 
    for Haiti, $651,000,000 was apportioned to USAID to support an 
    ambitious recovery plan, including the construction of a power 
    plant to provide electricity for the new Caracol Industrial Park 
    (CIP) in northern Haiti, a new port near the CIP, and permanent 
    housing in new settlements in the Port-au-Prince, St-Marc, and Cap-
    Haitien areas.
        (10) According to a recent report of the Government 
    Accountability Office, as of June 30, 2013, USAID had disbursed 31 
    percent of its reconstruction funds in Haiti, the port project was 
    2 years behind schedule and USAID funding will be insufficient to 
    cover a majority of the projected costs, the housing project has 
    been reduced by 80 percent, and the sustainability of the power 
    plant, the port, and the housing projects were all at risk.
        (11) GAO further found that Congress has not been provided with 
    sufficient information to ensure that it is able to conduct 
    effective oversight at a time when most funding remains to be 
    disbursed, and specifically recommends that a periodic reporting 
    mechanism be instituted to fill this information gap.
        (12) Donors have encountered significant challenges in 
    implementing recovery programs, and nearly 4 years after the 
    earthquake, an estimated 171,974 people remain displaced in camps, 
    unemployment remains high, corruption is rampant, land rights 
    remain elusive, allegations of wage violations are widespread, the 
    business climate is unfavorable, and government capacity remains 
    weak.
        (13) For Haiti to achieve stability and long term economic 
    growth, donor assistance will have to be carefully coordinated with 
    a commitment by the Government of Haiti to transparency, a market 
    economy, rule of law, and democracy.
        (14) The legal environment in Haiti remains a challenge to 
    achieving the goals supported by the international community.
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
    It is the policy of the United States to support the sustainable 
rebuilding and development of Haiti in a manner that--
        (1) promotes efforts that are led by and support the people and 
    Government of Haiti at all levels so that Haitians lead the course 
    of reconstruction and development of Haiti;
        (2) builds the long term capacity of the Government of Haiti 
    and civil society in Haiti;
        (3) reflects the priorities and particular needs of both women 
    and men so they may participate equally and to their maximum 
    capacity;
        (4) respects and helps restore Haiti's natural resources, as 
    well as builds community-level resilience to environmental and 
    weather-related impacts;
        (5) provides timely and comprehensive reporting on goals and 
    progress, as well as transparent post program evaluations and 
    contracting data;

    Haiti where appropriate; and
        (7) promotes the holding of free, fair, and timely elections in 
    accordance with democratic principles and the Haitian Constitution.
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.
    It is the sense of Congress that transparency, accountability, 
democracy, and good governance are integral factors in any 
congressional decision regarding United States assistance, including 
assistance to Haiti.
