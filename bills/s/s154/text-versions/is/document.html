 To amend title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to 
  ensure that the coverage offered under multi-State qualified health 
  plans offered in Exchanges is consistent with the Federal abortion 
                              funding ban.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing the Offering of Elective 
Coverage of Taxpayer-Funded-Abortion Act of 2013'' or the ``PROTECT 
Act''.

SEC. 2. CONSISTENCY WITH FEDERAL ABORTION FUNDING BAN FOR COVERAGE 
              UNDER MULTI-STATE PLANS IN EXCHANGES.

    (a) In General.--Paragraph (6) of section 1334(a) of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18054(a)(6)) is amended 
to read as follows:
            ``(6) Consistency with federal abortion funding ban.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In entering into contracts under 
                this subsection, the Director shall ensure that no 
                multi-State qualified health plan offered in an 
                Exchange provides for coverage of abortions.
                    ``(B) Exception.--The limitation established in 
                subparagraph (A) shall not apply to an abortion--
                            ``(i) if the pregnancy is the result of an 
                        act of rape or incest; or
                            ``(ii) in a case where a woman suffers from 
                        a physical disorder, physical injury, or 
                        physical illness that would, as certified by a 
                        physician, place the woman in danger of death 
                        unless an abortion is performed, including a 
                        life-endangering physical condition caused by 
                        or arising from the pregnancy itself.''.
    (b) Preemption.--Section 1303(c) of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18023(c)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``Nothing in this Act'' 
        and inserting ``Subject to paragraph (4), nothing in this 
        Act''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(4) Application of limitation for multi-state plans.--
        Paragraph (6) of section 1334(a) shall preempt any State law 
        requiring coverage of or funding for abortions with respect to 
        the application of such law to multi-State qualified health 
        plans.''.
