  To require the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a report on the 
   status of greater sage-grouse conservation efforts, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sage-Grouse Accountability and 
Private Conservation Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) pursuant to the court-approved work schedule described 
        in the Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement Agreement and 
        Order of Dismissal of Guardians Claims entitled ``In Re 
        Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation'' (D.D.C. 
        2011), not later than September 30, 2015, the Secretary is 
        scheduled to issue a decision on whether to proceed with 
        listing the greater sage-grouse as a threatened or endangered 
        species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 
        1531 et seq.);
            (2) the Federal Government, through programs of the 
        Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture, 
        has invested substantial funds on greater and Gunnison sage-
        grouse conservation efforts to avoid the greater and Gunnison 
        sage-grouse being listed as threatened or endangered species 
        under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et 
        seq.);
            (3) State wildlife management agencies have prepared, and 
        as of the date of enactment of this Act are in the process of 
        implementing, greater and Gunnison sage-grouse conservation 
        plans to complement the conservation efforts of the Federal 
        Government;
            (4) private investment in conservation efforts, 
        independently and in conjunction with Federal cost-share 
        conservation easement programs, has been significant;
            (5) through a combination of Federal, State, and private 
        efforts, significant conservation progress is being made, and 
        further progress will be made following full implementation of 
        State management plans and new Federal conservation programs; 
        and
            (6) farmers, ranchers, developers, and small businesses 
        need certainty, and further clarity on the likelihood of a 
        listing decision will provide that certainty.

    In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the 
Interior.
