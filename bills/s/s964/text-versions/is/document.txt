    (a) Comprehensive Review Required.--
            (1) Review of personnel.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
        carry out a review of the adequacy of the training, 
        qualifications, and experience of each member of the Armed 
        Forces and civilian employee of the Department of Defense who 
        is currently responsible for sexual assault prevention and 
        response within the Armed Forces for the discharge of such 
        responsibility.
            (2) Assessment of certain elements of prevention and 
        response program.--In carrying out the review under paragraph 
        (1), the Secretary shall also conduct an assessment of the 
        adequacy of the training and certifications required for 
        certain such personnel by section 584 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81; 125 
        Stat. 1433; 10 U.S.C. 1561).
    (b) Responsive Personnel Actions.--If as a result of the review

responsibility referred to in that subsection, the Secretary shall take 
appropriate responsive actions, including--
            (1) re-training or re-certification of such member or 
        civilian employee; or
            (2) reassigning such member or civilian employee to duties 
        other than sexual assault prevention and response and replacing 
        such member or civilian with a member or civilian employee 
        qualified to discharge such responsibility.
    (c) Responsive Actions Regarding Program Elements.--Upon completion 
of the review under subsection (a), the Secretary shall prescribe in 
regulations the following:
            (1) Appropriate minimum levels of training, qualifications, 
        and experience for members of the Armed Forces and civilian 
        personnel of the Department for the discharge of 
        responsibilities for sexual assault prevention and response 
        within the Armed Forces.
            (2) Such requirements for improvements in the training 
        provided to members and civilian employees referred to in 
        paragraph (1) as the Secretary considers appropriate, including 
        improvements to the training and certifications referred to in 
        subsection (a)(2), in order to ensure that such members and 
        civilian employees are properly trained and certified to 
        discharge responsibilities for sexual assault prevention and 
        response within the Armed Forces.
                                 <all>
