                            infrastructure.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Rebuild America Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should--
            (1) create jobs and support businesses while improving our 
        Nation's global competitiveness by modernizing and 
        strengthening our national infrastructure;
            (2) invest resources in transportation corridors of 
        national and regional significance that promote commerce and 
        reduce congestion;
            (3) update and enhance our national network of rail, dams, 
        and ports of the United States;
            (4) develop innovative financing mechanisms for 
        infrastructure, such as an infrastructure bank, to leverage 
        Federal funds with private sector partners;
            (5) invest in critical infrastructure, such as a smarter 
        national energy grid, to reduce energy waste and bolster 
        investment in clean energy jobs and industries;
            (6) invest in clean energy technologies that help free the 
        United States from its dependence on oil, especially foreign 
        oil;
            (7) eliminate wasteful tax subsidies that promote pollution 
        and fail to reduce our reliance on foreign oil;
            (8) spur innovation by facilitating the development of new 
        cutting-edge broadband internet technology and improving 
        internet access for all Americans;
            (9) modernize, renovate, and repair elementary and 
        secondary school buildings in public school districts and 
        community colleges across the United States in order to support 
        improved educational outcomes in those schools;
            (10) invest in the Nation's crumbling water infrastructure 
        to protect public health and reduce pollution;
            (11) upgrade and repair the Nation's system of flood 
        protection infrastructure, such as levees, to protect public 
        safety; and
            (12) invest in the infrastructure of the United States to 
        address vulnerabilities to natural disasters and the impacts of 
        extreme weather.
