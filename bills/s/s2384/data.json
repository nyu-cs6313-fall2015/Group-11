Requires each report to: (1) identify countries that engage in such espionage, including countries that facilitate, support, fail to prosecute, or otherwise permit such espionage; (2) specify the countries that engage in the most egregious forms of such espionage; and (3) describe actions taken and progress made by the President to decrease the prevalence of such espionage.\n\nAuthorizes the President to block and prohibit transactions in property, and interests in property, of a foreign person the President determines knowingly requests, engages in, supports, facilitates, or benefits from the significant appropriation, through economic or industrial espionage in cyberspace, of technologies or proprietary information developed by U.S. persons if such property and interests in property: (1) are in the United States; (2) come within the United States; or (3) are, or come within, the possession or control of a U.S. person. Prohibits the President from imposing sanctions on the importation of goods under such authority."
