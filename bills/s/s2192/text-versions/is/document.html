                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the National Alzheimer's Project Act to require the Director 
of the National Institutes of Health to prepare and submit, directly to 
the President for review and transmittal to Congress, an annual budget 
  estimate (including an estimate of the number and type of personnel 
     needs for the Institutes) for the initiatives of the National 
               Institutes of Health pursuant to such Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Alzheimer's Accountability Act of 
2014.''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Alzheimer's disease is the most expensive disease in 
        the United States today. Its costs are set to increase like the 
        costs of no other disease and will be carried in substantial 
        measure through the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
            (2) Through the unanimous, bipartisan passage of the 
        National Alzheimer's Project Act (Public Law 111-375), the 
        111th Congress recognized the national imperative to act and 
        instructed the Nation's scientists to develop a plan to change 
        the trajectory of this disease.
            (3) Scientists at the National Institutes of Health have 
        prepared and presented to Congress a national plan to prevent 
        and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025, including 
        the underlying specification of milestones and timelines to 
        achieve this goal.
            (4) Capital budgeting is a universally accepted best 
        practice for the successful management of such a multiyear 
        project, but such projections have not been prepared and 
        provided to Congress to achieve the 2025 goal, preventing 
        Congress from exercising truly effective oversight over a 
        venture of profound importance to the Nation.

SEC. 3. PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT BUDGET FOR INITIATIVES OF NIH UNDER 
              NATIONAL ALZHEIMER'S PROJECT.

    Section 2 of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (Public Law 111-
375) (41 U.S.C. 11225) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsection (h) as subsection (i); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (g) the following:
    ``(h) Professional Judgment Budget.--For each fiscal year through 
fiscal year 2025, the Director of the National Institutes of Health 
shall prepare and submit, directly to the President for review and 
transmittal to Congress, after reasonable opportunity for comment (but 
without change) by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the 
Advisory Council, an annual budget estimate (including an estimate of 
the number and type of personnel needs for the Institutes) for the 
initiatives of the National Institutes of Health pursuant to this 
Act.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
