SEC. 8. ANALYSIS BY THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION OF THE 
              COSTS AND BENEFITS OF REGULATIONS AND ORDERS.

    Section 15(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 19(a)) is 
amended by striking paragraphs (1) and (2) and inserting the following:
            ``(1) In general.--Before promulgating a regulation under 
        this Act or issuing an order (except as provided in paragraph 
        (3)), the Commission, acting through the Office of the Chief 
        Economist, shall--
                    ``(A) state a justification for the regulation or 
                order;
                    ``(B) state the baseline for the cost-benefit 
                analysis and explain how the regulation or order 
                measures costs against the baseline;
                    ``(C) assess the costs and benefits, both 
                qualitative and quantitative, of the intended 
                regulation or order;
                    ``(D) measure, and seek to improve, the actual 
                results of regulatory requirements; and
                    ``(E) propose or adopt a regulation or order only 
                on a reasoned determination that the benefits of the 
                intended regulation or order justify the costs of the 
                intended regulation or order (recognizing that some 
                benefits and costs are difficult to quantify).
            ``(2) Considerations.--In making a reasoned determination 
        of costs and benefits under paragraph (1), the Commission shall 
        consider--
                    ``(A) the protection of market participants and the 
                public;
                    ``(B) the efficiency, competitiveness, and 
                financial integrity of futures and swaps markets;
                    ``(C) the impact on market liquidity in the futures 
                and swaps markets;
                    ``(D) price discovery;
                    ``(E) sound risk management practices;
                    ``(F) the cost of available alternatives to direct 
                regulation;
                    ``(G) the degree and nature of the risks posed by 
                various activities within the scope of the jurisdiction 
                of the Commission;
                    ``(H) whether, consistent with obtaining regulatory 
                objectives, the regulation or order is tailored to 
                impose the least burden on society, including market 
                participants, individuals, businesses of differing 
                sizes, and other entities (including small communities 
                and governmental entities), taking into account, to the 
                extent practicable, the cumulative costs of regulations 
                and orders;
                    ``(I) whether the regulation or order is 
                inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative of other 
                Federal regulations and orders; and
                    ``(J) whether, in choosing among alternative 
                regulatory approaches, those approaches maximize net 
                benefits (including potential economic, environmental, 
                and other benefits, distributive impacts, and 
                equity).''.
