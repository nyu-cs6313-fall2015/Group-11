  <summary>12/18/2013--Introduced.
Premium Disclosure Act - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, with respect to state health care exchanges, to revise open enrollment period requirements so that such periods commence on October 15 and end on December 7 of each calendar year after the initial open enrollment period. Prohibits modification of such dates by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Requires the Secretary to carry out activities to broadly disseminate information to qualified individuals (and those who may become qualified individuals) concerning open enrollment periods, monthly premiums, and cost-sharing requirements under qualified health plans, ensuring that such information is first made available at least 30 days prior to the initial open enrollment period.</summary>
