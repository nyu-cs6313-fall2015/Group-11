        interfere with Federal law enforcement efforts or is prohibited 
        by law.

        internal Executive branch deliberative processes or protecting 
        other information properly subject to privilege.

            (1) In general.--Any opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel 
        that would have been selected for publication under the process 
        of review established under subsection (a) but for the fact 
        that publication would reveal classified or other sensitive 
        information relating to national security shall be provided or 
        made available to the appropriate committees of Congress.
            (2) Exception for covert action.--If the President 
        determines that it is essential to limit access to a covert 
        action finding under section 503(c)(2) of the National Security

        otherwise be provided or made available under this subsection 
        to those members of Congress who have been granted access to 
        such finding under such section 503(c)(2).
    (f) Judicial Review.--The determination whether an opinion of the 
Office of Legal Counsel is appropriate for official publication under 
the process of review established under subsection (a) is discretionary 
and is not subject to judicial review.

Agency, shall--
            ``(1) ensure that--
                    ``(A) any contractor to an element of the 
                intelligence community with access to a classified 
                network or classified information develops and operates 
                a security plan that is consistent with standards 
                established by the Director of National Intelligence 
                for intelligence community networks; and
                    ``(B) each contract awarded by an element of the 
                intelligence community includes provisions requiring 
                the contractor comply with such plan and such 
                standards;
            ``(2) conduct periodic assessments of each security plan 
        required under paragraph (1)(A) to ensure such security plan 
        complies with the requirements of such paragraph; and
            ``(3) ensure that the insider threat detection capabilities 
        and insider threat policies of the intelligence community apply

        network.''.
    (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to contracts entered into or renewed after the date

SEC. 503. TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS TO SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESSING.

    (a) In General.--The Director of National Intelligence, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Director of the 
Office of Personnel Management, shall conduct an analysis of the 
relative costs and benefits of potential improvements to the process 
for investigating persons who are proposed for access to classified 
information and adjudicating whether such persons satisfy the criteria 
for obtaining and retaining access to such information.
    (b) Contents of Analysis.--In conducting the analysis required by 
subsection (a), the Director of National Intelligence shall evaluate 
the costs and benefits associated with--
            (1) the elimination of manual processes in security 
        clearance investigations and adjudications, if possible, and 
        automating and integrating the elements of the investigation 
        process, including--
                    (A) the clearance application process;
                    (B) case management;
                    (C) adjudication management;
                    (D) investigation methods for the collection, 
                analysis, storage, retrieval, and transfer of data and 
                records; and
                    (E) records management for access and eligibility 
                determinations;
            (2) the elimination or reduction, if possible, of the use 
        of databases and information sources that cannot be accessed 
        and processed automatically electronically, or modification of 
        such databases and information sources, to enable electronic 
        access and processing;
            (3) the use of government-developed and commercial 
        technology for continuous monitoring and evaluation of 
        government and commercial data sources that can identify and 
        flag information pertinent to adjudication guidelines and 
        eligibility determinations;
            (4) the standardization of forms used for routine reporting 
        required of cleared personnel (such as travel, foreign 
        contacts, and financial disclosures) and use of continuous 
        monitoring technology to access databases containing such 
        reportable information to independently obtain and analyze 
        reportable data and events;
            (5) the establishment of an authoritative central 
        repository of personnel security information that is accessible 
        electronically at multiple levels of classification and 
        eliminates technical barriers to rapid access to information 
        necessary for eligibility determinations and reciprocal 
        recognition thereof;
            (6) using digitally processed fingerprints, as a substitute 
        for ink or paper prints, to reduce error rates and improve 
        portability of data;
            (7) expanding the use of technology to improve an 
        applicant's ability to discover the status of a pending 
        security clearance application or reinvestigation; and
            (8) using government and publicly available commercial data 
        sources, including social media, that provide independent 
        information pertinent to adjudication guidelines to improve 
        quality and timeliness, and reduce costs, of investigations and 
        reinvestigations.
    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 6 months after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall

        accepted by another agency;
            (3) the total number of cases in which a background

        confirming the eligibility of personnel for continued access to 
        classified information; and
            (5) an analysis of how many personnel with out-of-scope
