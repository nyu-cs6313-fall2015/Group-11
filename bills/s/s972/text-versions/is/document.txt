    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services may not 
implement, administer, or enforce the regulations issued on January 16, 
2009 (74 Fed. Reg. 3328), the regulation issued on September 5, 2012 
(77 Fed. Reg. 54664), or any similar regulation, insofar as any such 
regulation provides for the replacement of ICD-9 with ICD-10 as a 
standard for code sets under section 1173(c) of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 1320d-2(c)) and section 162.1002 of title 45, Code of

            (1) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States, 
        in consultation with stakeholders in the medical community, 
        shall conduct a study to identify steps that can be taken to 
        mitigate the disruption on health care providers resulting from 
        a replacement of ICD-9 as such a standard.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to 
        each House of Congress a report on such study. Such report

        and such legislative and administrative steps as may be 
        appropriate to mitigate the disruption resulting from such 
        replacement as the Comptroller General determines appropriate.
