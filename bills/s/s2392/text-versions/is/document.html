 To amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate certain segments 
 of East Rosebud Creek in Carbon County, Montana, as components of the 
                     Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``East Rosebud Wild and Scenic Rivers 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) East Rosebud Creek is cherished by the people of 
        Montana and visitors from across the United States for the 
        clean water, spectacular natural setting, and outstanding 
        recreational opportunities of the Creek;
            (2) recreational activities (including fishing, hunting, 
        camping, paddling, hiking, rock climbing, and wildlife 
        watching) on East Rosebud Creek and the surrounding land 
        generate millions of dollars annually for the local economy;
            (3) East Rosebud Creek--
                    (A) is a national treasure;
                    (B) possesses outstandingly remarkable values; and
                    (C) merits the high level of protection afforded by 
                the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) 
                in order to maintain the benefits provided by the 
                Creek, as described in paragraphs (1) and (2), for 
                future generations to enjoy; and
            (4) designation of select public land segments of East 
        Rosebud Creek under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 
        1271 et seq.) would recognize the importance of maintaining the 
        values of the Creek while preserving public access, respecting 
        private property rights, allowing appropriate maintenance of 
        existing infrastructure, and allowing historical uses of the 
        Creek to continue.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to designate East Rosebud 
Creek in the State of Montana as a component of the National Wild and 
Scenic Rivers System to preserve and protect for present and future 
generations the outstandingly remarkable scenic, wildlife, fishery 
recreational, geologic, and historical values of the Creek.
