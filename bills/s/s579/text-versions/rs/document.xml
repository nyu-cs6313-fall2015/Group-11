				<paragraph id="id29462aa6554f41d09e553f84a9b7133e"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Safe, secure, and
			 economical international air navigation and transport is important to every
			 citizen of the world, and safe skies are ensured through uniform aviation
			 standards, harmonization of security protocols, and expeditious dissemination
			 of information regarding new regulations and other relevant matters.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id7f1a60b53515437788a5bb3b3458c35b"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Direct and
			 unobstructed participation in international civil aviation forums and programs
			 is beneficial for all nations and their civil aviation authorities. Civil
			 aviation is vital to all due to the international transit and commerce it makes
			 possible, but must also be closely regulated due to the possible use of
			 aircraft as weapons of mass destruction or to transport biological, chemical,
			 and nuclear weapons or other dangerous materials.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id7d20c6d551174cbf9597aec6c00fddfb"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Convention on
			 International Civil Aviation, signed at Chicago, Illinois, December 7, 1944,
			 and entered into force April 4, 1947, established the International Civil
			 Aviation Organization (ICAO), stating that <quote>[t]he aims and objectives of
			 the Organization are to develop the principles and techniques of international
			 air navigation and to foster the planning and development of international air
			 transport so as to … [m]eet the needs of the peoples of the world for safe,
			 regular, efficient and economical air transport</quote>.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id7535057f82124161817c821c6092884c"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The terrorist
			 attacks of September 11, 2001, demonstrated that the global civil aviation
			 network is subject to vulnerabilities that can be exploited in one country to
			 harm another. The ability of civil aviation authorities to coordinate, preempt,
			 and act swiftly and in unison is an essential element of crisis prevention and
			 response.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id683fda14b308441f81b5b8ebc4f879a0"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Following the
			 terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the ICAO convened a high-level
			 Ministerial Conference on Aviation Security that endorsed a global strategy for
			 strengthening aviation security worldwide and issued a public declaration that
			 <quote>a uniform approach in a global system is essential to ensure aviation
			 security throughout the world and that deficiencies in any part of the system
			 constitute a threat to the entire global system,</quote> and that there should
			 be a commitment to <quote>foster international cooperation in the field of
			 aviation security and harmonize the implementation of security
			 measures</quote>.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id217e10d50ff84a78b2ada973bd967a1b"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Taipei Flight
			 Information Region, under the jurisdiction of Taiwan, covers an airspace of
			 180,000 square nautical miles and provides air traffic control services to over
			 1,200,000 flights annually, with the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
			 recognized as the 10th and 19th largest airport by international cargo volume
			 and number of international passengers, respectively, in 2011.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id29f217324f2f4223ba200d945a5ff77a"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Despite the
			 established international consensus regarding a uniform approach to aviation
			 security that fosters international cooperation, exclusion from the ICAO since
			 1971 has impeded the efforts of the Government of Taiwan to maintain civil
			 aviation practices that comport with evolving international standards, due to
			 its inability to contact the ICAO for up-to-date information on aviation
			 standards and norms, secure amendments to the organization’s regulations in a
			 timely manner, obtain sufficient and timely information needed to prepare for
			 the implementation of new systems and procedures set forth by the ICAO, receive
			 technical assistance in implementing new regulations, and participate in
			 technical and academic seminars hosted by the ICAO.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id320d8b4253ba4ab6a5b6c3435056d58f"><enum>(8)</enum><text>On October 8,
			 2010, the Department of State praised the 37th ICAO Assembly on its adoption of
			 a Declaration on Aviation Security, but noted that <quote>because every airport
			 offers a potential entry point into this global system, every nation faces the
			 threat from gaps in aviation security throughout the world—and all nations must
			 share the responsibility for securing that system</quote>.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id23bcccd06a174281b62442fb7a905c4d"><enum>(9)</enum><text>On October 2,
			 2012, Taiwan became the 37th participant to join the United States Visa Waiver
			 program, which is expected to stimulate tourism and commerce that will rely
			 increasingly on international commercial aviation.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id56fafc3f35444017836618f7e51be80b"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The Government
			 of Taiwan’s exclusion from the ICAO constitutes a serious gap in global
			 standards that should be addressed at the earliest opportunity in advance of
			 the 38th ICAO Assembly in September 2013.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="id27cc3c5befe2494faa42753c163976d6"><enum>(11)</enum><text>The Federal
