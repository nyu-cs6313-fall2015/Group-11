                                 A BILL


 
To require a report on accountability for war crimes and crimes against 
                           humanity in Syria.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Syrian War Crimes Accountability Act 
of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On February 22, 2014, the United Nations Security 
        Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2139 recognizing the 
        escalating level of violence in Syria.
            (2) Credible sources estimate the death of more than 
        140,000 people in Syria, including 10,000 children.
            (3) On February 27, 2014, the Department of State issued 
        its 2013 Human Rights Report on Syria, which described 
        President Bashar al Assad's use of ``indiscriminate and deadly 
        force'' in the conflict, including the August 21, 2013, use of 
        ``sarin gas and artillery to target East Ghouta and Moadamiya 
        al-Sham, suburbs of Damascus, which killed over 1,000 people.''
            (4) The United Nations Independent International Commission 
        of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic reports that pro-
        government forces have conducted attacks on Syrian civilian 
        populations, and have utilized murder, torture, assault, and 
        rape as war tactics. Anti-government groups have also committed 
        murder and torture, engaged in hostage-taking, attacked 
        protected objects, and shelled civilian neighborhoods.
            (5) Internationally accepted rules of war require actors to 
        distinguish between civilians and combatants and that all 
        parties adhere to the principle of medical neutrality whereby 
        both sides ensure unhindered access to medical care.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    Congress--
            (1) strongly condemns the ongoing violence, use of chemical 
        weapons, targeting of civilian populations with barrel, 
        incendiary and cluster bombs, and SCUD missiles, and systematic 
        gross human rights violations carried out by Government of 
        Syria and pro-government forces under the direction of 
        President Bashar al-Assad, as well as abuses committed by 
        violent extremist groups and other combatants involved in the 
        civil war in Syria;
            (2) expresses its support for the people of Syria seeking 
        democratic change;
            (3) urges all parties to the conflict to immediately halt 
        indiscriminate attacks on civilians;
            (4) calls on the President to support efforts in Syria and 
        on the part of the international community to ensure 
        accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity 
        committed during the conflict; and
            (5) calls for a United Nations Security Council 
        investigation into gross violations of human rights and war 
        crimes committed during the Syrian conflict.
