Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the

of title 5, United States Code) determine whether the terms of a 
settlement agreement or the existence of a settlement agreement will be 
treated as confidential, which shall include recommendations, if any, 
for legislative or administrative action to increase the transparency 
of Government settlements while continuing to protect the legitimate 
interests that confidentiality provisions serve.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
