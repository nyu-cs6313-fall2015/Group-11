Extends such ban from one to six years for officers and employees of the Senate, personal staff of Members, committee staff, leadership staff, and other legislative offices.\n\nProhibits for a six-year period the hiring of a registered lobbyist or agent of a foreign principal by a Member of Congress or a congressional committee with whom the lobbyist or agent has had a substantial lobbying contact.\n\nAmends the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to: (1) direct the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives to maintain a joint lobbyist disclosure Internet database for information required to be publicly disclosed by such Act, (2) require a substantial lobbying entity to file with Congress a list of any employees who provide paid consulting services and who are former Members of Congress or highly-paid congressional staffers, and (3) increase the civil penalty for violations of the disclosure or reporting provisions of such Act."
