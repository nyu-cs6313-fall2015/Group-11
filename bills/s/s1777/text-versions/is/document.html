SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Innovation has historically been a catalyzing force in 
        the American economy, driving the production of game-changing 
        technologies, the creation of millions of jobs and the opening 
        of countless new avenues for growth. In an increasingly 
        competitive global economy, our Nation's continued leadership 
        and prosperity will hinge on progress in key innovative areas, 
        most notably exporting, entrepreneurship, research and 
        development, and education in science, technology, engineering, 
        and mathematics (STEM), including computer science.
            (2) Technology-based startups play a critical role in 
        driving innovation. Increasing the flow of capital to these 
        firms would bridge the gap that often exists between their 
        initial startup costs and their long-term capital needs, giving 
        the firms the resources necessary to research, develop, and 
        commercialize new products.
            (3) Simplifying, expanding, and stabilizing the tax credits 
        that businesses and institutions of higher education rely on to 
        offset the cost of research and would promote greater clarity 
        in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and deliver a powerful 
        incentive for private sector innovation.
            (4) Increasing the emphasis on STEM education in high 
        schools and institutions of higher education would ensure that 
        more students have the skills and training to not only compete 
        for jobs in a 21st century economy, but also to create the 
        startup companies and revolutionary technologies that will 
        sustain American prosperity for centuries to come.
            (5) The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts 
        that in the year 2020, of the 9,200,000 ``STEM'' jobs there 
        will be in the United States, half of them will be in 
        computing. With more than 150,000 job openings expected 
        annually in computing, it is one of the fastest growing 
        occupations in the United States. Increasing the teaching and 
        learning of computer science in schools would strengthen the 
        American workforce by helping our students gain the skills and 
        training necessary to fulfill new computer programming jobs.
            (6) An effective regulatory climate should protect 
        consumers and promote transparency without overburdening the 
        businesses that create jobs. Federal agencies with rulemaking 
        authority should be vigilant in assessing the impact of new 
        regulations on innovation and job creation, particularly in 
        anchor industries like manufacturing.
            (7) The economic impact of a new product or technology is 
        often dependent on its commercial success. To ensure American 
        products can be bought and sold in markets around the world, 
        the Government should identify and remove over burdensome 
        regulations that create barriers for United States exporting 
        companies.

        any, in which it may be appropriate to roll over award fees 
        that are not earned in one award fee period to a subsequent 
        award fee period or periods;
            (7) ensure that the Department or agency--
                    (A) collects relevant data on award and incentive 
                fees paid to contractors; and
                    (B) has mechanisms in place to evaluate such data 
                on a regular basis; and
            (8) include performance measures to evaluate the 
        effectiveness of award and incentive fees as a tool for 
        improving contractor performance and achieving desired program 
        outcomes.
    (c) Return of Unearned Bonuses.--Any funds intended to be awarded 
as incentive fees that are not paid due to contractors' inability to 
meet the criteria established by this section shall be returned to the 
Treasury.
