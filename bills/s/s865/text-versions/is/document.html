United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Accelerating the 
End of Breast Cancer Act of 2013''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings.
Sec. 3. Establishment.
Sec. 4. Purpose; duties.
Sec. 5. Membership.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the United States, the chance of a woman developing 
        breast cancer during her lifetime has increased from 1 in 11 in 
        1975 to 1 in 8 today.
            (2) Worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently 
        diagnosed cancer in women with 1,300,000 cases each year. 
        Breast cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death in 
        women, with more than 438,000 women dying from the disease 
        worldwide in 2010, a 37.5 percent increase since 1990.
            (3) More than 90 percent of deaths from breast cancer are 
        caused by metastasis, which occurs when cancerous cells spread 
        to other organs or bone.
            (4) The National Cancer Institute estimated that breast 
        cancer care in the United States cost $16,500,000,000 in 2010, 
        and cost the Nation $12,100,000,000 in lost productivity.
            (5) Over the past 40 years, very little has improved the 
        incidence, morbidity, and mortality rates of breast cancer.
            (6) In recognition of the complexity of breast cancer, 
        experts have identified the need to transform how research is 
        conducted by engaging investigators from many disciplines.
            (7) Advances in understanding the progression of breast 
        cancer, particularly metastasis, have the potential to 
        translate to better understanding and preventing the spread of 
        other types of cancer.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.

Commission to Accelerate the End of Breast Cancer (in this Act referred
