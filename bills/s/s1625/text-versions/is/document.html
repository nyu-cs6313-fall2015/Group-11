                subparagraph (C); and
                    (B) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``The 
                regulations shall permit such motor carriers to conduct 
                preemployment testing of such employees for the use of 
                alcohol.'' and inserting the following:
    ``(B) The regulations prescribed under subparagraph (A) shall

        vehicle operators for the use of alcohol;
            ``(ii) to use hair testing as an acceptable alternative to 
        urinalysis--
                    ``(I) in conducting preemployment screening for the 
                use of a controlled substance; and
                    ``(II) in conducting random screening for the use 
                of a controlled substance if such method is also used 
                for preemployment screening.''; and
            (2) in subsection (c)(2)--
                    (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the 
                end;
                    (B) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``and'' after 
                the semicolon; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(D) laboratory protocols and cut-off levels for 
                hair testing to detect the use of a controlled 
                substance;''.

SEC. 3. EXEMPTION FROM MANDATORY URINALYSIS.

    (a) In General.--Any motor carrier that demonstrates, to the 
satisfaction of the Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration, that it has consistently carried out a generally 
applicable hair testing program to detect the use of a controlled 
substance by commercial motor vehicle operators during the most recent 
1-year period, may apply to the Administrator for an exemption from the 
mandatory urinalysis testing requirements set forth in subpart C of 
part 382 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations until a final rule is 
issued implementing the amendments made by section 2.
    (b) Reporting Requirement.--Any motor carrier that is granted an 
exemption under subsection (a) shall submit records to the national 
clearinghouse established under section 31306a of title 49, United 
States Code, relating to all positive test results and test refusals 
from the hair testing program described in that subsection.

SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS.

    The Secretary of Transportation shall submit an annual report to 
Congress that--
            (1) summarizes the results of preemployment and random drug 
        testing using both hair testing and urinalysis;
            (2) evaluates the efficacy of each method; and
            (3) determines which method provides the most accurate 
        means of detecting the use of controlled substances over time.
