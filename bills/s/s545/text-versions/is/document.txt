United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Hydropower 
Improvement Act of 2013''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings.
Sec. 3. Definitions.
Sec. 4. Sense of the Senate on the use of hydropower renewable 
                            resources.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) hydropower is the largest source of clean, renewable 
        electricity in the United States;
            (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, hydropower 
        resources, including pumped storage facilities, provide--
                    (A) nearly 7 percent of the electricity generated 
                in the United States, avoiding approximately 
                200,000,000 metric tons of carbon emissions each year; 
                and
                    (B) approximately 100,000 megawatts of electric 
                capacity in the United States;
            (3) only 3 percent of the 80,000 dams in the United States 
        generate electricity so there is substantial potential for 
        adding hydropower generation to nonpower dams;
            (4) in every State, a tremendous untapped growth potential 
        exists in hydropower resources, including--
                    (A) efficiency improvements and capacity additions;
                    (B) adding generation to nonpower dams;
                    (C) conduit hydropower;
                    (D) conventional hydropower;
                    (E) pumped storage facilities; and
                    (F) new marine and hydrokinetic resources; and
            (5) improvements in increased hydropower production in the 
        United States have the potential--
                    (A) to increase the clean energy generation of the 
                United States;
                    (B) to improve project performance and result in 
                better environmental outcomes; and
                    (C) to provide ancillary benefits that include grid 
                reliability, energy storage, and integration services 
                for variable renewable resources.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Conduit.--The term ``conduit'' means any tunnel, canal, 
        pipeline, aqueduct, flume, ditch, or similar manmade water 
        conveyance that is operated for the distribution of water for 
        agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumption and not 
        primarily for the generation of electricity.
            (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of Energy.
            (3) Small hydroelectric power project.--The term ``small 
        hydroelectric power project'' has the meaning given the term in 
        section 4.30 of title 18, Code of Federal Regulations.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE USE OF HYDROPOWER RENEWABLE 
              RESOURCES.

    It is the sense of the Senate that the United States should 
increase substantially the capacity and generation of clean, renewable 
hydropower which will improve the environmental quality of resources in 
the United States and support local job creation and economic 
investment across the United States.

SEC. 5. PROMOTING HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT AT NONPOWERED DAMS AND CLOSED 
              LOOP PUMPED STORAGE PROJECTS.

    (a) In General.--To improve the regulatory process and reduce 
delays and costs for hydropower development at nonpowered dams and 
closed loop pumped storage projects, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (referred to in this section as the ``Commission'') shall 
investigate the feasibility of the issuance of a license for certain 
hydropower development during the 2-year period beginning on the date 
of commencement of the prefiling licensing process of the Commission 
(referred to in this section as a ``2-year process'').
    (b) Workshops and Pilots.--The Commission shall--
            (1) not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, hold an initial workshop to solicit public comment 
        and recommendations on how to implement a 2-year process;
            (2) develop criteria for identifying projects featuring 
        hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop 
        pumped storage projects that may be appropriate for licensing 
        within a 2-year process;
            (3) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, develop and implement pilot projects to test a 2-year 
        process, if practicable; and
            (4) not later than 3 years after the date of implementation 
        of any pilot project to test a 2-year process, hold a final 
        workshop to solicit public comment on the effectiveness of the 
        pilot project.
    (c) Memorandum of Understanding.--The Commission shall, to the 
maximum extent practicable, enter into a memorandum of understanding 
with any applicable Federal or State agency to implement a pilot 
project described in subsection (b).
    (d) Reports.--
            (1) Pilot projects not implemented.--If the Commission 
        determines that the pilot projects described in subsection (b) 
        are not practicable, not later than 240 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the 
        Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the 
        Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
        Representatives a report that--
                    (A) describes the public comments received as part 
                of the initial workshop held under subsection (b)(1); 
                and
                    (B) identifies the process, legal, environmental, 
                economic, and other issues that justify the 
                determination of the Commission that a 2-year process 
                is not practicable, with recommendations on how 
                Congress may address or remedy the identified issues.
            (2) Pilot projects implemented.--If the Commission develops 
        and implements pilot projects involving a 2-year process 
        described in subsection (b), not later than 60 days after the 
        date of completion of any final workshop held under subsection 
        (b)(4), the Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy 
        and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Energy 
        and Commerce of the House of Representatives a report that--
                    (A) describes the outcomes of the pilot projects;
                    (B) describes the public comments from the final 
                workshop on the effectiveness of the pilot projects; 
                and
                    (C)(i) outlines how the Commission will adopt 
                policies under existing law (including regulations) 
                that result in a 2-year process;
                    (ii) outlines how the Commission will proceed with 
                a rulemaking to adopt a 2-year process in the 
                regulations of the Commission; or
                    (iii) identifies the process, legal, environmental, 
                economic, and other issues that justify the 
                determination of the Commission that a 2-year process 
                is not practicable, with recommendations on how 
                Congress may address or remedy the identified issues.
