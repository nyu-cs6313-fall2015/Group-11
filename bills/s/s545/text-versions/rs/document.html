                                 A BILL


 
             To improve hydropower, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the 
``Hydropower Improvement Act of 2013''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act 
is as follows:&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
&lt;DELETED&gt;Sec. 2. Findings.
&lt;DELETED&gt;Sec. 3. Definitions.
&lt;DELETED&gt;Sec. 4. Sense of the Senate on the use of hydropower renewable 
                            resources.
&lt;DELETED&gt;Sec. 5. Promoting hydropower development at nonpowered dams

&lt;DELETED&gt;Sec. 10. Report on memorandum of understanding on hydropower.

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) hydropower is the largest source of clean, 
        renewable electricity in the United States;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, 
        hydropower resources, including pumped storage facilities, 
        provide--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) nearly 7 percent of the electricity 
                generated in the United States, avoiding approximately 
                200,000,000 metric tons of carbon emissions each year; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) approximately 100,000 megawatts of 
                electric capacity in the United States;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) only 3 percent of the 80,000 dams in the 
        United States generate electricity so there is substantial 
        potential for adding hydropower generation to nonpower 
        dams;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) in every State, a tremendous untapped growth 
        potential exists in hydropower resources, including--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) efficiency improvements and capacity 
                additions;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) adding generation to nonpower 
                dams;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) conduit hydropower;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) conventional hydropower;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) pumped storage facilities; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) new marine and hydrokinetic resources; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) improvements in increased hydropower 
        production in the United States have the potential--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) to increase the clean energy 
                generation of the United States;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) to improve project performance and 
                result in better environmental outcomes; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) to provide ancillary benefits that 
                include grid reliability, energy storage, and 
                integration services for variable renewable 
                resources.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    In this Act:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Conduit.--The term ``conduit'' means any 
        tunnel, canal, pipeline, aqueduct, flume, ditch, or similar 
        manmade water conveyance that is operated for the distribution 
        of water for agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumption 
        and not primarily for the generation of electricity.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the 
        Secretary of Energy.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Small hydroelectric power project.--The term 
        ``small hydroelectric power project'' has the meaning given the 
        term in section 4.30 of title 18, Code of Federal 
        Regulations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE USE OF HYDROPOWER RENEWABLE 
              RESOURCES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the sense of the Senate that the United States 
should increase substantially the capacity and generation of clean, 
renewable hydropower which will improve the environmental quality of 
resources in the United States and support local job creation and 
economic investment across the United States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 5. PROMOTING HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT AT NONPOWERED DAMS 
              AND CLOSED LOOP PUMPED STORAGE PROJECTS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--To improve the regulatory process and 
reduce delays and costs for hydropower development at nonpowered dams 
and closed loop pumped storage projects, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (referred to in this section as the ``Commission'') shall 
investigate the feasibility of the issuance of a license for certain 
hydropower development during the 2-year period beginning on the date 
of commencement of the prefiling licensing process of the Commission 
(referred to in this section as a ``2-year process'').&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Workshops and Pilots.--The Commission shall--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) not later than 60 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, hold an initial workshop to solicit 
        public comment and recommendations on how to implement a 2-year 
        process;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) develop criteria for identifying projects 
        featuring hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed 
        loop pumped storage projects that may be appropriate for 
        licensing within a 2-year process;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) not later than 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, develop and implement pilot projects to 
        test a 2-year process, if practicable; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) not later than 3 years after the date of 
        implementation of any pilot project to test a 2-year process, 
        hold a final workshop to solicit public comment on the 
        effectiveness of the pilot project.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Memorandum of Understanding.--The Commission shall, to 
the maximum extent practicable, enter into a memorandum of 
understanding with any applicable Federal or State agency to implement 
a pilot project described in subsection (b).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Reports.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Pilot projects not implemented.--If the 
        Commission determines that the pilot projects described in 
        subsection (b) are not practicable, not later than 240 days 
        after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall 
        submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the 
        Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
        Representatives a report that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) describes the public comments received 
                as part of the initial workshop held under subsection 
                (b)(1); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) identifies the process, legal, 
                environmental, economic, and other issues that justify 
                the determination of the Commission that a 2-year 
                process is not practicable, with recommendations on how 
                Congress may address or remedy the identified 
                issues.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Pilot projects implemented.--If the Commission 
        develops and implements pilot projects involving a 2-year 
        process described in subsection (b), not later than 60 days 
        after the date of completion of any final workshop held under 
        subsection (b)(4), the Commission shall submit to the Committee 
        on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee 
        on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives a report 
        that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) describes the outcomes of the pilot 
                projects;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) describes the public comments from the 
                final workshop on the effectiveness of the pilot 
                projects; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C)(i) outlines how the Commission will 
                adopt policies under existing law (including 
                regulations) that result in a 2-year process;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) outlines how the Commission will 
                proceed with a rulemaking to adopt a 2-year process in 
                the regulations of the Commission; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (iii) identifies the process, legal, 
                environmental, economic, and other issues that justify 
                the determination of the Commission that a 2-year 
                process is not practicable, with recommendations on how 
                Congress may address or remedy the identified

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Hydropower 
Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2013''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings.
Sec. 3. Promoting small hydroelectric power projects.
Sec. 4. Promoting conduit hydropower projects.
Sec. 5. FERC authority to extend preliminary permit periods.
Sec. 6. Promoting hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the hydropower industry currently employs approximately 
        300,000 workers across the United States;
            (2) hydropower is the largest source of clean, renewable 
        electricity in the United States;
            (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act, hydropower 
        resources, including pumped storage facilities, provide--
                    (A) nearly 7 percent of the electricity generated 
                in the United States; and
                    (B) approximately 100,000 megawatts of electric 
                capacity in the United States;
            (4) only 3 percent of the 80,000 dams in the United States 
        generate electricity, so there is substantial potential for 
        adding hydropower generation to nonpowered dams; and
            (5) according to one study, by utilizing currently untapped 
        resources, the United States could add approximately 60,000 
        megawatts of new hydropower capacity by 2025, which could 
        create 700,000 new jobs over the next 13 years.

SEC. 3. PROMOTING SMALL HYDROELECTRIC POWER PROJECTS.

    Subsection (d) of section 405 of the Public Utility Regulatory 
Policies Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2705) is amended by striking ``5,000''

once for not more than 2 additional years beyond the 3 years permitted 
by subsection (a) if the Commission finds that the permittee has 
carried out activities under such permit in good faith and with 
reasonable diligence.''.

SEC. 6. PROMOTING HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT AT NONPOWERED DAMS AND CLOSED 
              LOOP PUMPED STORAGE PROJECTS.

    (a) In General.--To improve the regulatory process and reduce 
delays and costs for hydropower development at nonpowered dams and 
closed loop pumped storage projects, the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission (referred to in this section as the ``Commission'') shall 
investigate the feasibility of the issuance of a license for hydropower 
development at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects 
in a 2-year period (referred to in this section as a ``2-year 
process''). Such a 2-year process shall include any prefiling licensing 
process of the Commission.
    (b) Workshops and Pilots.--The Commission shall--
            (1) not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, hold an initial workshop to solicit public comment 
        and recommendations on how to implement a 2-year process;
            (2) develop criteria for identifying projects featuring 
        hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop 
        pumped storage projects that may be appropriate for licensing 
        within a 2-year process;
            (3) not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, develop and implement pilot projects to test a 2-year 
        process, if practicable; and
            (4) not later than 3 years after the date of implementation 
        of the final pilot project testing a 2-year process, hold a 
        final workshop to solicit public comment on the effectiveness 
        of each tested 2-year process.
    (c) Memorandum of Understanding.--The Commission shall, to the 
extent practicable, enter into a memorandum of understanding with any 
applicable Federal or State agency to implement a pilot project 
described in subsection (b).
    (d) Reports.--
            (1) Pilot projects not implemented.--If the Commission 
        determines that no pilot project described in subsection (b) is 
        practicable because no 2-year process is practicable, not later 
        than 240 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
        Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
        of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and 
        Natural Resources of the Senate a report that--
                    (A) describes the public comments received as part 
                of the initial workshop held under subsection (b)(1); 
                and
                    (B) identifies the process, legal, environmental, 
                economic, and other issues that justify the 
                determination of the Commission that no 2-year process 
                is practicable, with recommendations on how Congress 
                may address or remedy the identified issues.
            (2) Pilot projects implemented.--If the Commission develops 
        and implements pilot projects involving a 2-year process, not 
        later than 60 days after the date of completion of the final 
        workshop held under subsection (b)(4), the Commission shall 
        submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural 
        Resources of the Senate a report that--
                    (A) describes the outcomes of the pilot projects;
                    (B) describes the public comments from the final 
                workshop on the effectiveness of each tested 2-year 
                process; and
                    (C)(i) outlines how the Commission will adopt 
                policies under existing law (including regulations) 
                that result in a 2-year process for appropriate 
                projects;
                    (ii) outlines how the Commission will issue new 
                regulations to adopt a 2-year process for appropriate 
                projects; or
                    (iii) identifies the process, legal, environmental, 
                economic, and other issues that justify a determination 
                of the Commission that no 2-year process is 
                practicable, with recommendations on how Congress may 
                address or remedy the identified issues.

SEC. 7. DOE STUDY OF PUMPED STORAGE AND POTENTIAL HYDROPOWER FROM 
              CONDUITS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy shall conduct a study--
            (1)(A) of the technical flexibility that existing pumped 
        storage facilities can provide to support intermittent 
        renewable electric energy generation, including the potential 
        for such existing facilities to be upgraded or retrofitted with 
        advanced commercially available technology; and
            (B) of the technical potential of existing pumped storage 
        facilities and new advanced pumped storage facilities, to 
        provide grid reliability benefits; and
            (2)(A) to identify the range of opportunities for 
        hydropower that may be obtained from conduits (as defined by 
        the Secretary) in the United States; and
            (B) through case studies, to assess amounts of potential 
        energy generation from such conduit hydropower projects.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report that describes 
the results of the study conducted under subsection (a), including any 
recommendations.
