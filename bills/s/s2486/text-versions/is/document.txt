                    ``(A) beginning 1 year after the first day of the

        comparing such Consumer Price Index for the most recent month, 
        quarter, or year available (as selected by the Secretary prior 
        to the first year for which a minimum wage is in effect 
        pursuant to this subsection) with such Consumer Price Index for 
        the same month in the preceding year, the same quarter in the

        compensated employee (as such term is defined and delimited by 
        the Secretary), then the level of total annual compensation 
        necessary for such exemption shall be--
                    (A) beginning 1 year after the first day of the 
                first month that begins after the date of enactment of

                        under this paragraph on the day before the date 
                        of such adjustment;

                        annual percentage increase in the Consumer 
                        Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical 
                        Workers; and

            (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection or 
        the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under 
        this subsection shall override any provision of a collective 
        bargaining agreement that provides for overtime employment 
        compensation, or rights to such compensation, that exceed the

        added by subsection (a), or any adjustment in the amount of 
        compensation required for the highly compensated employee 
        exemption required under subsection (b), the Secretary of Labor 
        shall publish, in the Federal Register and on the website of 
        the Department of Labor, a notice announcing the adjusted
