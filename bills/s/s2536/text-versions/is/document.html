        Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States;
            (2) this Act and the amendments made by this Act are 
        enacted as an exercise of the authority of Congress to enforce 
        the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
        States by appropriate legislation;
            (3) this Act and the amendments made by this Act are also 
        enacted as an exercise of the authority of Congress under the 
        commerce clause of section 8 of article I of the Constitution 
        of the United States to regulate, by appropriate legislation, 
        the instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce, as 
        well as that which directly and materially affects interstate 
        and foreign commerce; and
            (4) this Act and the amendments made by this Act should be 
        liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes to the 
        full extent permitted by the First Amendment to the 
        Constitution of the United States, including the commercial 
        speech doctrine.
