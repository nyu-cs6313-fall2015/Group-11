    "text": "Advanced Clean Coal Technology Investment in Our Nation Act of 2014 or the ACCTION Act of 2014 - Amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the Department of Energy (DOE) to implement a program to demonstrate the integration of systems for the capture, transportation, and injection of carbon dioxide from industrial sources for long-term geological storage or enhanced oil recovery at a commercial scale.\n\nExpands the types of activities that must be undertaken under the existing coal and related technologies program. Permits DOE to carry out a Transformational Coal Technology Program.\n\nRequires DOE to establish an advisory committee to report on the carbon capture and sequestration program and the coal and related technologies program.\n\nMakes projects under the Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program eligible to receive other forms of federal assistance. Directs DOE, within two years, to give final approval to applications for loan guarantees and make loans for advanced fossil energy technology projects under the Program.\n\nSets forth provisions to streamline and expedite review of federal authorizations for clean coal generating projects.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) allow accelerated amortization of any mechanical or electronic system which is installed on a coal-fired electric generation unit and which reduces carbon dioxide emissions by specified means; (2) allow a new credit for investment in carbon dioxide capture, transport, and storage property; and (3) create a clean energy coal bond.\n\nEstablishes the Enhanced Recovery Program, a variable price support program, to accelerate the construction and operation of advanced coal-fueled projects that capture carbon dioxide emissions and sell or use the carbon dioxide for enhanced recovery."
