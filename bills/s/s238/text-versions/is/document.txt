            TITLE I--SINGLE MANDATE FOR PRICE STABILITY ACT

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Monetary policy can only affect the level of employment 
        in the short term because nonmonetary factors determine the 
        level of employment in the long term. At best, the Federal 
        Reserve may temporarily increase the level of employment 
        through monetary policy, but such efforts risk the possibility 
        of price inflation and increased business cycle volatility in 
        the future. However, the Federal Reserve can achieve price 
        stability in the long term through monetary policy. Price 
        stability is desirable because both price inflation and price 
        deflation damage the U.S. economy. Therefore, to maximize long-
        term economic growth and achieve the highest sustainable level 
        of real output and employment, price stability should be the 
        objective of monetary policy.
            (2) Countries whose central bank has a single mandate for 
        price stability generally have a better record of achieving 
        stable prices than countries whose central bank has a mandate 
        that gives equal weight to other objectives such as maximum 
        employment or low interest rates.
            (3) In general, an overly accommodative monetary policy 
        inflates both asset prices and prices for goods and services. 
        However, an overly accommodative monetary policy may sometimes 
        cause a misallocation of capital that inflates asset prices 
        disproportionately, creating unsustainable bubbles in asset 
        prices, while price indices for goods and services do not 
        register significant price inflation. When asset bubbles burst, 
        many investments must be liquidated at considerable cost to the 
        U.S. economy in terms of lower real output and employment.
            (4) Price stability cannot always be measured solely 
        through price indices for goods and services since such indices 
        exclude changes in asset prices. Therefore, the Federal Reserve 
        should monitor (A) the prices of, and the expected returns 
        from, major asset classes (including equities, residential real 
        estate, commercial and industrial real estate, agricultural 
        real estate, gold and other commodities, corporate bonds, U.S. 
        Government bonds, State and local government bonds, and other 
        securities), (B) the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other 
        currencies, and (C) the value of the United States dollar 
        relative to gold, as metrics to determine whether the Federal 
        Reserve's monetary policy is consistent with long-term price 
        stability.

    (a) In General.--Section 2A of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 
225a) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``goals of maximum employment, stable 
        prices, and moderate long-term interest rates'' and inserting 
        ``goal of long-term price stability'';
            (2) by striking ``The Board of Governors'' and inserting 
        the following:
    ``(a) In General.--The Board of Governors''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:

                for purposes of subsection (a); and
                    ``(B) establish metrics that the Board and the 
                Committee will use to evaluate whether long-term price

                goods and services; and

                        comprehensively reflecting price movements in 
                        the economy; and
                            ``(ii) whether any price movements not 
                        captured by the price indices of goods and 
                        services are causing a significant 
                        misallocation of capital in the United States 
                        economy.

                agricultural real estate, commodities, corporate bonds, 
                State and local government bonds, and other securities)

        term price stability; and''.

     TITLE II--FINANCIAL STABILITY AND MORAL HAZARD MITIGATION ACT

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Reserve performs an essential function for 
        financial stability by serving as lender of last resort in 
        order to--
                    (A) prevent the unnecessary failures of otherwise 
                solvent United States banks and other financial 
                institutions;
                    (B) reduce the likelihood of financial contagion 
                and disruptions in United States financial markets; and
                    (C) minimize any adverse effects on real output and 
                employment in the United States economy.
            (2) In acting as the lender of last resort, the Federal 
        Reserve, may--
                    (A) buy debt securities at fair market value; or
                    (B) provide short-term credit, secured by 
                appropriate collateral in proper margin, to otherwise 
                solvent banks and other financial institutions that 
                encounter funding difficulties during a financial 
                crisis.
            (3) Nevertheless, in its nearly 100-year history, the 
        Federal Reserve has never clearly articulated its lender-of-
        last-resort policy.
            (4) The absence of an official lender-of-last-resort policy 
        has led to--
                    (A) increased economic uncertainty because no one 
                knows with certainty how the Federal Reserve may 
                behave;
                    (B) financially distressed firms seeking political 
                solutions in the form of pressure from Congress or the 
                Administration being placed on the Federal Reserve to 
                act to save them; and
                    (C) a moral hazard problem from financial 
                institutions taking greater risks and increasing 
                leverage based upon assumptions of how the Federal 
                Reserve will act, though there is no formal statement 
                assuring how the Federal Reserve will act.
            (5) By establishing a formal lender-of-last-resort policy, 
        the Federal Reserve would decrease uncertainty in the market 
        during times of financial crisis and mitigate the moral hazards 
        created by recent bailouts.
            (6) An official lender-of-last-resort policy should provide 
        that once a financial crisis has dissipated, the Federal 
        Reserve should, in an orderly way, sell any debt securities 
        that--
                    (A) the Federal Reserve acquired acting as lender 
                of last resort; and
                    (B) the Federal Reserve does not normally own for 
                its System Account.
            (7) Further, to reduce moral hazard, the Federal Reserve's 
        lender-of-last-resort policy should make clear that credit in 
        any form will not be provided to insolvent banks or other 
        financial institution.

SEC. 202. LENDER-OF-LAST-RESORT POLICY.

    (a) In General.--Not later than the end of the 1-year period 
beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall clearly articulate the 
Board's lender-of-last-resort policy.
    (b) Consultation.--In articulating the policy required under 
subsection (a), the Board of Governors shall consult with--
            (1) the Federal Reserve bank presidents;
            (2) the Comptroller of the Currency;
            (3) the Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
        Corporation;
            (4) the Securities and Exchange Commission;
            (5) the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and
            (6) such other persons with expertise in financial services 
        regulation and monetary policy as the Board of Governors may 
        determine appropriate.

TITLE III--DIVERSIFYING THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE TO REFLECT A 
                        21ST CENTURY ECONOMY ACT

SEC. 301. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal Reserve Act delineates specific 
        requirements for the seven governors charged with oversight of 
        the Federal Reserve System.
            (2) In a reflection of the Federal Reserve System's 
        decentralized structure that broadly distributes power and 
        responsibility across the Nation, the Act mandates that the 
        presidentially appointed governors come from a wide range of 
        geographic locations and professional backgrounds. 
        Specifically, the first undesignated paragraph under section 10 
        of the Federal Reserve Act states that ``In selecting the 
        members of the Board, not more than one of whom shall be 
        selected from any one Federal Reserve District, the President 
        shall have due regard to a fair representation of the 
        financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests 
        and geographical divisions of the country.''.
            (3) The Federal Open Monetary Committee consists of members 
        of the Board of Governors and the President or Vice President 
        of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on a permanent basis 
        and rotates voting membership among the remaining Regional 
        Reserve Banks.
            (4) The existing structure of the Federal Open Market 
        Committee places too much authority in the hands of Washington 
        and New York at the expense of the remainder of the United 
        States.
            (5) Monetary policy should be conducted in the interest of 
        all Americans and that policy goal is best achieved by a 
        Federal Open Market Committee that provides greater 
        representation and voice in policy decisions to the entire 
        Nation as represented by the Regional Reserve Banks. This 
        objective is best achieved by reforming the voting membership 
        of the Federal Open Market Committee to include all Regional 
        Reserve Banks on a permanent basis.

SEC. 302. FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP.

    Section 12A(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 263(a)) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``five representatives of the Federal 
        Reserve banks to be selected as hereinafter provided.'' and 
        inserting ``1 representative from each of the Federal Reserve 
        banks.''; and
            (2) by striking ``and, beginning with the election for the 
        term commencing March 1, 1943, shall be elected annually as 
        follows: One by the board of directors of the Federal Reserve 
        Bank of New York, one by the boards of directors of the Federal 
        Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, and Richmond, one by the 
        boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland 
        and Chicago, one by the boards of directors of the Federal 
        Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Dallas, and St. Louis, and one by the 
        boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of 
        Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. In such elections 
        each board of directors shall have one vote; and the details of 
        such elections may be governed by regulations prescribed by the 
        committee, which may be amended from time to time.'' and 
        inserting ``and shall be elected by the board of directors of 
        the Federal Reserve bank that they are to represent.''.

       TITLE IV--DEMYSTIFICATION OF MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS ACT

SEC. 401. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) A more efficient release of transcripts from the 
        Federal Reserve would result in better guidance for market 
        participants, and hence more economically efficient decision 
        making.
            (2) According to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, 
        ``when the monetary policy committee regularly provides 
        information about objectives, economic outlook, and policy 
        plans, two benefits result: (1) markets will price assets more 
        efficiently, and (2) a closer alignment between market 
        participants' expectations about the course of future short-
        term interest rates and'' the views of policymakers.
            (3) The Federal Reserve is able to release transcripts more 
        efficiently without compromising their decision making process.

SEC. 402. RELEASE OF TRANSCRIPTS.

    Section 12A(a) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 263(a)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(d) Release of Transcripts.--The Committee shall release meeting 
transcripts to the public not later than the end of the 3-year period 
following each meeting.''.

               TITLE V--EXCHANGE RATE RESPONSIBILITY ACT

SEC. 501. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
        and the Federal Open Market Committee exercise control over the 
        supply of U.S. dollars, which is a major factor affecting the 
        foreign exchange rate value of the United States dollar. 
        Therefore, the Board of Governors and Federal Open Market 
        Committee should report to Congress on the impact of monetary 
        policy on the foreign exchange rate value of the United States 
        dollar.
            (2) Over the last several decades, Secretaries of the 
        Treasury have repeatedly used the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
        for purposes that were not envisioned by Congress. To prevent 
        further abuses, the Exchange Stabilization Fund should be 
        renamed as the Special Drawing Rights Fund. The Special Drawing 
        Rights Fund should hold the Special Drawing Rights that the 
        International Monetary Fund provided to the United States. Any 
        other assets currently in the Exchange Stabilization Fund 
        should be liquidated, and the proceeds used to reduce the 
        public debt.

SEC. 502. REPORT ON THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE POLICY.

    Section 2B(b) of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended by section 
102(b), is further amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(5) an analysis of how the policies of the Board and the 
        Federal Open Market Committee are affecting the foreign 
        exchange rate value of the United States dollar.''.

SEC. 503. RENAMING OF EXCHANGE STABILIZATION FUND.

    (a) In General.--Section 5302 of title 31, United States Code, is 
amended by striking ``stabilization fund'' each place such term appears 
and inserting ``Special Drawing Rights Fund''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--
            (1) Balanced budget and emergency deficit control act of 
        1985.--Section 255(g)(1)(A) of the Balanced Budget and 
        Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 905(g)(1)(A))

                Stabilization Fund'' each place such term appears in 
                headings and text and inserting ``Special Drawing 
                Rights Fund''; and
                    (B) in the item relating to section 131 in the 
                table of contents of such Act, by striking ``Exchange 
                Stabilization Fund'' and inserting ``Special Drawing 
                Rights Fund''.
            (3) International financial institutions act.--Section 1704 
        of the International Financial Institutions Act (22 U.S.C. 
        262r-3) is amended by striking ``stabilization fund'' each 
        place such term appears and inserting ``Special Drawing Rights 
        Fund''.
            (4) Special drawing rights act.--The Special Drawing Rights 
        Act (22 U.S.C. 286n et seq.) is amended by striking ``Exchange 
        Stabilization Fund'' each place such term appears and inserting

    (c) References.--Any reference in a law, regulation, document, 
paper, or other record of the United States to the ``Exchange 
Stabilization Fund'' shall be deemed a reference to the ``Special 
Drawing Rights Fund''.

SEC. 504. CONVERSION TO ALL-SDR FUND.

     TITLE VII--BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION FUNDING ACT

SEC. 701. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) As our Nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve 
        conducts United States monetary policy and necessarily 
        exercises broad oversight responsibility to ensure the safety, 
        soundness, and smooth functioning of the Nation's banking and 
        payments systems.
            (2) There exists a broad consensus among policymakers, 
        academics, and most informed commentators that central bank 
        independence is necessary to the proper and effective conduct 
        of monetary policy and those regulatory activities necessary 
        for the implementation of such monetary policy.
            (3) In order to preserve the independence of its 
        activities, the Federal Reserve should remain operationally and 
        financially autonomous within the United States Government.
            (4) However, those activities that do not relate to the 
        functions listed in paragraph (1) should not occur outside of 
        the constitutionally granted authority of Congress to authorize 
        and oversee the expenditure of public funds.
            (5) Therefore, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection 
        should be subject to the Federal appropriations process to 
        ensure effective Congressional oversight over its activities 
        and use of public funds.

SEC. 702. BUREAU OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION FUNDING.

    (a) In General.--Section 1017 of the Consumer Financial Protection 
Act of 2010 (12 U.S.C. 5497) is amended--

                Audit.--'';

        (b) and (c), respectively; and
            (4) in subsection (c), as so redesignated--
                    (A) by striking paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) and 
                inserting the following:
            ``(1) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized 
        to be appropriated such funds as may be necessary to carry out 
        this title.''; and
