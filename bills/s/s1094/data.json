    "text": "Strengthening America's Schools Act of 2013 - Revises and reauthorizes programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA).\n\n Title I: College and Career Readiness for All Students - Part A: Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged - (Sec. 1111) Revises the school improvement program under part A of title I of the ESEA.\n\nMaintains the requirement conditioning a state's receipt of funds under part A on its developing and implementing academic content and achievement standards and assessments that are applicable to all public elementary and secondary schools and school students in the state.\n\nRequires states to adopt college and career ready academic: (1) content standards in reading or language arts and mathematics by the end of 2014, and (2) achievement standards in those disciplines by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year.\n\nRequires college and career ready standards to be aligned with: (1) credit-bearing academic coursework at public institutions of higher education (IHEs) in the state, (2) relevant state career and technical education standards and the state performance measures identified in the state plan for career and technical education, and (3) appropriate career skills or state-developed standards that are voluntarily adopted by a significant number of states.\n\nRequires the achievement standards to establish the level of performance expected for each grade level that demonstrates that the student has mastered the material in the state academic content standards for that grade level.\n\nRequires states to adopt academic content and achievement standards in science by the end of 2014 that are aligned with the knowledge and skills needed to be college and career ready.\n\nRequires states to adopt, by the close of 2015, high-quality English language proficiency standards that: (1) identify at least four levels of English proficiency, and (2) are aligned with their academic content standards in reading or language arts so that students can be reliably measured in those disciplines. Requires English learners (currently referred to as limited English proficient students) to be tested against those proficiency standards on an annual basis.\n\nAllows states to adopt alternate academic achievement standards and assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities. Requires the decision about which students should be measured against these standards to be made separately for each student in each subject assessed. Prohibits the number of students in a state who are being assessed in each grade level for each subject using the alternate assessment from exceeding 1% of the number of all students in that grade level in the state being assessed in that subject matter.\n\nDirects states that use school improvement funds to support early childhood education to establish, or certify the existence of, early learning guidelines for preschool-aged children and early grade standards for children in kindergarten through grade three by the close of 2015.\n\nRequires states, by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year, to adopt and implement statewide assessments that measure student achievement against: (1) the reading or language arts and mathematics standards annually in grades 3 through 8 and at least once during grades 10 through 12; and (2) the science standards at least once in grades 3 through 5, 6 through 9, and 10 through 12; (3) the English language proficiency standards; and (4) any alternate academic achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.\n\nRequires the assessments in reading or language arts, mathematics, and science to: (1) measure whether each student is performing at the student's grade level, (2) determine the specific grade level at which each student is performing, and (3) measure each student's academic growth.\n\nAllows states to develop and administer computer adaptive assessments for those subjects.\n\nAllows the assessments in reading or language arts and mathematics to be administered through a single annual summative assessment or through multiple assessments during an academic year, provided the multiple assessments yield a summative score that reliably measures student academic growth.\n\nRequires states to reduce duplicative assessments.\n\nRequires each state receiving part A funds to prepare and disseminate an annual report card on the performance of each public elementary and secondary school in the state, each local educational agency (LEA) in the state, and the state as a whole. Requires the report cards to include: (1) specified student information in the aggregate and disaggregated and cross-tabulated by student subgroup, (2) class size information, (3) information on each school's categorization under the state accountability system, (4) school sports information, and (5) information on the number of students using early intervening services.\n\nRequires LEAs to issue report cards that contain specified student information disaggregated by student subgroup.\n\nRequires LEAs to provide parents with an equity report card for each school that includes: (1) student achievement data, disaggregated by student subgroup; (2) information on the school's funding by source; (3) for each high school, the graduation rate and the rate students enroll in college; (4) information on student participation in educational opportunities at the school; and (5) school climate information.\n\n(Sec. 1113) Alters the formula LEAs are to use to: (1) rank the poverty of school attendance areas if school improvement funds are insufficient to serve all areas, and (2) calculate the number of low-income students in secondary schools.\n\nRequires LEAs to reserve part A funds to serve homeless and foster care children. Allows reserved funds to be used to provide homeless children and youth with services not ordinarily provided to other children under part A.\n\n(Sec. 1114) Amends provisions concerning schoolwide programs (programs that allow LEAs to consolidate school improvement funds to upgrade the entire educational program of schools) to allow the delivery of those programs by external providers that have expertise in using scientifically valid strategies and programs to improve teaching, learning, and schools.\n\nRequires schoolwide programs to include reform strategies that provide: (1) a multi-tier system of supports and positive behavioral interventions and supports; and (2) programs, activities, courses, and professional development in the core academic subjects that are targeted toward assisting low-performing or at-risk children in meeting the academic content and achievement standards.\n\n(Sec. 1115) Allows targeted assistance programs (programs that direct school improvement funds toward the children in a school who are failing or most at risk of failing) to include: (1) a multi-tier system of supports and positive behavioral interventions and supports; and (2) support for programs, activities, courses, and professional development in the core academic subjects that are targeted toward assisting those children in meeting the academic content and achievement standards.\n\n(Sec. 1116) Eliminates the requirement that LEAs and their elementary and secondary schools make adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward state performance standards or be subject to specified improvements, corrective action, or restructuring. Requires, instead, that each state accountability system:\n\n establish annual performance targets for the state and its LEAs and elementary and secondary schools that include targets for student proficiency, academic growth, English language proficiency for English learners, and high school graduation rates; use the assessments and high school graduation rates to annually measure and report on the performance of the state's elementary and secondary schools and LEAs; and require the improvement, through supports and interventions that address student needs, of all of the state's public schools that are low-performing or have low-performing subgroups of poor, minority, disabled, and English learner students. Requires state accountability systems to include student performance in reading or language arts and mathematics. Allows states to include other subjects, such as science, for which they have adopted academic content and achievement standards.\n\nRequires LEAs to ensure that each school that, after two consecutive years, has not met state performance targets for the same student subgroup develops and implements a locally designed intervention to improve student achievement in that subgroup.\n\nSubjects schools to improvement strategies if they are identified as: (1) focus schools due to their having among the largest achievement or graduation gaps among student subgroups in the state; or (2) priority schools due to their status as the lowest achieving schools in the state, high schools with graduation rates below 60%, or focus schools for the six preceding consecutive years.\n\nIdentifies a school as a focus school, beginning with the 2015-2016 school year, if it is not identified as a priority school and is in the 10% of all: (1) public schools in the state with the greatest achievement gaps among the subgroups of poor, minority, disabled, and English learner students; or (2) public high schools in the state with the greatest graduation rate gaps among those student subgroups.\n\nRequires each LEA that serves a focus school to develop and implement a measurable and data-driven correction plan to improve the performance of the school's low-achieving subgroups.\n\nContinues a focus school's characterization as a focus school for the three years following its designation as such, unless it meets all of its performance targets or the state determines, after the second year, that it will meet those targets by the end of the following year.\n\nAllows states to apply to the Secretary of Education (Secretary) for a waiver of the requirement to identify schools as focus schools if they determine that all of their schools that would be identified as such are performing at a satisfactory level.\n\nIdentifies a school as a priority school, beginning with the 2015-2016 school year, if it: (1) is in the lowest-achieving 5% of elementary schools in the state, (2) is in the lowest-achieving 5% of secondary schools in the state, (3) is a public high school with a graduation rate of less than 60%, or (4) has been a focus school for the six preceding consecutive years.\n\nAllows states to apply to the Secretary for a waiver of the requirement to identify schools as priority schools due to their being within the lowest-achieving 5% of elementary or 5% of secondary schools if they determine that all of those schools are performing at a satisfactory level.\n\nAuthorizes a state, state law permitting, to take over a school and act as its LEA if the school has been identified as a priority school for the initial three-year identification period and is then re-identified as a priority school for a subsequent three-year period.\n\nRequires LEAs receiving part A funds to conduct a data-driven needs analysis of each of their priority schools and use it to select and implement the most appropriate school improvement strategy to improve student performance at each school.\n\nRequires LEAs that are implementing any of the school improvement strategies to provide: (1) school staff with ongoing training and performance evaluations; (2) students with instruction and instructional supports that meet their individual needs; and (3) the school with assistance in implementing positive behavioral interventions and supports, other early intervening services, and school based mental-health programs.\n\nIdentifies the school improvement strategies as: (1) the transformation strategy, (2) the turnaround strategy, (3) the whole school reform strategy, (4) the restart strategy, and (5) the school closure strategy.\n\nIncludes as part of the transformation strategy: (1) replacing the principal, if the principal has served in that role at the school for more than two years, with a principal that has had more training, experience, or success; (2) requiring instructional and leadership personnel to reapply for their positions; (3) requiring hiring at the school to be done through mutual consent; and (4) implementing schedules and strategies that provide increased learning time.\n\n Includes as part of the turnaround strategy: (1) replacing the principal, if the principal has served in that role at the school for more than two years, with a principal that has had more training, experience, or success; (2) screening all teachers in the school and retaining not more than 65% of them; and (3) implementing schedules and strategies the provide increased learning time.\n\nIdentifies the whole school reform strategy as one undertaken in partnership with an external provider offering a school reform program that is based on at least a moderate level of evidence that it will have a statistically significant effect on student outcomes.\n\n Includes as part of the restart strategy: (1) converting the school into a public charter, magnet, or innovative school;
