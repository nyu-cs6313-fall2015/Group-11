Housing Finance Reform and Taxpayer Protection Act of 2014 - Title I: Elimination of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - (Section 101) Directs the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation (FMIC ) established under title II of this Act to take all steps necessary to dissolve and eliminate the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). Revokes the charters for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (government sponsored enterprises [GSEs]).

Title II: Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation - (Sec. 201) Establishes the FMIC as an independent agency and instrumentality of the federal government to:

 facilitate a liquid, transparent, and resilient single-family and multifamily mortgage credit market by supporting a robust secondary mortgage market; provide insurance on any mortgage-backed security that satisfies requirements to become a covered security; monitor and supervise approved entities; supervise regulated entities; ensure continued, widespread availability of an affordable, long-term, fixed rate, prepayable mortgage, such as a 30-year fixed rate mortgage; and preserve and maintain a liquid forward execution market for eligible single-family mortgage loans and single-family covered securities, such as the To-Be-Announced market. Gives the FMIC general regulatory authority over each regulated entity (Fannie Mae and affiliates, Freddie Mac and affiliates, any Federal Home Loan Bank, and the Securitization Platform established under title III subtitle C part I) and the Office of Finance in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.

Prohibits the FMIC from engaging in mortgage loan origination.

(Sec. 202) Vests the management of the FMIC in a Board of Directors consisting of five members be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

(Sec. 203) Directs the FMIC to establish an Advisory Committee to advise the Office of Consumer and Market Access and the Board of Directors on developments in the primary and secondary mortgage markets that have material effects on the ongoing mission of the FMIC.

(Sec. 204) Establishes the Office of Inspector General in the FMIC, headed by an Inspector General appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.

(Sec. 207) Directs the FMIC to establish an Office of Underwriting, an Office of Securitization, and an Office of Federal Home Loan Bank Supervision.

Transfers to the Office of Federal Home Loan Bank Supervision, six months after enactment of this Act, all functions of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) relating to: (1) the supervision of the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and (2) all related FHFA rulemaking authority.

(Sec. 208) Directs the FMIC to establish an Office of Consumer and Market Access to:

 administer the Market Access Fund; monitor the national, regional, and area single-family and multifamily housing finance markets to identify underserved markets, communities, and consumers in accordance with market segments; inform market participants of business practices and technical assistance regarding the housing needs of consumers in underserved communities; and study incentives to encourage mortgage lenders and mortgage originators to address the housing needs of underserved markets and communities. (Sec. 209) Directs the FMIC to establish an Office of Multifamily Housing to develop, adopt, and publish specific criteria to ensure that eligible multifamily mortgage loans that collateralize multifamily covered securities insured under this Act comply with its requirements.

(Sec. 210) Directs the FMIC to seek to support the primary mortgage market for eligible mortgage loans on an equitable, nondiscriminatory, and non-exclusionary basis to help ensure that all eligible borrowers have access to mortgage credit.

Requires the FMIC, by regulation, to identify and define up to eight segments of the primary mortgage market in which lenders and eligible borrowers lack equitable access to the housing finance system facilitated by the FMIC.

Authorizes the FMIC to:

 review approved credit risk-sharing mechanisms to determine whether they continue to satisfy the considerations for approval, assess the functioning of the forward market for eligible single-family mortgage loans and single-family covered securities, suspend approval of any credit risk-sharing mechanism that does not satisfy the considerations for approval or has adversely affected the liquidity or resiliency of the forward market, develop an expedited process for reinstating the approval of any suspended credit risk-sharing mechanism; consider for approval additional fully-funded risk sharing mechanisms; and establish collateral diversification standards. Exempts from the Commodity Exchange Act certain credit risk-sharing mechanisms designed or used by a private market holder to assume losses and reduce the specific risks arising from losses realized under the mechanism associated with any insured single-family covered security.

(Sec. 305) Authorizes the FMIC for a six-month period, when unusual and exigent circumstances have created or threaten to create an anomalous lack of credit availability within the single-family, multifamily, or entire U.S housing market that could materially and severely disrupt the functioning of the U.S. housing finance system, to: (1) provide insurance to any single-family covered security regardless of whether that security has satisfied standards for credit risk-sharing mechanisms, and (2) establish provisional standards for approved entities.

Prohibits the FMIC from: (1) bailing out any approved entity (or affiliate) in bankruptcy or any other federal or state insolvency proceeding, or (2) assisting a single and specific company to avoid bankruptcy or any federal or state insolvency proceeding.

Directs the FMIC to establish a timeline for approved entities to meet approval standards, and:

Gives the FMIC the authority to respond to a sustained national home price decline.

(Sec. 306) Sets forth general powers of the FMIC.

(Sec. 307) Deems all securities insured or guaranteed by the FMIC to be exempt from regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Amends the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Act of 1934 to exempt covered securities insured or guaranteed by the FMIC or any institution that is subject to the FMIC supervision from credit risk retention requirements.

(Sec. 308) Authorizes the FMIC to consult and share information with, and requires it to coordinate with, specified federal regulatory agencies in carrying out any duty, responsibility, requirement, or action authorized under this Act.
