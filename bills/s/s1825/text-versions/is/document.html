                                 A BILL


 
   To improve the management of the Job Corps program, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Job Corps Centers Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Department of Labor's management of the Job Corps 
        program has recently suffered from poor budgeting and financial 
        management. The Office of Inspector General of the Department 
        of Labor found that the Department had projected costs 
        erroneously and managerial factors exacerbated the resulting 
        budget shortfalls.
            (2) For nearly 50 years, the Job Corps program was overseen 
        by a single individual appointed to a position in the Senior 
        Executive Service. The management structure for the program has 
        expanded to include 3 positions in the Senior Executive 
        Service. This expansion has not contributed to better 
        management of the program but has created uncertainty about 
        roles and responsibilities, according to the May 31, 2013, 
        report by the Office of Inspector General.
            (3) The Department of Labor has not been sufficiently 
        transparent with Congress regarding policies that significantly 
        affect constituents, particularly decisions to suspend 
        enrollments or reduce the number of enrollees the Job Corps 
        program serves.
            (4) An advisory board of Job Corps operational experts can 
        assist the new leadership of the Department of Labor as the 
        Department--
                    (A) addresses the structural challenges the Job 
                Corps program faces in its administration; and
                    (B) returns the program to the administrative and 
                operational efficiency that characterized the program's 
                first 50 years.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) local Job Corps center operational experts should play 
        an important role in ensuring the effective management by the 
        Secretary of the Job Corps program, by informing the Office of 
        Job Corps on the impact Federal decisions may have on Job Corps 
        campuses;
            (2) the Job Corps program continues to produce results as 
        the economy of the United States recovers and unemployment 
        remains high, as more than 85 percent of Job Corps graduates 
        obtain a job, enroll in higher education, or enlist in the 
        military upon completion; and
            (3) the 125 Job Corps center campuses, which includes 
        locations in nearly every State, have compiled an impressive 
        record of preparing at-risk youth for the workforce or higher 
        education, and in nearly 50 years, more than 3,000,000 youth 
        have obtained, through the Job Corps program, the job and 
        social skills needed to start a career or obtain further 
        educational credentials.
