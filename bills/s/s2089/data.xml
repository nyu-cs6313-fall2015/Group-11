  <summary>3/6/2014--Introduced.
Supplemental Security Income Restoration Act of 2014 - Amends title XVI (Supplemental Security Income) (SSI) of the Social Security Act to increase from $240 to $1,320 (increased for inflation each calendar year after 2015) the first amount of general income per year excluded in determining SSI program eligibility.

Increases from: (1) $780 to $4,284 (similarly increased) the first amount of earned income similarly excluded (including for a blind or disabled individual [or spouse] under age 65), (2) $3,000 to $15,000 in calendar year 2015 (increased for inflation) the resource limit for couples, and (3) $2,000 to $10,000 in calendar year 2015 (similarly increased) for individuals without a spouse.

Prescribes an inflation adjustment in benefits in any calendar year after 2015.

Removes support and maintenance furnished in kind from determination of unearned income.

Repeals the administrative penalty that renders individuals (and spouses) ineligible for SSI for a certain period of time if after the look-back date (usually 36 months preceding their application for SSI) they dispose of their resources for less than market value.</summary>
