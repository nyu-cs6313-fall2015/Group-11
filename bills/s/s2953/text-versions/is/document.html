SEC. 3. TEMPORARY BAN ON VISAS FOR RESIDENTS OF COUNTRIES WITH

                    (A) In general.--A covered alien is ineligible to

                present in the United States, departed the United 
                States and visited a designated country, and is seeking 
                to reenter the United States.
                    (B) Revocation of visa.--Beginning on the date of 
                the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall 
                revoke the visa of each covered alien described in 
                subparagraph (A).
    (b) Exception for Aid Workers.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to

            (2) does not depart the United States during the term of 
        that visa.

SEC. 4. REPORTS.

    Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act,

Act are in effect, the President shall submit to Congress a report on 
the spread of the Ebola virus. Each such report shall include--

        situation since the last report; and
            (3) the reasons that a complete ban on travel to and from 
        designated countries would not be in the national interest of 
        the United States.

is 60 days after the date the Director certifies that there are no
