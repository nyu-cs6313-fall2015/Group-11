Requires the Secretary of State to revoke the visa of each covered alien.\n\nExempts from such coverage and requirements: (1) certain aid workers, and (2) persons authorized by the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to travel to the United States for training.\n\nDirects the President to report to Congress every 30 days regarding the spread of Ebola."
