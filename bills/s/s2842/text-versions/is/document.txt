                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a Caregiver Corps 
                                program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Caregiver Corps Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) As of 2013, more than 43,000,000 Americans are age 65 
        or older. More than 75 percent of such individuals live with 
        chronic conditions which require assistance that helps them to 
        live in a home- or community-based setting. In 2012, almost 
        38,000,000 Americans of all ages reported having one or more 
        disabilities.
            (2) As of 2012, there were over 800,000 home health aides 
        assisting older adults in their homes with activities of daily 
        living and some light housekeeping tasks such as changing 
        linens and preparing food. Direct care workers are critical as 
        families and friends strive to provide quality care for 
        individuals in the community.
            (3) Estimates suggest that there are 52,000,000 to 
        65,000,000 informal caregivers helping to provide care to 
        adults with disabilities and illnesses. These caregivers help 
        with a range of tasks but more time is spent on tasks such as 
        shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, and laundry, and less 
        time is spent on activities of daily living such as feeding, 
        dressing, grooming, walking, bathing, and assistance toileting.
            (4) Over 60 percent of all informal caregivers work either 
        full- or part-time. Even with the growing number of direct care 
        workers available, there is a shortage in the number of people 
        available to help support individuals who need extra assistance 
        to remain in the community.
            (5) Only 12 percent of informal caregivers report having 
        used a respite service. Respite is a means of giving the 
        caregiver a break from their caregiving duties. Respite comes 
        in many forms and may include having the individual attend an 
        adult day program outside the home or having a friendly visitor 
        serve as a companion and provide light assistance while the 
        caregiver takes a break.
            (6) Respite volunteer programs exist in many communities. 
        There is a range of ways that these programs offer incentives 
        to the volunteers. Some programs use a time-banking or service-
        exchange approach as an incentive to engage volunteers, while 
        other programs access funds from private and public sources to 
        offer modest stipends to volunteers.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish a 
Caregiver Corps program to foster the creation of community-based Corps 
programs that provide for volunteer community service opportunities to 
address the shortage of assistance available for older adults and 
individuals with disabilities.
