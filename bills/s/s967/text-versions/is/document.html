                officer of the Armed Forces designated in accordance 
                with regulations prescribed for purposes of this 
                subsection from among commissioned officers of the

                proceed to trial of such charges by general or special 
                court-martial shall not operate to terminate or 
                otherwise alter the authority of commanding officers to 
                refer such charges for trial by summary court-martial 
                convened under section 824 of title 10, United States
