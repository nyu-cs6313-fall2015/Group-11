  <summary>1/14/2014--Introduced.
Food Stamp Fraud Prevention and Accountability Act - Amends the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 to disqualify from the supplemental nutrition assistance program (formerly known as the food stamp program) any person who has been found by a state or federal court or administrative agency hearing to have intentionally used an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card that was issued to a household of which the person is not a member.

Requires a state agency, if it elects not to require an EBT card to contain a photograph of one or more household members, to list on the EBT card the name of each household member who may use the card.

Requires a member of a household with such an EBT card to show photographic identification at the point of sale when using the card.</summary>
