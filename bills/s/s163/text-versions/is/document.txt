                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit any regulation regarding carbon dioxide or other greenhouse 
 gas emissions reduction in the United States until China, India, and 
                  Russia implement similar reductions.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF ADMINISTRATOR.

    In this Act, the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of 
the Environmental Protection Agency.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) in 1997, the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 98, 105th 
        Congress, agreed to July 25, 1997, which expressed the sense of 
        the Senate that the United States should not accept any 
        agreement that would mandate new commitments to limit or reduce 
        greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries unless the 
        agreement also mandated new specific scheduled commitments to 
        limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions by developing 
        countries within the same compliance period; and
            (2) the Administrator continues to move forward with the 
        regulation of carbon dioxide emissions, however, the People's 
        Republic of China, India, and the Russian Federation do not 
        impose similar regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.

SEC. 3. CARBON DIOXIDE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN 
              CHINA, INDIA, AND RUSSIA.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Administrator or 
the head of any other Federal agency or department shall not regulate 
or continue to implement or enforce any regulations, proposals, or 
actions establishing any carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions 
reductions until the Administrator, the Administrator of the Energy 
Information Agency, and the Secretary of Commerce certify in writing 
that--
            (1) the People's Republic of China, India, and the Russian 
        Federation have proposed, implemented, and enforced measures 
        requiring carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
        reductions; and
            (2) the reductions described in paragraph (1) are 
        substantially similar to the carbon dioxide and other 
        greenhouse gas emission reductions proposed by the 
        Administrator or the head of any other Federal agency or 
        department for the United States.

SEC. 4. REPEAL.

    Any regulation, proposal, or action in effect before, on, or after 
the date of enactment of this Act, but before the date on which the 
certification under section 3 is made, that requires any carbon dioxide 
or other greenhouse gas emissions reduction shall have no force or 
effect.
                                 <all>
