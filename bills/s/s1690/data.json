Provides for transitional services under such program to assist in the reintegration of offenders into the community. Reauthorizes the program through FY2018.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to identify and publish best practices relating to academic and vocational education for offenders in prisons, jails, and juvenile facilities.\n\n(Sec. 3) Requires the Inspector General of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to periodically conduct audits of not less than 5% of all recipients of specified offender reentry grants under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 and the Second Chance Act of 2007. Prohibits: (1) a grantee that is found to have an unresolved audit finding from receiving grant funds; and (2) the use of grant funds for lobbying DOJ representatives or representatives of a federal, state, local, or tribal government regarding the award of grant funding.\n\n(Sec. 4) Amends the Second Chance Act of 2007 to: (1) modify and extend through FY2018 grant programs for reentry of federal prisoners into the community, including the program for placing elderly offenders (not less than 60 years of age) in home detention; (2) repeal programs under such Act relating to responsible reintegration of offenders, the study of the effectiveness of depot naltrexone for heroin addiction, and the satellite tracking and reentry training program; and (3) establish a program for partnering faith-based or community-based nonprofit organizations with prisons to conduct recidivism reduction activities.\n\n(Sec. 5) Directs the Attorney General to establish an interagency task force on federal programs and activities for the reentry of offenders into the community. Requires the task force to: (1) identify and evaluate methods for improving such programs and activities, and (2) submit to Congress and annually update a report on barriers faced by offenders in reentering the community.\n\n(Sec. 6) Amends the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 to exclude from the scope of such Act grant programs administered by the Office of Violence Against Women or funded under certain provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 or the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 during the four-year period after enactment of this Act."
