    (a) Effective Enforcement of Interim Agreement.--
            (1) In general.--During the 240-day period beginning on the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the President may not, in 
        connection with the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, 
        exercise a waiver of, suspend, or otherwise reduce any 
        sanctions imposed in relation to Iran, whether imposed directly 
        by statute or through an Executive order, unless, not later 
        than 15 days before the waiver, suspension, or other reduction 
        takes effect, the President submits to the appropriate 
        congressional committees the certification described in 
        paragraph (2).
            (2) Certification described.--The certification described 
        in this paragraph is a certification with respect to the 
        waiver, suspension, or other reduction of sanctions under 
        paragraph (1) that--
                    (A) it is in the vital national security interests 
                of the United States to waive, suspend, or otherwise 
                reduce those sanctions; and
                    (B) Iran is in full compliance with the terms of 
                any interim agreement between the United States, the 
                United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, Germany, and 
                Iran relating to Iran's nuclear program.
            (3) Expiration of interim relief and reinstatement of 
        sanctions.--Any sanctions imposed in relation to Iran that have 
        been waived, suspended, or otherwise reduced in connection with 
        the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, regardless whether 
        the waiver, suspension, or other reduction of those sanctions 
        took effect before or after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, shall be immediately reinstated on the date that is 240 
        days after such date of enactment.
    (b) Effective Enforcement of Final Agreement and Limitations.--
            (1) In general.--On and after the date that is 240 days 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President may 
        not, in connection with the ongoing nuclear negotiations with 
        Iran, exercise a waiver of, suspend, or otherwise reduce any 
        sanctions imposed in relation to Iran, whether imposed directly 
        by statute or through an Executive order, unless, not later 
        than 15 days before the waiver, suspension, or other reduction 
        takes effect, the President submits to the appropriate 
        congressional committees the certification described in 
        paragraph (2).
            (2) Certification.--The certification described in this 
        paragraph is a certification that--
                    (A) the conditions for a temporary waiver, 
                suspension, or other reduction of sanctions pursuant to 
                subsection (a) continue to be met;
                    (B) Iran is in full compliance with the terms of 
                all agreements between the United States, the United 
                Kingdom, France, Russia, China, Germany, and Iran 
                relating to Iran's nuclear program;
                    (C) Iran is in full compliance with terms of United 
                Nations Security Council Resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 
                (2006), 1747 (2007), 1803 (2008), 1835 (2008), and 1929 
                (2010); and
                    (D) Iran has provided a full accounting of all of 
                its nuclear weaponization and related activities, has 
                committed, in writing, to suspend all such activities, 
                and is making substantial efforts to do so.
    (c) Reinstatement of Sanctions Upon Noncompliance.--If the 
President receives information from any person, including the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the Secretary of Defense, the 
Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, or the Director of 
National Intelligence, that Iran has failed to comply with the terms of 
any agreement between the United States, the United Kingdom, France, 
Russia, China, Germany, and Iran with respect to Iran's nuclear program 
or has refused to cooperate in any way with appropriate requests of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, the President shall--
            (1) not later than 10 days after receiving that 
        information, determine whether the information is credible and 
        accurate;
            (2) notify the appropriate congressional committees of that 
        determination; and
            (3) if the President determines that the information is 
        credible and accurate, not later than 5 days after making that 
        determination, reinstate all sanctions imposed in relation to 
        Iran that have been waived, suspended, or otherwise reduced in 
        connection with the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran, 
        without regard to whether the waiver, suspension, or other 
        reduction of those sanctions took effect before or after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act.
    (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' has the meaning given 
that term in section 14 of the Iran Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 
104-172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note).
