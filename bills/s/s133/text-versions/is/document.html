   or services under Federal health care programs and to ensure that 
    comparative effectiveness research accounts for advancements in 
  personalized medicine and differences in patient treatment response.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving Access to Targeted, 
Individualized, and Effective New Treatments and Services (PATIENTS) 
Act of 2013'' or the ``PATIENTS Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN USES OF DATA OBTAINED FROM COMPARATIVE 
              EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH; ACCOUNTING FOR PERSONALIZED 
              MEDICINE AND DIFFERENCES IN PATIENT TREATMENT RESPONSE.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services--
            (1) shall not use data obtained from the conduct of 
        comparative effectiveness research, including such research 
        that is conducted or supported using funds appropriated under 
        the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 
        111-5) or authorized or appropriated under the Patient 
        Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), to

        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7b(f))); and
            (2) shall ensure that comparative effectiveness research 
        conducted or supported by the Federal Government accounts for 
        factors contributing to differences in the treatment response 
        and treatment preferences of patients, including patient-
        reported outcomes, genomics and personalized medicine, the 
        unique needs of health disparity populations, and indirect 
        patient benefits.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as affecting the authority of the Commissioner of Food and 
Drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or the Public
