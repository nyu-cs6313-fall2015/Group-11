``Sec. 41705a. Accessibility of in-flight entertainment programming
    ``(a) In General.--In providing air transportation, an air carrier, 
including (subject to section 40105(b)) any foreign air carrier, shall 
ensure that--
            ``(1) on and after the date that is 180 days after the date 
        of the enactment of the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act, all 
        visually displayed entertainment programming available to 
        passengers on a flight is accessible to individuals with 
        disabilities, including by--
                    ``(A) providing, or making available, open 
                captioning for individuals with disabilities, including 
                individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, when such 
                programming is available to passengers through shared 
                video displays, such as a monitor located in a 
                passenger access aisle;
                    ``(B) providing, or making available, closed 
                captioning for individuals with disabilities, including 
                individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, when such 
                programming is available to passengers through 
                individual video displays; and
                    ``(C) providing, or making available, video 
                description for individuals with disabilities, 
                including individuals who are blind or visually 
                impaired, when such programming is available to 
                passengers through individual video displays or shared 
                video displays; and
            ``(2) not later than the effective date of the regulations 
        prescribed under subsection (c)(2), all individual video 
        displays that display entertainment programming or information 
        to passengers on a flight that are operated primarily by using 
        touchscreens or other contact-sensitive controls include a 
        mechanism that allows individuals with disabilities, including 
        individuals who are blind or visually impaired, to 
        independently operate the displays in accordance with the 
        standards prescribed under subsection (c).
    ``(b) Enforcement.--
            ``(1) In general.--The remedies and procedures set forth in 
        section 308(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
        (42 U.S.C. 12188(a)), including the injunctive relief described 
        in paragraph (2) of that section, shall be available to any 
        person aggrieved by the failure of an air carrier to comply 
        with subsection (a).
            ``(2) Enforcement by attorney general.--The provisions of 
        section 308(b) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
        (42 U.S.C. 12188(b)) shall apply with respect to the compliance 
        of air carriers with subsection (a) to the same extent that 
        those provisions apply with respect to the compliance of 
        covered entities with title III of that Act (42 U.S.C. 12181 et 
        seq.).
    ``(c) Establishment of Standards for Operation of Individual Video 
Displays.--
            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date

        prescribe standards in accordance with chapter 5 of title 5 
        (commonly known as the `Administrative Procedure Act') setting 
        forth the minimum technical criteria for individual video 
        displays described in subsection (a)(2) to ensure that such 
        video displays include a mechanism that allows individuals with 
        disabilities to operate the displays independently.
            ``(2) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the 
        Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board

        Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, in consultation with 
        the Secretary, shall periodically review and, as appropriate, 
        amend the standards prescribed under paragraph (1) in 
        accordance with chapter 5 of title 5. Not later than 180 days 
        after the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance 
        Board issues amended standards under this paragraph, the 
        Secretary shall make such revisions to the regulations
