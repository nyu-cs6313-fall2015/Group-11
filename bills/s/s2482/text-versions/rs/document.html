        filed not later than 30 days after the date on which the 
        regulations are promulgated or the action is published in the 
        Federal Register, as applicable.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Responses.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of law, the Secretary shall file a response to any 
        petition filed in accordance with paragraph (1), not later than

        petition, except that the appropriate court may extend the 
        period for filing such a response upon a showing by the 
        Secretary of good cause for that extension.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Copies of administrative record.--A response 
        of the Secretary under paragraph (2) shall include a copy of 
        the administrative record for the regulations that are the 
        subject of the petition.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Expedited hearings.--Upon a motion by the 
        person who files a petition under this subsection, the 
        appropriate court shall assign the matter for hearing at the 
        earliest possible date.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

subsection (e), the Secretary and the Secretary of the department in 
which the Coast Guard is operating shall prevent any person from 
violating this Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with the

        separate offense and the offense shall be deemed to have been

        offense and the offense shall be deemed to have been committed 
        not only in the district where the violation first occurred, 
        but also in any other district authorized by law. Any offense 
        not committed in any district is subject to the venue

                or business of any person.
            (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall
