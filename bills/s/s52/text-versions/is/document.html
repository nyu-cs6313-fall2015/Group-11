_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To improve the energy and water efficiency of Federal buildings.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Efficiency and Savings in 
Government Act''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to require the General Services Administration to audit 
        the energy performance of buildings owned by the General 
        Services Administration and identify--
                    (A) steps that can be taken to improve energy 
                efficiency and reduce costs; and
                    (B) cost-savings that can be achieved by 
                implementing energy efficiency measures;
            (2) to establish minimum efficiency standards for buildings 
        leased by the Federal government;
            (3) to increase energy efficiency and reduce pollution; and
            (4) to require regular reporting to Congress and the public 
        on the energy use of Federal buildings and the cost-savings and 
        pollution reduction associated with efficiency measures.

SEC. 3. ENERGY AUDITS OF PUBLIC BUILDINGS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, each energy manager (as defined in section 543(f)(1) of 
the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8253(f)(1))) of 
a building owned by the General Services Administration shall carry out 
an audit of that building that--
            (1) identifies any modifications necessary to improve 
        energy efficiency that, within 10 years of implementation, will 
        result in energy cost savings equal to the total investment 
        made; and
            (2) quantifies the estimated cost-savings associated with 
        any energy efficiency improvements identified by the energy 
        manager.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Administrator of General Services shall report to the 
Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
Representatives on--
            (1) all efficiency improvements identified in the audits 
        carried out under subsection (a);
            (2) the total estimated cost-savings associated with the 
        efficiency improvements described in paragraph (1); and
            (3) the status of implementation of the efficiency 
        improvements described in paragraph (1).
