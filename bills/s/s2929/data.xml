  <summary>11/17/2014--Introduced.
Providing Opportunities to Work for Energy Reliability Act or the POWER Act - Amends the Federal Power Act to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to review any decision by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NAERC) to approve a new balancing authority that would alter cost allocations under an existing system support resources agreement.

Precludes such new balancing authority from taking effect until approved by FERC.

Requires FERC to publish a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed NAERC decision, including its likely financial impact upon ratepayers, before issuing a decision to approve, disapprove, or modify the NAERC decision.</summary>
