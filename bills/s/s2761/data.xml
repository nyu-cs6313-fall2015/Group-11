  <summary>7/31/2014--Introduced.
Local Empowerment Act - Revises requirements for the apportionment of state planning funds to metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs).

Requires a state's apportionment to be distributed in accordance with a formula that prioritizes the needs of high performing MPOs.

Revises certain allocations of surface transportation program funds to states for: (1) any areas with a population of fewer (under current law, non-urban areas with more) than 5,000, and (2) urbanized areas with a population of more than 200,000 that have a high performing MPO.

Extends for FY2015-FY2018 a state's obligational authority to distribute a specified amount of surface transportation program funds for federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs in urbanized areas with a population over 200,000, including those areas that have a high performing MPO.

Makes permanent a special rule authorizing a state to obligate up to 15% of its apportionment of surface transportation program funds for each fiscal on roads functionally classified as minor collectors in areas of less than 5,000 population.

Defines "consolidated metropolitan planning organization" to mean a sole MPO that serves a metropolitan statistical area.

Prescribes requirements for the designation of new and consolidation of multiple MPOs within a metropolitan statistical area.

Allows a MPO for an urbanized area with a population of more than 200,000 to request that the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) designate it as a high performing MPO. Specifies criteria the Secretary shall consider in making such designation.

Makes similar changes to requirements for the transportation alternatives program.</summary>
