    (b) Construction.--
            (1) Required measures.--The Chief of Engineers shall 
        construct measures to improve the Brandon Road Lock and Dam to

            (1) implementing existing Asian carp monitoring and control 
        strategies at the Brandon Road location, as applicable;
            (2) using the Brandon Road location to the greatest extent
