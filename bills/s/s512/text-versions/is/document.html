SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Academically gifted and talented students make up an 
        estimated 6 to 10 percent of the prekindergarten through grade 
        12 student population, totaling between 3,000,000 and 6,000,000 
        students.
            (2) There is a growing excellence gap at the highest levels 
        of achievement between the performance of subgroups of 
        students, particularly between the performance of students who 
        are African-American or Hispanic and the performance of White 
        students, and between low-income students compared to their 
        more advantaged peers, on statewide assessments and on the 
        National Assessment of Educational Progress.
            (3) Advanced students in the United States lag behind the 
        performance of similar students in other countries, which puts 
        the Nation at a competitive disadvantage.
            (4) Gifted and talented students, and high-ability students 
        who have not been formally identified for gifted education 
        services, require modifications to the general education 
        curriculum to fully meet their potential.
            (5) Effective assessment and instruction of gifted and 
        talented students requires educators to have specialized 
        knowledge and skills.
            (6) Ninety percent of teachers nationwide want more 
        professional development focused on the skills necessary for 
        teaching advanced students.
            (7) Interventions and strategies that have been 
        demonstrated to be successful with gifted and talented students 
        can be modified to improve the achievement of all students.
            (8) The availability of gifted education programs and 
        services to students who require such services is unequal and 
        often relies solely on local resources and leadership, leaving 
        many high-ability students from rural areas or who are English 
        language learners or Hispanic, African-American, or Native 
        American, among others, without access to appropriate services.
            (9) There are an estimated 360,000 students in the United 
        States who are both gifted and have a disability. These ``twice 
        exceptional'' children present special challenges because their 
        disability often masks their academic potential or their 
        academic strengths may mask their disability, resulting in a 
        lack of services and supports for this student population.
            (10) The development and dissemination of research and 
        national data on gifted and talented students is necessary to--
                    (A) guide evidence-based classroom practices vital 
                to meeting the unique needs of this population of 
                students; and
                    (B) contribute to the decisionmaking of educators, 
                families, and policymakers.
