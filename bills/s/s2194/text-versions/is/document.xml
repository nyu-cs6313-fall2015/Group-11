			 investment in higher education, in order to strengthen the economy of the
			 United States by improving opportunities for low-income students to
			 complete higher education and join the middle class.</text></section><section id="id5412B954DAD143829388317CF7FEBA26"><enum>3.</enum><header>Findings</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Congress finds the following:</text><paragraph id="id1e0be4ecde9d425ba98fd87d0b4ca563"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Federal Pell Grants provided under  section 401 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20
			 U.S.C. 1070a) (referred to in this Act as <quote>Federal Pell Grants</quote>) have historically been the fundamental Federal investment in helping low-income students pay for
			 college and enter the middle class. In  the 1979–1980 academic year, the
			 maximum Federal  Pell Grant paid for 77 percent of the average cost of
			 attendance at an in-State, 4-year institution of higher education.
			 However, in the 2012–2013 academic year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant
			 covered only about 30 percent of that average cost of attendance.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id2E611EC5236E42EA97A22601B668410E"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The program providing Federal Pell Grants already acts as a quasi-entitlement, in which both
			 mandatory funding and discretionary funding
			 combine to maintain a maximum Federal Pell Grant amount.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id8d495f8effee49ae8532a48beacd1049"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Congressional Budget Office reports on any overall financial surplus or shortfall in the
			 funding provided for the Federal Pell Grant program. However, in recent
			 years, in order to meet the maximum Federal Pell Grant level with the
			 provided level of funding, Congress has made cuts to the program through
			 imposing additional eligibility requirements for Federal Pell Grants and
			 limiting the availability of year-round Federal Pell Grants, causing
			 significant uncertainty and reducing access to higher education for
			 millions of hardworking college students.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id0f1f96a796be4daeb246a08fd7582f72"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Removing the Federal Pell Grant program from the uncertainty of the congressional discretionary
			 appropriations process will improve student access to, and the
			 affordability of, higher education.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="id0b85581cc8fa44f5b82b2911ab019c54"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The <quote>traditional student</quote> who attends college for 4 years immediately after high school is now a minority of college

			 Law 112–10, 125 Stat. 169) eliminated the provision of the Federal Pell
			 Grant program of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a et
			 seq.) that allowed 2 Federal Pell Grant awards per year, creating
			 significant hardship for many students trying to take courses over the
			 summer
			 or outside the traditional school calendar. Allowing students to continue
			 to receive Federal Pell Grants in successive semesters, without a gap,
			 would reduce the time needed to complete their degrees.</text></paragraph></section><section id="id138cb8a177a246269ed74b1c0c6e97f3"><enum>4.</enum><header>Converting the traditional Federal Pell Grant program to a mandatory spending program</header><subsection id="id1da0504649bf48b2a405ae8abcc2deb6"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Legislative provisions</header><text>Section 401(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/20/1070a">20 U.S.C. 1070a(b)</external-xref>) is amended—</text><paragraph id="id55F61D51215F49C4AF56E575385849D1"><enum>(1)</enum><text>in paragraph (2)—</text><subparagraph id="id831D63EEAD2E4566802595A72C1475C8"><enum>(A)</enum><text>in subparagraph (A)—</text><clause id="id9105A52F22CA493DAFBCF6D316E9561D"><enum>(i)</enum><text>by striking clauses (i) and (ii) and inserting the following:</text><quoted-block display-inline="no-display-inline" id="idC81EFFE6D2834E4B911D1AB912C28B40" style="OLC"><clause id="id8d695de9eab841909db32924ed873d81"><enum>(i)</enum><subclause commented="no" display-inline="yes-display-inline" id="id7D108E42C799461E9D0680597834DCD8"><enum>(I)</enum><text>for award year 2014–2015, $5,730; or</text></subclause><subclause id="id59e71d84b5874ed1b3c3d5f7816156d4" indent="up1"><enum>(II)</enum><text>for award year 2015–2016 and each subsequent award year, the amount of the maximum Federal Pell
