 To provide for fiscal gap and generational accounting analysis in the 
   legislative process, the President's budget, and annual long-term

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Intergenerational Financial 
Obligations Reform Act'' or the ``INFORM Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Fiscal gap.--The term ``fiscal gap'' means an economic 
        analysis that--
                    (A) calculates the difference between the present 
                value of all projected future Federal spending, 
                including interest and principal payments on the 
                initial outstanding debt, and the present value of all 
                projected future Federal revenues, over an infinite 
                time horizon;
                    (B) calculates the permanent Federal revenue 
                increases and spending reductions and identifies the 
                combination of fiscal policy options starting in the 
                budget year, and 5, 10, 15, and 25 years after the 
                budget year, needed to eliminate the infinite horizon 
                fiscal gap calculated as of the budget year; and
                    (C) calculates the increases in the levels of 
                annual rates of economic growth factors, including 
                technological change, labor productivity, and capital 
                deepening, starting in the budget year, and 5, 10, 15, 
                and 25 years after the budget year, needed to eliminate 
                the infinite horizon fiscal gap calculated as of the 
                budget year.
            (2) Generation.--The term ``generation'' means a 1-year age 
        cohort.
            (3) Generational accounting.--The term ``generational 
        accounting'' means an economic analysis that calculates--
                    (A) the projected present value lifetime net 
                Federal tax burden facing each living adult generation 
                over 18 years of age; and
                    (B) the present value lifetime net Federal tax 
                burdens facing each current generation of children 18 
                years of age and under, as well as each future 
                generation, assuming--
                            (i) the sum of all present value lifetime 
                        net Federal tax burdens facing each current 
                        generation of children 18 years of age and 
                        under, as well as each future generation, 
                        covers the present value of future 
                        discretionary spending, including interest and 
                        principal payments on the initial outstanding 
                        debt, less the sum of all present value 
                        lifetime net Federal tax burdens facing living 
                        adult generations over 18 years of age; and
                            (ii) the lifetime net Federal tax burden of 
                        generations 18 years of age and under, as well 
                        as future generations, increases with year of 
                        birth at the projected growth rate of labor 
                        productivity.
            (4) Net federal tax burden.--The term ``net Federal tax 
        burden'' means the difference between Federal taxes paid and 
        transfer payments received.
