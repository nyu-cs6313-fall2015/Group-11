Code (article 60(c) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), is 
amended by adding at the end the following new sentence: ``In taking 
such an action (other than an action to approve a sentence), the 
convening authority or other person taking such action shall prepare a 
written justification of such action, which written justification shall 
be made a part of the record of the court-martial.''.
    (b) Prohibition on Dismissal of Finding or Change to Finding of 
Guilty of Lesser Included Offense.--Such section (such article) is

            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(4) If a convening authority or other person acts on the findings 
of a court-martial, the convening authority or other person may not--
            ``(A) dismiss any charge or specification by setting aside 
        a finding of guilty thereto; or
            ``(B) change a finding of guilty to a charge or 
        specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a 
        lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or 
        specification.''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply with 
respect to findings and sentences of courts-martial reported to 
convening authorities under section 860 of title 10, United States Code

or after that date.
