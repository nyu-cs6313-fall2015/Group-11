                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the opposition of Congress to Federal efforts to establish a 
        carbon tax on fuels for electricity and transportation.

Whereas affordable and abundant electricity from coal and natural gas is a 
        strategic resource that is essential to modern life, America's economic 
        competitiveness, and, ultimately, independence from foreign and volatile 
        sources of energy;
Whereas the application of a carbon tax to gasoline and other transportation 
        fuels will have a dramatic, immediate impact on transportation costs, 
        with the greatest impact being felt by low-income Americans and their 
        families;
Whereas a carbon tax is designed to result in substantial, immediate increases 
        in the price of electricity, making electricity less affordable for 
        millions of Americans;
Whereas a carbon tax applicable to coal and natural gas electricity generation 
        would be punitive and harmful to the American people by artificially 
        raising electricity costs;
Whereas, with continuing high national joblessness and an unemployment rate 
        exceeding 7.8 percent every month since February 2009, a carbon tax will 
        drive the unemployment rate even higher;
Whereas a carbon tax is likely to have an uneven effect, hitting different 
        regions of the country and segments of the economy much more severely 
        than others;
Whereas a carbon tax is regressive and will impose the greatest burden on low-
        income individuals and families who already spend the largest share of 
        their income on energy and are least able to afford a carbon tax;
Whereas economic modeling of Australia's recently implemented carbon tax shows 
        that it increases energy costs, and reduces growth in GDP, productivity, 
        and household incomes;
Whereas a carbon tax in the United States will have no impact on China, India, 
        and other major sources of carbon emissions throughout the world, except 
        to increase their competitiveness with the United States; and
Whereas a carbon tax will put United States exporters at a competitive 
        disadvantage by increasing domestic manufacturing production costs: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress opposes Federal efforts to establish a carbon tax on 
fuels for electricity and transportation.
                                 <all>
