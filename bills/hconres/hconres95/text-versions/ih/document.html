                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress regarding support for voluntary, 
    incentive-based, private land conservation implemented through 
     cooperation with local soil and water conservation districts.

Whereas over 70 percent of the contiguous United States is privately owned;
Whereas the future of the environment is determined by the decisions made by the 
        men and women who own and manage that land, including urban landscapes;
Whereas world population is projected to reach 9,000,000,000 people by 2050;
Whereas increased production will be needed from agricultural land to feed the 
        increasing population;
Whereas meeting these needs will make caring for the environment more difficult; 
        and
Whereas landowners work to ensure they sustain a healthy environment to support 
        abundant wildlife: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That--
            (1) Congress supports the conservation of the Nation's 
        natural resources and working lands; and
            (2) it is the sense of Congress that voluntary, incentive-
        based, private land conservation, provided in partnership with 
        local conservation districts, is necessary to sustain natural 
        resources, meet the needs of a growing population, and ensure 
        safe, abundant, and adequate resources for current and future 
        generations.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
