        H.Con.Res.58
                                      Agreed to October 16, 2013        

                     One Hundred Thirteenth Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE FIRST SESSION

          Begun and held at the City of Washington on Thursday,
           the third day of January, two thousand and thirteen


                          Concurrent Resolution

Whereas the Department of Defense determined that some contractor 
  clergy, like other Department of Defense contractors, were unable to 
  perform their contractual duties during the current lapse in 
  appropriations;

Whereas this determination may have impacted the ability of members of 
  the Armed Forces and their families to worship and participate in 
  religious activities;

Whereas military chaplains on active duty, like all military personnel 
  on active duty, continue to perform their duties during the current 
  lapse in appropriations;

Whereas the Department continues to analyze its authorities under the 
  Pay Our Military Act (Public Law 113-39) with respect to contractors; 
  and

Whereas the Pay Our Military Act appropriates such sums as are 
  necessary to pay contractors of the Department whom the Secretary of 
  Defense determines are providing support to members of the Armed 
  Forces: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
        (1) finds that the provision and availability of religious 
    services and clergy is important to the morale and wellbeing of 
    many members of the Armed Forces and their families; and
        (2) hopes the Secretary of Defense is able to determine that 
    contractor clergy provide necessary support to military personnel, 
    and would therefore be covered under the appropriations made 
    available under the Pay Our Military Act (Public Law 113-39).
Attest:

                                 Clerk of the House of Representatives.

Attest:

                                               Secretary of the Senate.
