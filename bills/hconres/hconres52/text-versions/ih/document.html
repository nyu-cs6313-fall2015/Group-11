                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           September 12, 2013

     Mr. Ribble (for himself and Mr. Walz) submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Ways and 
                                 Means

_______________________________________________________________________

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of Congress that the Federal excise tax on heavy-
                  duty trucks should not be increased.

Whereas there is a 12-percent Federal excise tax on new tractor trailer trucks 
        and certain other heavy-duty trucks;
Whereas the 12-percent Federal excise tax is the highest percentage rate of any 
        Federal ad valorem excise tax;
Whereas the Federal excise tax was first levied by Congress in 1917 to help 
        finance America's involvement in World War I;
Whereas, in 2012, the average manufacturer suggested retail price for heavy-duty 
        trucks was over $158,000;
Whereas the 12 percent Federal excise tax adds, on average, an additional 
        $18,960 to the cost of a heavy-duty truck;
Whereas the average in-use, heavy-duty truck is 9.5 years old, close to the 
        historical all-time high;
Whereas the Federal excise tax, by significantly increasing the cost of new 
        heavy-duty trucks, keeps older, less environmentally clean and less fuel 
        economical heavy-duty trucks in service longer;
Whereas the Environmental Protection Agency's model year 2002-2010 tailpipe 
        emissions rules account for $20,000 of the average price of today's new 
        heavy-duty trucks;
Whereas, according to the 2010 National Academy of Sciences report entitled 
        ``Technologies and Approaches to Reducing the Fuel Consumption of Medium 
        and Heavy-Duty Vehicles'', model year 2014-2018 EPA-Department of 
        Transportation fuel economy rules will add an average of $10,000 to 
        $15,000 to the price of new heavy-duty trucks;
Whereas the $30,000 average per truck cost of these regulatory mandates results 
        in an additional $3,600 Federal excise tax, on average;
Whereas the goal of deploying cleaner, more fuel efficient heavy-duty trucks, 
        coupled with the $30,000 average per truck regulatory cost would be 
        slowed even more if the Federal excise tax were increased;
Whereas the goal of deploying safer heavy-duty trucks with the latest safety 
        technologies, such as lane departure warning systems, electronic 
        stability control, and automatic braking for reduced stopping distance 
        would be slowed if the Federal excise tax were increased;
Whereas 100 percent of all heavy-duty trucks sold in the United States are 
        manufactured in North America; and
Whereas 3,650,000 Americans are employed in the selling, servicing, 
        manufacturing, and operating of heavy-duty trucks: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That--
            (1) the Federal excise tax on new tractor trailer trucks 
        and certain other heavy-duty trucks inhibits the sale of the 
        cleanest, safest, and most fuel efficient heavy-duty trucks and 
        trailers;
            (2) the Federal excise tax on new tractor trailer trucks 
        and certain other heavy-duty trucks adds uncertainty and 
        volatility to the Highway Trust Fund due to the cyclical nature 
        of heavy-duty truck and trailer sales; and
            (3) the Federal excise tax on new truck tractors, heavy-
        duty trucks, and certain truck trailers should not be 
        increased, and in considering future transportation policy, 
        Congress should carefully review the detrimental impacts of the 
        Federal excise tax.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
