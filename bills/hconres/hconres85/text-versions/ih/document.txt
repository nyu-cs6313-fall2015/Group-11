                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress that a commemorative postage stamp 
           should be issued in honor of the Buffalo Soldiers.

Whereas, on July 28, 1866, Congress established six all-Black regiments, later 
        consolidated to four, to help rebuild the country after the Civil War 
        and to patrol the remote western frontier during the Indian wars;
Whereas Colonel Charles Young was a Buffalo Soldier and the highest ranking 
        African-American commanding officer in the United States Army from 1894 
        until his death in 1922;
Whereas more than 200,000 African-Americans served in World War I and more than 
        1 million served in World War II;
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers received their name because of the buffalo's fierce 
        bravery and fighting spirit;
Whereas African-American troops accepted the name, Buffalo Soldiers, with pride 
        and honor;
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers fought alongside White regiments in many conflicts 
        and were instrumental in the exploration and settlement of western 
        lands;
Whereas, over the 82 years of the Buffalo Soldiers' existence, 23 men received 
        the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest recognition awarded by the 
        United States Government for military service;
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers ceased to exist in 1948 when President Harry Truman 
        signed Executive Order 9981 mandating equal treatment and opportunity 
        for African-American servicemen;
Whereas the Buffalo Soldiers are a significant part of American military 
        history;
Whereas a stamp was issued in honor of the Buffalo Soldiers on April 22, 1994, 
        and this stamp was placed on ``off sale'' in December 1995; and
Whereas reissuing a postage stamp to honor the Buffalo Soldiers is fitting and 
        proper: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued in honor 
        of the Buffalo Soldiers; and
            (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend 
        to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.
                                 <all>
