                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the goals and ideals of No Name-Calling Week in bringing 
 attention to name-calling of all kinds and providing schools with the 
  tools and inspiration to launch an on-going dialogue about ways to 
       eliminate name-calling and bullying in their communities.

Whereas No Name-Calling Week is an annual week of educational activities aimed 
        at ending name-calling of all kinds and providing schools with the tools 
        and inspiration to launch an on-going dialogue about ways to eliminate 
        name-calling and bullying in their communities;
Whereas 60 organizations, including the National School Boards Association, 
        National Association of Elementary School Principals, National 
        Association of Secondary School Principals, National Education 
        Association, National Association of School Psychologists, Gay, Lesbian 
        and Straight Education Network, and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, 
        have come together as No Name-Calling Week partner organizations;
Whereas thousands of students have participated in No Name-Calling Week since 
        its inception in 2004;
Whereas the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network has conducted and 
        released national studies analyzing the pervasive harassment and 
        victimization faced by elementary students and lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
        and transgender (LGBT) secondary students;
Whereas 26 percent of elementary students reported hearing others say hurtful 
        things based on another student's race or ethnic background;
Whereas 30 percent of elementary students reported being bullied or called names 
        at some point while in school;
Whereas over 70 percent of LGBT middle and high school students frequently hear 
        homophobic remarks and over 80 percent of LGBT middle and high school 
        students were verbally harassed in the past year because of their sexual 
        orientation; and
Whereas 55 percent of LGBT middle and high school students experienced 
        harassment via electronic means in the past year: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of No Name-Calling Week; 
        and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        No Name-Calling Week with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and 
        activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
