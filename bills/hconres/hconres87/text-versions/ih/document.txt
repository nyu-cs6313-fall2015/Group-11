                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the occasion of the 200th Anniversary of the Star Spangled 
     Banner and its importance to the people of the United States.

Whereas the year 2014 marks the bicentennial of the Star Spangled Banner;
Whereas after a sustained 25-hour bombardment by the British Royal Navy on Fort 
        McHenry between September 13 and 14, 1814, a large 15-star, 15-stripe 
        American flag was raised over the fort;
Whereas the Battle of Baltimore was a turning point in the War of 1812;
Whereas an American lawyer, Francis Scott Key, witnessed the siege from a 
        British ship while negotiating the release of a captured American 
        doctor;
Whereas Mr. Key wrote a four-stanza poem recounting the heroic defense of Fort 
        McHenry and the city of Baltimore from invasion, representing a turning 
        point in the War of 1812;
Whereas the first stanza of the poem written by Mr. Key was adopted as the 
        national anthem of the United States on March 3, 1931; and
Whereas the Star Spangled Banner recounts this important moment in the Nation's 
        history and symbolizes the resilience and perseverance of the American 
        people and our willingness to defend our freedom: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress recognizes the significance of our national anthem and 
its importance to the people of the United States on the occasion of 
its 200th anniversary.
