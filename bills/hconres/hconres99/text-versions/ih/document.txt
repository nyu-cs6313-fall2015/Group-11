                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing support for designation of a ``National Lao-Hmong 
                           Recognition Day''.

Whereas the Lao-Hmong, which means ``free people'', are Laotian members of the 
        Hmong tribe and are noted for their warrior tradition, loyalty, and 
        bravery;
Whereas beginning in 1960, the United States recruited thousands of the Lao-
        Hmong to fight against the Communist Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese 
        Army regulars in Laos;
Whereas the United States relied heavily on the Lao-Hmong Special Guerrilla 
        Units to engage in direct combat with North Vietnamese troops from 1960 
        to 1975;
Whereas the Lao-Hmong conducted tactical guerrilla actions, flew thousands of 
        deadly combat missions in support of the Armed Forces and the Central 
        Intelligence Agency, and fought in conventional and guerrilla combat 
        clashes with extreme casualties;
Whereas the Lao-Hmong, although outnumbered, fought against enemy forces to 
        disrupt the flow of troops and war supplies along the Ho Chi Minh Trail;
Whereas the Lao-Hmong protected United States personnel, guarded United States 
        Air Force radar installations, gathered critical intelligence about 
        enemy operations, and undertook rescue missions to save the lives of 
        downed United States pilots;
Whereas more than 35,000 of the Lao-Hmong lost their lives, and many more were 
        seriously injured and disabled;
Whereas thousands of Lao-Hmong suffered grievous injuries and permanent 
        disabilities, and thousands more were captured and sent to concentration 
        camps;
Whereas after the conclusion of the war, many Lao-Hmong soldiers were the 
        victims of acts of retribution and atrocities by the Pathet Lao, causing 
        many of the Lao-Hmong to flee to neighboring Thailand and become 
        refugees; and
Whereas beginning with the City Council of Golden, Colorado, in 1995, various 
        State and local governments have issued proclamations declaring July 22 
        as ``Lao-Hmong Recognition Day'', and the establishment of a ``National 
        Lao-Hmong Recognition Day'' would recognize the bravery, sacrifice, and 
        loyalty to the United States exhibited by the Lao-Hmong in Southeast 
        Asia: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) expresses support for the designation of ``National 
        Lao-Hmong Recognition Day''; and
            (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation 
        calling upon the people of the United States to observe 
        ``National Lao-Hmong Recognition Day'' with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities.
                                 <all>
