                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress that a commemorative postage stamp 
should be issued by the United States Postal Service honoring the 1915 
  Panama-California Exposition, and that the Citizens' Stamp Advisory 
Committee should recommend to the Postmaster General that such a stamp 
                               be issued.

Whereas San Diego played host to the Panama-California Exposition from January 
        1, 1915, until January 1, 1917;
Whereas the Panama-California Exposition recognized the historic completion of 
        the Panama Canal, which revolutionized transcontinental trade;
Whereas, on May 22, 1911, the House of Representatives passed a congressional 
        resolution endorsing San Diego's Panama-California Exposition and called 
        on President William Howard Taft to invite our Central and South 
        American partner nations as exposition participants;
Whereas seven States--California, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Washington, Montana, 
        and Kansas--participated in that exposition and highlighted the 
        unrealized potential of the American West;
Whereas San Diego has realized that potential over the past 100 years, growing 
        to become the second largest city in California, the eighth largest city 
        in our Nation, and a world leader in biomedical and technology research 
        that was unimaginable a hundred years ago;
Whereas architects John and Frederick Olmsted of Massachusetts, Frank P. Allen, 
        Jr., of Washington State, and Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue of New York 
        collaborated to transform a little-used public park into a forward-
        looking urban landmark to host the exposition;
Whereas that park, known as Balboa Park, has since continued to host 
        internationally recognized artistic performances, educational exhibits, 
        and, during both World Wars, served as an active military installation;
Whereas the National Park Service recognized this rich history when it 
        designated Balboa Park as a National Historic Landmark in 1977; and
Whereas Balboa Park will celebrate its centennial beginning in 2015 with a year 
        of festivities that showcase San Diego's intellectual capital, 
        imaginative spirit, and exceptional quality of life: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued by the 
        United States Postal Service honoring the 1915 Panama-
        California Exposition; and
            (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend 
        to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
