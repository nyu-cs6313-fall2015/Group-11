Whereas the National Railroad Memorial is an idea originally conceived by 
        William Taylor, Jr., of Niles, Michigan, to honor the men and women of 
        the railroad industry;
Whereas the National Railroad Memorial is a centerpiece of Diamond District 
        Park, located at the historic crossroads of three major railroads and 
        one of the largest surviving train stations in the United States;
Whereas the National Railroad Memorial is intended to encompass the statuary, 
        structures, and historic railroad equipment located in historic Durand,
