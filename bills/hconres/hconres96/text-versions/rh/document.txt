                 TITLE IV--ESTIMATES OF DIRECT SPENDING

SEC. 401. DIRECT SPENDING.

    (a) Means-tested Direct Spending.--
            (1) For means-tested direct spending, the average rate of 
        growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year period 
        preceding fiscal year 2015 is 6.8 percent.
            (2) For means-tested direct spending, the estimated average 
        rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year 
        period beginning with fiscal year 2015 is 5.4 percent under 
        current law.
            (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent 
        resolution for means-tested direct spending:
                    (A) In 1996, a Republican Congress and a Democratic 
                president reformed welfare by limiting the duration of 
                benefits, giving States more control over the program, 
                and helping recipients find work. In the five years 
                following passage, child-poverty rates fell, welfare 
                caseloads fell, and workers' wages increased. This 
                budget applies the lessons of welfare reform to both 
                the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and 
                Medicaid.
                    (B) For Medicaid, this budget assumes the 
                conversion of the Federal share of Medicaid spending 
                into a flexible State allotment tailored to meet each 
                State's needs, indexed for inflation and population 
                growth. Such a reform would end the misguided one-size-
                fits-all approach that has tied the hands of State 
                governments. Instead, each State would have the freedom 
                and flexibility to tailor a Medicaid program that fits 
                the needs of its unique population. Moreover, this 
                budget assumes the repeal of the Medicaid expansions in 
                the President's health care law, relieving State 
                governments of its crippling one-size-fits-all 
                enrollment mandates.
                    (C) For the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
                Program, this budget assumes the conversion of the 
                program into a flexible State allotment tailored to 
                meet each State's needs. The allotment would increase 
                based on the Department of Agriculture Thrifty Food 
                Plan index and beneficiary growth. Such a reform would 
                provide incentives for States to ensure dollars will go 
                towards those who need them most. Additionally, it 
                requires that more stringent work requirements and time 
                limits apply under the program.
    (b) Nonmeans-tested Direct Spending.--
            (1) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the average rate 
        of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year 
        period preceding fiscal year 2015 is 5.7 percent.
            (2) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the estimated 
        average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 
        10-year period beginning with fiscal year 2015 is 5.4 percent 
        under current law.
            (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent 
        resolution for nonmeans-tested direct spending:
                    (A) For Medicare, this budget advances policies to 
                put seniors, not the Federal Government, in control of 
                their health care decisions. Those in or near 
                retirement will see no changes, while future retirees 
                would be given a choice of private plans competing 
                alongside the traditional fee-for-service Medicare 
                program. Medicare would provide a premium-support 
                payment either to pay for or offset the premium of the 
                plan chosen by the senior, depending on the plan's 
                cost. The Medicare premium-support payment would be 
                adjusted so that the sick would receive higher payments 
                if their conditions worsened; lower-income seniors 
                would receive additional assistance to help cover out-
                of-pocket costs; and wealthier seniors would assume 
                responsibility for a greater share of their premiums. 
                Putting seniors in charge of how their health care 
                dollars are spent will force providers to compete 
                against each other on price and quality. This market 
                competition will act as a real check on widespread 
                waste and skyrocketing health care costs.
                    (B) In keeping with a recommendation from the 
                National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and 
                Reform, this budget calls for Federal employees--
                including Members of Congress and congressional staff--
                to make greater contributions toward their own 
                retirement.

                    (A) Medical Services;
                    (B) Medical Support and Compliance; and
                    (C) Medical Facilities accounts of the Veterans

    (a) Adjustments of Discretionary and Direct Spending Levels.--If a 
committee (other than the Committee on Appropriations) reports a bill 
or joint resolution, or amendment thereto or conference report thereon, 
providing for a decrease in direct spending (budget authority and 
outlays flowing therefrom) for any fiscal year and also provides for an 
authorization of appropriations for the same purpose, upon the 
enactment of such measure, the chair of the Committee on the Budget may 
decrease the allocation to such committee and increase the allocation 
of discretionary spending (budget authority and outlays flowing 
therefrom) to the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2015 by 
an amount equal to the new budget authority (and outlays flowing 
therefrom) provided for in a bill or joint resolution making 
appropriations for the same purpose.
    (b) Adjustments to Fund Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War 
on Terrorism.--In order to take into account any new information 
included in the budget submission by the President for fiscal year 
2015, the chair of the Committee on the Budget may adjust the

report of this concurrent resolution to conform with section 251(c) of

revisions in the allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate levels 
of this concurrent resolution shall not be subject to the points of 
order set forth in clause 10 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of 
Representatives or section 504.

SEC. 507. CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATES.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Costs of Federal housing loans and loan guarantees are 
        treated unequally in the budget. The Congressional Budget 
        Office uses fair-value accounting to measure the costs of 
        Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but determines the cost of other 
        Federal loan and loan-guarantee programs on the basis of the 
        Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (``FCRA'').
            (2) The fair-value accounting method uses discount rates 
        which incorporate the risk inherent to the type of liability 
        being estimated in addition to Treasury discount rates of the 
        proper maturity length. In contrast, FCRA accounting solely 
        uses the discount rates of the Treasury, failing to incorporate 
        all of the risks attendant to these credit activities.
            (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if fair-
        value were used to estimate the cost of all new credit activity 
        in 2014, the deficit would be approximately $50 billion higher 
        than under the current methodology.
    (b) Fair Value Estimates.--Upon the request of the chair or ranking 
member of the Committee on the Budget, any estimate prepared by the 
Director of the Congressional Budget Office for a measure under the 
terms of title V of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, ``credit 
reform'', as a supplement to such estimate shall, to the extent 
practicable, also provide an estimate of the current actual or 
estimated market values representing the ``fair value'' of assets and 
liabilities affected by such measure.
    (c) Fair Value Estimates for Housing Programs.--Whenever the 
Director of the Congressional Budget Office prepares an estimate 
pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 of the 
costs which would be incurred in carrying out any bill or joint 
resolution and if the Director determines that such bill or joint 
resolution has a cost related to a housing or residential mortgage 
program under the FCRA, then the Director shall also provide an 
estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing 
the ``fair value'' of assets and liabilities affected by the provisions 
of such bill or joint resolution that result in such cost.
    (d) Enforcement.--If the Director of the Congressional Budget 
Office provides an estimate pursuant to subsection (b) or (c), the 
chair of the Committee on the Budget may use such estimate to determine 
compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other 
budgetary enforcement controls.

SEC. 508. TRANSFERS FROM THE GENERAL FUND OF THE TREASURY TO THE 
              HIGHWAY TRUST FUND THAT INCREASE PUBLIC INDEBTEDNESS.

    For purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, or the rules or 
orders of the House of Representatives, a bill or joint resolution, or 
an amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that transfers funds 
from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund shall 
be counted as new budget authority and outlays equal to the amount of 
the transfer in the fiscal year the transfer occurs.

SEC. 509. SEPARATE ALLOCATION FOR OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS/
              GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM.

    (a) Allocation.--In the House, there shall be a separate allocation 
to the Committee on Appropriations for overseas contingency operations/
global war on terrorism. For purposes of enforcing such separate 
allocation under section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 
1974, the ``first fiscal year'' and the ``total of fiscal years'' shall 
be deemed to refer to fiscal year 2015. Such separate allocation shall 
be the exclusive allocation for overseas contingency operations/global 
war on terrorism under section 302(a) of such Act. Section 302(c) of 
such Act shall not apply to such separate allocation. The Committee on 
Appropriations may provide suballocations of such separate allocation 
under section 302(b) of such Act. Spending that counts toward the 
allocation established by this section shall be designated pursuant to 
section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit 
Control Act of 1985.
    (b) Adjustment.--In the House, for purposes of subsection (a) for 
fiscal year 2015, no adjustment shall be made under section 314(a) of 
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 if any adjustment would be made 
under section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985.

SEC. 510. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.

    The House adopts the provisions of this title--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of 
        Representatives and as such they shall be considered as part of 
        the rules of the House of Representatives, and these rules 
        shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are 
        inconsistent with other such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        the House of Representatives to change those rules at any time, 
        in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of 
        any other rule of the House of Representatives.

                      TITLE VI--POLICY STATEMENTS

SEC. 601. POLICY STATEMENT ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AND JOB CREATION.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Although the United States economy technically emerged 
        from recession nearly five years ago, the subsequent recovery 
        has felt more like a malaise than a rebound. Real gross 
        domestic product (GDP) growth over the past four years has 
        averaged just over 2 percent, well below the 3 percent trend 
        rate of growth in the United States.
            (2) The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) did a study in 
        late 2012 examining why the United States economy was growing 
        so slowly after the recession. They found, among other things, 
        that United States economic output was growing at less than 
        half of the typical rate exhibited during other recoveries 
        since World War II. CBO said that about two-thirds of this 
        ``growth gap'' was due to a pronounced sluggishness in the 
        growth of potential GDP--particularly in potential employment 
        levels (such as people leaving the labor force) and the growth 
        in productivity (which is in turn related to lower capital 
        investment).
            (3) The prolonged economic sluggishness is particularly 
        troubling given the amount of fiscal and monetary policy 
        actions taken in recent years to cushion the depth of the 
        downturn and to spark higher rates of growth and employment. In 
        addition to the large stimulus package passed in early 2009, 
        many other initiatives have been taken to boost growth, such as 
        the new homebuyer tax credit and the ``cash for clunkers'' 
        program. These stimulus efforts may have led to various short 
        term ``pops'' in activity but the economy and job market has 
        since reverted back to a sub-par trend.
            (4) The unemployment rate has declined in recent years, 
        from a peak of nearly 10 percent in 2009-2010 to 6.7 percent in 
        the latest month. However, a significant chunk of this decline 
        has been due to people leaving the labor force (and therefore 
        no longer being counted as ``unemployed'') and not from a surge 
        in employment. The slow decline in the unemployment rate in 
        recent years has occurred alongside a steep decline in the 
        economy's labor force participation rate. The participation 
        rate stands at 63.0 percent, close to the lowest level since 
        1978. The flipside of this is that over 90 million Americans 
        are now ``on the sidelines'' and not in the labor force, 
        representing a 10 million increase since early 2009.
            (5) Real median household income declined for the fifth 
        consecutive year in 2012 (latest data available) and, at just 
        over $51,000, is currently at its lowest level since 1995. Weak 
        wage and income growth as a result of a subpar labor market not 
        only means lower tax revenue coming in to the Treasury, it also 
        means higher government spending on income support programs.
            (6) A stronger economy is vital to lowering deficit levels 
        and eventually balancing the budget. According to CBO, if 
        annual real GDP growth is just 0.1 percentage point higher over 
        the budget window, deficits would be reduced by $311 billion.
            (7) This budget resolution therefore embraces pro-growth 
        policies, such as fundamental tax reform, that will help foster 
        a stronger economy and more job creation.
            (8) Reining in government spending and lowering budget 
        deficits has a positive long-term impact on the economy and the 
        budget. According to CBO, a significant deficit reduction 
        package (i.e. $4 trillion), would boost longer-term economic 
        output by 1.7 percent. Their analysis concludes that deficit 
        reduction creates long-term economic benefits because it 
        increases the pool of national savings and boosts investment, 
        thereby raising economic growth and job creation.
            (9) The greater economic output that stems from a large 
        deficit reduction package would have a sizeable impact on the 
        Federal budget. For instance, higher output would lead to 
        greater revenues through the increase in taxable incomes. Lower 
        interest rates, and a reduction in the stock of debt, would 
        lead to lower government spending on net interest expenses. 
        According to CBO, this dynamic would reduce unified budget 
        deficits by an amount sufficient to produce a surplus in fiscal 
        year 2024.
    (b) Policy on Economic Growth and Job Creation.--It is the policy 
of this resolution to promote faster economic growth and job creation. 
By putting the budget on a sustainable path, this resolution ends the 
debt-fueled uncertainty holding back job creators. Reforms to the tax 
code to put American businesses and workers in a better position to 
compete and thrive in the 21st century global economy. This resolution 
targets the regulatory red tape and cronyism that stack the deck in 
favor of special interests. All of the reforms in this resolution serve 
as means to the larger end of growing the economy and expanding 
opportunity for all Americans.

SEC. 602. POLICY STATEMENT ON TAX REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) A world-class tax system should be simple, fair, and 
        promote (rather than impede) economic growth. The United States 
        tax code fails on all three counts - it is notoriously complex, 
        patently unfair, and highly inefficient. The tax code's 
        complexity distorts decisions to work, save, and invest, which 
        leads to slower economic growth, lower wages, and less job 
        creation.
            (2) Over the past decade alone, there have been more than 
        4,400 changes to the tax code, more than one per day. Many of 
        the major changes over the years have involved carving out 
        special preferences, exclusions, or deductions for various 
        activities or groups. These loopholes add up to more than $1 
        trillion per year and make the code unfair, inefficient, and 
        highly complex.
            (3) In addition, these tax preferences are 
        disproportionately used by upper-income individuals.
            (4) The large amount of tax preferences that pervade the 
        code end up narrowing the tax base. A narrow tax base, in turn, 
        requires much higher tax rates to raise a given amount of 
        revenue.
            (5) It is estimated that American taxpayers end up spending 
        $160 billion and roughly 6 billion hours a year complying with 
        the tax code - a waste of time and resources that could be used 
        in more productive activities.
            (6) Standard economic theory shows that high marginal tax 
        rates dampen the incentives to work, save, and invest, which 
        reduces economic output and job creation. Lower economic 
        output, in turn, mutes the intended revenue gain from higher 
        marginal tax rates.
            (7) Roughly half of United States active business income 
        and half of private sector employment are derived from business 
        entities (such as partnerships, S corporations, and sole 
        proprietorships) that are taxed on a ``pass-through'' basis, 
        meaning the income flows through to the tax returns of the 
        individual owners and is taxed at the individual rate structure 
        rather than at the corporate rate. Small businesses, in 
        particular, tend to choose this form for Federal tax purposes, 
        and the top Federal rate on such small business income reaches 
        44.6 percent. For these reasons, sound economic policy requires 
        lowering marginal rates on these pass-through entities.
            (8) The United States corporate income tax rate (including 
        Federal, State, and local taxes) sums to just over 39 percent, 
        the highest rate in the industrialized world. Tax rates this 
        high suppress wages and discourage investment and job creation, 
        distort business activity, and put American businesses at a 
        competitive disadvantage with foreign competitors.
            (9) By deterring potential investment, the United States 
        corporate tax restrains economic growth and job creation. The 
        United States tax rate differential with other countries also 
        fosters a variety of complicated multinational corporate 
        behaviors intended to avoid the tax, which have the effect of 
        moving the tax base offshore, destroying American jobs, and 
        decreasing corporate revenue.
            (10) The ``worldwide'' structure of United States 
        international taxation essentially taxes earnings of United 
        States firms twice, putting them at a significant competitive 
        disadvantage with competitors with more competitive 
        international tax systems.
            (11) Reforming the United States tax code to a more 
        competitive international system would boost the 
        competitiveness of United States companies operating abroad and 
        it would also greatly reduce tax avoidance.
            (12) The tax code imposes costs on American workers through 
        lower wages, on consumers in higher prices, and on investors in 
        diminished returns.
            (13) Revenues have averaged about 17.5 percent of the 
        economy throughout modern American history. Revenues rise above 
        this level under current law to 18.4 percent of the economy by 
        the end of the 10-year budget window.
            (14) Attempting to raise revenue through tax increases to 
        meet out-of-control spending would damage the economy.
            (15) This resolution also rejects the idea of instituting a 
        carbon tax in the United States, which some have offered as a 
        ``new'' source of revenue. Such a plan would damage the 
        economy, cost jobs, and raise prices on American consumers.
            (16) Closing tax loopholes to fund spending does not 
        constitute fundamental tax reform.
            (17) The goal of tax reform should be to curb or eliminate 
        loopholes and use those savings to lower tax rates across the 
        board--not to fund more wasteful Government spending. Tax 
        reform should be revenue-neutral and should not be an excuse to 
        raise taxes on the American people. Washington has a spending 
        problem, not a revenue problem.
    (b) Policy on Tax Reform.--It is the policy of this resolution that 
Congress should enact legislation that provides for a comprehensive 
reform of the United States tax code to promote economic growth, create 
American jobs, increase wages, and benefit American consumers, 
investors, and workers through revenue-neutral fundamental tax reform 
that--
            (1) simplifies the tax code to make it fairer to American 
        families and businesses and reduces the amount of time and 
        resources necessary to comply with tax laws;
            (2) substantially lowers tax rates for individuals, with a 
        goal of achieving a top individual rate of 25 percent and 
        consolidating the current seven individual income tax brackets 
        into two brackets with a first bracket of 10 percent;
            (3) repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax;
            (4) reduces the corporate tax rate to 25 percent; and
            (5) transitions the tax code to a more competitive system 
        of international taxation.

SEC. 603. POLICY STATEMENT ON REPLACING THE PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE 
              LAW.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The President's health care law has failed to reduce 
        health care premiums as promised. Health care premiums were 
        supposed to decline by $2,500. Instead, according to the 2013 
        Employer Health Benefits Survey, health care premiums have 
        increased by 5 percent for individual plans and 4 percent for 
        family since 2012. Moreover, according to a report from the 
        Energy and Commerce Committee, premiums for individual market 
        plans may go up as much as 50 percent because of the law.
            (2) The President pledged that Americans would be able to 
        keep their health care plan if they liked it. But the non-
        partisan Congressional Budget Office now estimates 2 million 
        Americans with employment-based health coverage will lose those 
        plans.
            (3) Then-Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said that the 
        President's health care law would create 4 million jobs over 
        the life of the law and almost 400,000 jobs immediately. 
        Instead, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the law 
        will reduce full-time equivalent employment by about 2.0 
        million hours in 2017 and 2.5 million hours in 2024, ``compared 
        with what would have occurred in the absence of the ACA.''.
            (4) The implementation of the law has been a failure. The 
        main website that Americans were supposed to use in purchasing 
        new coverage was broken for over a month. Since the President's 
        health care law was signed into law, the Administration has 
        announced 23 delays. The President has also failed to submit 
        any nominees to sit on the Independent Payment Advisory Board, 
        a panel of bureaucrats that will cut Medicare by an additional 
        $12.1 billion over the next ten years, according to the 
        President's own budget.
            (5) The President's health care law should be repealed and 
        replaced with reforms that make affordable and quality health 
        care coverage available to all Americans.
    (b) Policy on Replacing the President's Health Care Law.--It is the 
policy of this resolution that the President's health care law must not 
only be repealed, but also replaced, for the following reasons:
            (1) The President's health care law is a government-run 
        system driving up health care costs and forcing Americans to 
        lose their health care coverage and should be replaced with a 
        reformed health care system that gives patients and their 
        doctors more choice and control over their health care.
            (2) Instead of a complex structure of subsidies, 
        ``firewalls,'' mandates, and penalties, a reformed health care 
        system should make health care coverage portable.
            (3) Instead of stifling innovation in health care 
        technologies, treatments, and medications through Federal 
        mandates, taxes, and price controls, a reformed health care 
        system should encourage research and development.
            (4) Instead of instituting one-size-fits-all directives 
        from Federal bureaucracies such as the Internal Revenue 
        Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the 
        Independent Payment Advisory Board, individuals and families 
        should be free to secure the health care coverage that best 
        meets their needs.
            (5) Instead of allowing fraudulent lawsuits, which are 
        driving up health care costs, the medical liability system 
        should be reformed while at the same time reaffirming that 
        States should be free to implement the policies that best suit 
        their needs.
            (6) Instead of using Federal taxes, mandates, and 
        bureaucracies to address those who have trouble securing health 
        care coverage, high risk pools should be established.
            (7) Instead of more than doubling spending on Medicaid, 
        which is driving up Federal debt and will eventually bankrupt 
        State budgets, Medicaid spending should be brought under 
        control and States should be given more flexibility to provide 
        quality, affordable care to those who are eligible.
            (8) Instead of driving up health care costs and reducing 
        employment, a reformed health care system should lower health 
        care costs, which will increase economic growth an employment 
        by lowering health care inflation.

SEC. 604. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on Medicare for 
        their health security.
            (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended 
        that Medicare's long-term financial challenges be addressed 
        soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of 
        Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in or 
        near retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the 
        Congressional Budget Office--
                    (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be 
                exhausted in 2026 and unable to pay scheduled benefits; 
                and
                    (B) Medicare spending is growing faster than the 
                economy and Medicare outlays are currently rising at a 
                rate of 6 percent per year over the next ten years, and 
                according to the Congressional Budget Office's 2013 
                Long-Term Budget Outlook, spending on Medicare is 
                projected to reach 5 percent of gross domestic product 
                (GDP) by 2040 and 9.4 percent of GDP by 2088.
            (3) The President's health care law created a new Federal 
        agency called the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) 
        empowered with unilateral authority to cut Medicare spending. 
        As a result of that law--
                    (A) IPAB will be tasked with keeping the Medicare 
                per capita growth below a Medicare per capita target 
                growth rate. Prior to 2018, the target growth rate is 
                based on the five-year average of overall inflation and 
                medical inflation. Beginning in 2018, the target growth 
                rate will be the five-year average increase in the 
                nominal GDP plus one percentage point, which the 
                President has twice proposed to reduce to GDP plus one-
                half percentage point;
                    (B) the fifteen unelected, unaccountable 
                bureaucrats of IPAB will make decisions that will 
                reduce seniors access to care;
                    (C) the nonpartisan Office of the Medicare Chief 
                Actuary estimates that the provider cuts already 
                contained in the Affordable Care Act will force 15 
                percent of hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and 
                home health agencies to become unprofitable in 2019; 
                and
                    (D) additional cuts from the IPAB board will force 
                even more health care providers to close their doors, 
                and the Board should be repealed.
            (4) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of 
        American seniors without adequate health security and younger 
        generations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending 
        levels that cannot be sustained.
    (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--It is the policy of this resolution 
to protect those in or near retirement from any disruptions to their 
Medicare benefits and offer future beneficiaries the same health care 
options available to Members of Congress.
    (c) Assumptions.--This resolution assumes reform of the Medicare 
program such that:
            (1) Current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in or 
        near retirement.
            (2) For future generations, when they reach eligibility, 
        Medicare is reformed to provide a premium support payment and a 
        selection of guaranteed health coverage options from which 
        recipients can choose a plan that best suits their needs.
            (3) Medicare will maintain traditional fee-for-service as 
        an option.
            (4) Medicare will provide additional assistance for lower-
        income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks.
            (5) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and the 
        Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term.

SEC. 605. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 55 million retirees, individuals with 
        disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Security. Since 
        enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg on the 
        ``three-legged stool'' of retirement security, which includes 
        employer provided pensions as well as personal savings.
            (2) The Social Security Trustees Report has repeatedly 
        recommended that Social Security's long-term financial 
        challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the 
        financial condition of Social Security becomes more precarious 
        and the threat to seniors and those receiving Social Security 
        disability benefits becomes more pronounced:
                    (A) In 2016, the Disability Insurance Trust Fund 
                will be exhausted and program revenues will be unable 
                to pay scheduled benefits.
                    (B) In 2033, the combined Old-Age and Survivors and 
                Disability Trust Funds will be exhausted, and program 
                revenues will be unable to pay scheduled benefits.
                    (C) With the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2033, 
                benefits will be cut nearly 25 percent across the 
                board, devastating those currently in or near 
                retirement and those who rely on Social Security the 
                most.
            (3) The recession and continued low economic growth have 
        exacerbated the looming fiscal crisis facing Social Security. 
        The most recent CBO projections find that Social Security will 
        run cash deficits of $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years.
            (4) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Security for a 
        larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore, 
        reforms should take into consideration the need to protect 
        lower-income Americans' retirement security.
            (5) The Disability Insurance program provides an essential 
        income safety net for those with disabilities and their 
        families. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), 
        between 1970 and 2012, the number of people receiving 
        disability benefits (both disabled workers and their dependent 
        family members) has increased by over 300 percent from 2.7 
        million to over 10.9 million. This increase is not due strictly 
        to population growth or decreases in health. David Autor and 
        Mark Duggan have found that the increase in individuals on 
        disability does not reflect a decrease in self-reported health. 
        CBO attributes program growth to changes in demographics, 
        changes in the composition of the labor force and compensation, 
        as well as Federal policies.
            (6) If this program is not reformed, families who rely on 
        the lifeline that disability benefits provide will face benefit 
        cuts of up to 25 percent in 2016, devastating individuals who 
        need assistance the most.
            (7) In the past, Social Security has been reformed on a 
        bipartisan basis, most notably by the ``Greenspan Commission'' 
        which helped to address Social Security shortfalls for over a 
        generation.
            (8) Americans deserve action by the President, the House, 
        and the Senate to preserve and strengthen Social Security. It 
        is critical that bipartisan action be taken to address the 
        looming insolvency of Social Security. In this spirit, this 
        resolution creates a bipartisan opportunity to find solutions 
        by requiring policymakers to ensure that Social Security 
        remains a critical part of the safety net.
    (b) Policy on Social Security.--It is the policy of this resolution 
that Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security 
sustainably solvent. This resolution assumes reform of a current law 
trigger, such that:
            (1) If in any year the Board of Trustees of the Federal 
        Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal 
        Disability Insurance Trust Fund annual Trustees Report 
        determines that the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social 
        Security Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of 
        the Social Security Trust Funds in the 75th year is in deficit, 
        the Board of Trustees shall, no later than September 30 of the 
        same calendar year, submit to the President recommendations for 
        statutory reforms necessary to achieve a positive 75-year 
        actuarial balance and a positive annual balance in the 75th-
        year. Recommendations provided to the President must be agreed 
        upon by both Public Trustees of the Board of Trustees.
            (2) Not later than December 1 of the same calendar year in 
        which the Board of Trustees submit their recommendations, the 
        President shall promptly submit implementing legislation to 
        both Houses of Congress including his recommendations necessary 
        to achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive 
        annual balance in the 75th year. The Majority Leader of the 
        Senate and the Majority Leader of the House shall introduce the 
        President's legislation upon receipt.
            (3) Within 60 days of the President submitting legislation, 
        the committees of jurisdiction to which the legislation has 
        been referred shall report the bill which shall be considered 
        by the full House or Senate under expedited procedures.
            (4) Legislation submitted by the President shall--
                    (A) protect those in or near retirement;
                    (B) preserve the safety net for those who count on 
                Social Security the most, including those with 
                disabilities and survivors;
                    (C) improve fairness for participants;
                    (D) reduce the burden on, and provide certainty 
                for, future generations; and
                    (E) secure the future of the Disability Insurance 
                program while addressing the needs of those with 
                disabilities today and improving the determination 
                process.
    (c) Policy on Disability Insurance.--It is the policy of this 
resolution that Congress and the President should enact legislation on 
a bipartisan basis to reform the Disability Insurance program prior to 
its insolvency in 2016 and should not raid the Social Security 
retirement system without reforms to the Disability Insurance system.

SEC. 606. POLICY STATEMENT ON HIGHER EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE 
              DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITY.

    (a) Findings on Higher Education.--The House finds the following:
            (1) A well-educated workforce is critical to economic, job, 
        and wage growth.
            (2) 19.5 million students are enrolled in American colleges 
        and universities.
            (3) Over the last decade, tuition and fees have been 
        growing at an unsustainable rate. Between the 2002-2003 
        Academic Year and the 2012-2013 Academic Year--
                    (A) published tuition and fees for in-State 
                students at public four-year colleges and universities 
                increased at an average rate of 5.2 percent per year 
                beyond the rate of general inflation;
                    (B) published tuition and fees for in-State 
                students at public two-year colleges and universities 
                increased at an average rate of 3.9 percent per year 
                beyond the rate of general inflation; and
                    (C) published tuition and fees for in-State 
                students at private four-year colleges and universities 
                increased at an average rate of 2.4 percent per year 
                beyond the rate of general inflation.
            (4) Over that same period, Federal financial aid has 
        increased 105 percent.
            (5) This spending has failed to make college more 
        affordable.
            (6) In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama 
        noted that, ``We can't just keep subsidizing skyrocketing 
        tuition; we'll run out of money.''.
            (7) American students are chasing ever-increasing tuition 
        with ever-increasing debt. According to the Federal Reserve 
        Bank of New York, student debt more than quadrupled between 
        2003 and 2013, and now stands at nearly $1.1 trillion. Student 
        debt now has the second largest balance after mortgage debt.
            (8) Students are carrying large debt loads and too many 
        fail to complete college or end up defaulting on these loans 
        due to their debt burden and a weak economy and job market.
            (9) Based on estimates from the Congressional Budget 
        Office, the Pell Grant Program will face a fiscal shortfall 
        beginning in fiscal year 2016 and continuing in each subsequent 
        year in the current budget window.
            (10) Failing to address these problems will jeopardize 
        access and affordability to higher education for America's 
        young people.
    (b) Policy on Higher Education Affordability.--It is the policy of 
this resolution to address the root drivers of tuition inflation, by--
            (1) targeting Federal financial aid to those most in need;
            (2) streamlining programs that provide aid to make them 
        more effective;
            (3) maintaining the maximum Pell grant award level at 
        $5,730 in each year of the budget window; and
            (4) removing regulatory barriers in higher education that 
        act to restrict flexibility and innovative teaching, 
        particularly as it relates to non-traditional models such as 
        online coursework and competency-based learning.
    (c) Findings on Workforce Development.--The House finds the 
following:
            (1) Over ten million Americans are currently unemployed.
            (2) Despite billions of dollars in spending, those looking 
        for work are stymied by a broken workforce development system 
        that fails to connect workers with assistance and employers 
        with trained personnel.
            (4) According to a 2011 Government Accountability Office 
        (GAO) report, in fiscal year 2009, the Federal Government spent 
        $18 billion across 9 agencies to administer 47 Federal job 
        training programs, almost all of which overlapped with another 
        program in terms of offered services and targeted population.
            (5) Since the release of that GAO report, the Education and 
        Workforce Committee, which has done extensive work in this 
        area, has identified more than 50 programs.
            (3) Without changes, this flawed system will continue to 
        fail those looking for work or to improve their skills, and 
        jeopardize economic growth.
    (d) Policy on Workforce Development.--It is the policy of this 
resolution to address the failings in the current workforce development 
system, by--
            (1) streamlining and consolidating Federal job training 
        programs as advanced by the House-passed Supporting Knowledge 
        and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act); and
            (2) empowering states with the flexibility to tailor 
        funding and programs to the specific needs of their workforce, 
        including the development of career scholarships.

SEC. 607. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE 
              CANCELLATION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) According to the most recent estimate from the Office 
        of Management and Budget, Federal agencies were expected to 
        hold $739 billion in unobligated balances at the close of 
        fiscal year 2014.
            (2) These funds represent direct and discretionary spending 
        made available by Congress that remains available for 
        expenditure beyond the fiscal year for which they are provided.
            (3) In some cases, agencies are granted funding and it 
        remains available for obligation indefinitely.
            (4) The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
        1974 requires the Office of Management and Budget to make funds 
        available to agencies for obligation and prohibits the 
        Administration from withholding or cancelling unobligated funds 
        unless approved by an act of Congress.
            (5) Greater congressional oversight is required to review 
        and identify potential savings from unneeded balances of funds.
    (b) Policy on Deficit Reduction Through the Cancellation of 
Unobligated Balances.--Congressional committees shall through their 
oversight activities identify and achieve savings through the 
cancellation or rescission of unobligated balances that neither 
abrogate contractual obligations of the Government nor reduce or 
disrupt Federal commitments under programs such as Social Security, 
veterans' affairs, national security, and Treasury authority to finance 
the national debt.
    (c) Deficit Reduction.--Congress, with the assistance of the 
Government Accountability Office, the Inspectors General, and other 
appropriate agencies should continue to make it a high priority to 
review unobligated balances and identify savings for deficit reduction.

SEC. 608. POLICY STATEMENT ON RESPONSIBLE STEWARDSHIP OF TAXPAYER 
              DOLLARS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The budget for the House of Representatives is $188 
        million less than it was when Republicans became the majority 
        in 2011.
            (2) The House of Representatives has achieved significant 
        savings by consolidating operations and renegotiating 
        contracts.
    (b) Policy on Responsible Stewardship of Taxpayer Dollars.--It is 
the policy of this resolution that:
            (1) The House of Representatives must be a model for the 
        responsible stewardship of taxpayer resources and therefore 
        must identify any savings that can be achieved through greater 
        productivity and efficiency gains in the operation and 
        maintenance of House services and resources like printing, 
        conferences, utilities, telecommunications, furniture, grounds 
        maintenance, postage, and rent. This should include a review of 
        policies and procedures for acquisition of goods and services 
        to eliminate any unnecessary spending. The Committee on House 
        Administration should review the policies pertaining to the 
        services provided to Members and committees of the House, and 
        should identify ways to reduce any subsidies paid for the 
        operation of the House gym, barber shop, salon, and the House 
        dining room.
            (2) No taxpayer funds may be used to purchase first class 
        airfare or to lease corporate jets for Members of Congress.
            (3) Retirement benefits for Members of Congress should not 
        include free, taxpayer-funded health care for life.

SEC. 609. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE REDUCTION 
              OF UNNECESSARY AND WASTEFUL SPENDING.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The Government Accountability Office (``GAO'') is 
        required by law to identify examples of waste, duplication, and 
        overlap in Federal programs, and has so identified dozens of 
        such examples.
            (2) In testimony before the Committee on Oversight and 
        Government Reform, the Comptroller General has stated that 
        addressing the identified waste, duplication, and overlap in 
        Federal programs ``could potentially save tens of billions of 
        dollars.''
            (3) In 2011, 2012, and 2013 the Government Accountability 
        Office issued reports showing excessive duplication and 
        redundancy in Federal programs including--
                    (A) 209 Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
                Mathematics education programs in 13 different Federal 
                agencies at a cost of $3 billion annually;
                    (B) 200 separate Department of Justice crime 
                prevention and victim services grant programs with an 
                annual cost of $3.9 billion in 2010;
                    (C) 20 different Federal entities administer 160 
                housing programs and other forms of Federal assistance 
                for housing with a total cost of $170 billion in 2010;
                    (D) 17 separate Homeland Security preparedness 
                grant programs that spent $37 billion between fiscal 
                year 2011 and 2012;
                    (E) 14 grant and loan programs, and 3 tax benefits 
                to reduce diesel emissions;
                    (F) 94 different initiatives run by 11 different 
                agencies to encourage ``green building'' in the private 
                sector; and
                    (G) 23 agencies implemented approximately 670 
                renewable energy initiatives in fiscal year 2010 at a 
                cost of nearly $15 billion.
            (4) The Federal Government spends about $80 billion each 
        year for approximately 800 information technology investments. 
        GAO has identified broad acquisition failures, waste, and 
        unnecessary duplication in the Government's information 
        technology infrastructure. Experts have estimated that 
        eliminating these problems could save 25 percent - or $20 
        billion - of the Government's annual information technology 
        budget.
            (5) GAO has identified strategic sourcing as a potential 
        source of spending reductions. In 2011 GAO estimated that 
        saving 10 percent of the total or all Federal procurement could 
        generate over $50 billion in savings annually.
            (6) Federal agencies reported an estimated $108 billion in 
        improper payments in fiscal year 2012.
            (7) Under clause 2 of Rule XI of the Rules of the House of 
        Representatives, each standing committee must hold at least one 
        hearing during each 120 day period following its establishment 
        on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in Government 
        programs.
            (8) According to the Congressional Budget Office, by fiscal 
        year 2015, 32 laws will expire, possibly resulting in $693 
        billion in unauthorized appropriations. Timely reauthorizations 
        of these laws would ensure assessments of program justification 
        and effectiveness.
            (9) The findings resulting from congressional oversight of 
        Federal Government programs should result in programmatic 
        changes in both authorizing statutes and program funding 
        levels.
    (b) Policy on Deficit Reduction Through the Reduction of 
Unnecessary and Wasteful Spending.--Each authorizing committee annually 
shall include in its Views and Estimates letter required under section 
301(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 recommendations to the 
Committee on the Budget of programs within the jurisdiction of such 
committee whose funding should be reduced or eliminated.

SEC. 610. POLICY STATEMENT ON UNAUTHORIZED SPENDING.

    It is the policy of this resolution that the committees of 
jurisdiction should review all unauthorized programs funded through 
annual appropriations to determine if the programs are operating 
efficiently and effectively. Committees should reauthorize those 
programs that in the committees' judgment should continue to receive 
funding.

SEC. 611. POLICY STATEMENT ON FEDERAL REGULATORY POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Excessive regulation at the Federal level has hurt job 
        creation and dampened the economy, slowing our recovery from 
        the economic recession.
            (2) In the first two months of 2014 alone, the 
        Administration issued 13,166 pages of regulations imposing more 
        than $13 billion in compliance costs on job creators and adding 
        more than 16 million hours of compliance paperwork.
            (3) The Small Business Administration estimates that the 
        total cost of regulations is as high as $1.75 trillion per 
        year. Since 2009, the White House has generated over $494 
        billion in regulatory activity, with an additional $87.6 
        billion in regulatory costs currently pending.
            (4) The Dodd-Frank financial services legislation (Public 
        Law 111-203) resulted in more than $17 billion in compliance 
        costs and saddled job creators with more than 58 million hours 
        of compliance paperwork.
            (5) Implementation of the Affordable Care Act to date has 
        added 132.9 million annual hours of compliance paperwork, 
        imposing $24.3 billion of compliance costs on the private 
        sector and an $8 billion cost burden on the states.
            (6) The highest regulatory costs come from rules issued by 
        the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); these regulations 
        are primarily targeted at the coal industry. In September 2013, 
        the EPA proposed a rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions 
        from new coal-fired power plants. The proposed standards are 
        unachievable with current commercially available technology, 
        resulting in a de-facto ban on new coal-fired power plants. 
        Additional regulations for existing coal plants are expected in 
        the summer of 2014.
            (7) Coal-fired power plants provide roughly forty percent 
        of the United States electricity at a low cost. Unfairly 
        targeting the coal industry with costly and unachievable 
        regulations will increase energy prices, disproportionately 
        disadvantaging energy-intensive industries like manufacturing 
        and construction, and will make life more difficult for 
        millions of low-income and middle class families already 
        struggling to pay their bills.
            (8) Three hundred and thirty coal units are being retired 
        or converted as a result of EPA regulations. Combined with the 
        de-facto prohibition on new plants, these retirements and 
        conversions may further increase the cost of electricity.
            (9) A recent study by Purdue University estimates that 
        electricity prices in Indiana will rise 32 percent by 2023, due 
        in part to EPA regulations.
            (10) The Heritage Foundation recently found that a phase 
        out of coal would cost 600,000 jobs by the end of 2023, 
        resulting in an aggregate gross domestic product decrease of 
        $2.23 trillion over the entire period and reducing the income 
        of a family of four by $1200 per year. Of these jobs, 330,000 
        will come from the manufacturing sector, with California, 
        Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, 
        Indiana, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and Georgia seeing the 
        highest job losses.
    (b) Policy on Federal Regulation.--It is the policy of this 
resolution that Congress should, in consultation with the public 
burdened by excessive regulation, enact legislation that--
            (1) seeks to promote economic growth and job creation by 
        eliminating unnecessary red tape and streamlining and 
        simplifying Federal regulations;
            (2) pursues a cost-effective approach to regulation, 
        without sacrificing environmental, health, safety benefits or 
        other benefits, rejecting the premise that economic growth and 
        environmental protection create an either/or proposition;
            (3) ensures that regulations do not disproportionately 
        disadvantage low-income Americans through a more rigorous cost-
        benefit analysis, which also considers who will be most 
        affected by regulations and whether the harm caused is 
        outweighed by the potential harm prevented;
            (4) ensures that regulations are subject to an open and 
        transparent process, rely on sound and publicly available 
        scientific data, and that the data relied upon for any 
        particular regulation is provided to Congress immediately upon 
        request;
            (5) frees the many commonsense energy and water projects 
        currently trapped in complicated bureaucratic approval 
        processes;
            (6) maintains the benefits of landmark environmental, 
        health safety, and other statutes while scaling back this 
        administration's heavy-handed approach to regulation, which has 
        added $494 billion in mostly ideological regulatory activity 
        since 2009, much of which flies in the face of these statutes' 
        intended purposes; and
            (7) seeks to promote a limited government, which will 
        unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs, 
        providing our Nation with a strong and prosperous future and 
        expanding opportunities for the generations to come.

SEC. 612. POLICY STATEMENT ON TRADE.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) Opening foreign markets to American exports is vital to 
        the United States economy and beneficial to American workers 
        and consumers. The Commerce Department estimates that every $1 
        billion of United States exports supports more than 5,000 jobs 
        here at home.
            (2) A modern and competitive international tax system would 
        facilitate global commerce for United States multinational 
        companies and would encourage foreign business investment and 
        job creation in the United States
            (3) The United States currently has an antiquated system of 
        international taxation whereby United States multinationals 
        operating abroad pay both the foreign-country tax and United 
        States corporate taxes. They are essentially taxed twice. This 
        puts them at an obvious competitive disadvantage.
            (4) The ability to defer United States taxes on their 
        foreign operations, which some erroneously refer to as a ``tax 
        loophole,'' cushions this disadvantage to a certain extent. 
        Eliminating or restricting this provision (and others like it) 
        would harm United States competitiveness.
            (5) This budget resolution advocates fundamental tax reform 
        that would lower the United States corporate rate, now the 
        highest in the industrialized world, and switch to a more 
        competitive system of international taxation. This would make 
        the United States a much more attractive place to invest and 
        station business activity and would chip away at the incentives 
        for United States companies to keep their profits overseas 
        (because the United States corporate rate is so high).
            (6) The status quo of the current tax code undermines the 
        competitiveness of United States businesses and costs the 
        United States economy investment and jobs.
            (7) Global trade and commerce is not a zero-sum game. The 
        idea that global expansion tends to ``hollow out'' United 
        States operations is incorrect. Foreign-affiliate activity 
        tends to complement, not substitute for, key parent activities 
        in the United States such as employment, worker compensation, 
        and capital investment. When United States headquartered 
        multinationals invest and expand operations abroad it often 
        leads to more jobs and economic growth at home.
            (8) American businesses and workers have shown that, on a 
        level playing field, they can excel and surpass the 
        international competition.
    (b) Policy on Trade.--It is the policy of this resolution to pursue 
international trade, global commerce, and a modern and competitive 
United States international tax system in order to promote job creation 
in the United States.

SEC. 613. NO BUDGET, NO PAY.

    It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should agree to a 
concurrent resolution on the budget every year pursuant to section 301 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. If by April 15, a House of 
Congress has not agreed to a concurrent resolution on the budget, the 
payroll administrator of that House should carry out this policy in the 
same manner as the provisions of Public Law 113-3, the No Budget, No 
Pay Act of 2013, and place in an escrow account all compensation 
otherwise required to be made for Members of that House of Congress. 
Withheld compensation should be released to Members of that House of 
Congress the earlier of the day on which that House of Congress agrees 
to a concurrent resolution on the budget, pursuant to section 301 of 
the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, or the last day of that Congress.
