                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress regarding outreach to families of 
 members of the Armed Forces killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan, 
                        and in other conflicts.

Whereas the human burden of the Global War on Terrorism has been 
        disproportionately borne by the less than one percent of Americans who 
        serve in the military;
Whereas 2,276 members of the Armed Forces have been killed in Afghanistan and 
        4,474 members of the Armed Forces killed in Iraq as of November 11th, 
        2013;
Whereas the strength of our military is built upon the men and women who serve 
        in uniform and the families who support them; and
Whereas supporting those families who have lost loved ones in the Global War on 
        Terrorism demonstrates the commitment of the American people to those 
        families now and in the future: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) all families that have lost loved ones in uniform 
        should be recognized for their sacrifices and for their 
        dedicated and patriotic support of the United States;
            (2) local communities should recognize and support those 
        families that have lost a loved one in combat; and
            (3) the President should encourage military bases around 
        the country to organize and host events to recognize and 
        commemorate the sacrifices of members of the Armed Forces of 
        all services, and to encourage the attendance of families 
        within the local area that have lost loved ones in combat to 
        attend such commemorations.
                                 <all>
