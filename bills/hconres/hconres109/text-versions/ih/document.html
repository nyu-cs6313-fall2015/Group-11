                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress relating to extending the interim 
  agreement with the Government of Iran regarding its nuclear program.

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) expresses concern with respect to extending the 
        deadline of the interim agreement to November 24, 2014, between 
        members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany 
        (``P5+1'') and the Government of Iran, due to all indications 
        pointing to Iran's unwillingness to make significant nuclear 
        concessions by the interim deadline of July 20, 2014;
            (2) reaffirms that the United States should continue to 
        vigorously enforce existing sanctions on Iran and reaffirms the 
        role of Congress on lifting congressionally mandated sanctions 
        on Iran, including those sanctions that require Iran's 
        permanent and verifiable termination of activities related to 
        its nuclear program, ballistic missile program, and support for 
        international terrorism;
            (3) requests the Administration to begin immediate 
        substantive consultations with Congress concerning what an 
        acceptable comprehensive agreement must include and any 
        potential sanctions relief package;
            (4) reiterates that the policy of the United States is to 
        prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons' capability and 
        expresses that a comprehensive nuclear agreement verifiably 
        ensures that Iran is denied an undetectable nuclear weapons 
        breakout capability and verifiably dismantles and prevents 
        Iran's ability to acquire or develop a nuclear weapons' 
        capability;
            (5) declares that new sanctions will be enacted and the 
        arsenal of all legislative options will be evaluated for 
        enactment if Iran breaks its commitments in the interim 
        agreement or a comprehensive agreement or if negotiations fail 
        to achieve a comprehensive agreement regarding its nuclear 
        program by the final deadline of November 24, 2014;
            (6) reaffirms that the United States is ready and capable 
        of defending itself and its allies with respect to preventing 
        Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons' capability;
            (7) reaffirms that the United States has a vital national 
        interest in, and unbreakable commitment to, ensuring the 
        existence, survival, and security of the State of Israel, and 
        reaffirms United States support for Israel's right to self-
        defense; and
            (8) urges the President, the Secretary of State, and world 
        leaders--
                    (A) to express support for the universal rights and 
                freedoms of the people of Iran, including to democratic 
                self-government;
                    (B) to broaden engagement with the people of Iran 
                and support efforts in the country to help promote 
                human rights and democratic reform; and
                    (C) to prevent Iran's support for terrorist groups, 
                including Hamas and Hezbollah.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
