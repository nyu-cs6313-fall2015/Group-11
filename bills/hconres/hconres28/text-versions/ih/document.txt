                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the significance of Equal Pay Day to illustrate the 
             disparity between wages paid to men and women.

Whereas section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 
        206(d)(1)) prohibits discrimination in compensation for equal work on 
        the basis of sex;
Whereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) 
        prohibits discrimination in compensation because of race, color, 
        religion, national origin, or sex;
Whereas five decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 
        206 note), the Bureau of the Census estimates that women working full 
        time, year round are paid an overall average of 77 cents for every 
        dollar paid to men, while Asian-American women working full time, year 
        round are paid 78 cents, African-American women working full time, year 
        round are paid 64 cents, and Hispanic women working full time, year 
        round are paid 55 cents compared to White, non-Hispanic men;
Whereas sex discrimination in hiring and promotion has played a role in 
        maintaining a work force segregated by sex;
Whereas wage differentials that exist between equivalent jobs segregated by 
        sex--(1) depress wages and living standards for employees necessary for 
        their health and efficiency; (2) reduce family incomes and contribute to 
        the higher poverty rates among women and female-headed households; (3) 
        prevent the maximum utilization of the available labor resources; (4) 
        tend to cause labor disputes, thereby burdening, affecting, and 
        obstructing commerce; and (5) constitute an unfair method of 
        competition;
Whereas opening traditionally male jobs to women and reducing occupational 
        segregation by sex increases earnings for women;
Whereas when women are paid fairly, families are stronger, business prospers, 
        and American values and the economy are strengthened;
Whereas fair pay strengthens the security of families and enhances retirement;
Whereas nearly two-thirds of workers paid the minimum wage are women and the 
        concentration of women in low-wage jobs is a significant contributor to 
        the wage gap;
Whereas nearly 50 percent of employers either prohibit or strongly discourage 
        workers from discussing their pay, which keeps women from learning when 
        they are the victims of pay discrimination and remedying that 
        discrimination;
Whereas April 9, 2013, is Equal Pay Day, marking the day that symbolizes how far 
        into 2013 women must work until their pay from 2012 equals what men were 
        paid in 2012 alone; and
Whereas numerous national organizations have designated Tuesday, April 9, 2013, 
        as Equal Pay Day to represent the additional time that women must work 
        to compensate for the average 23 percent lower wages paid to women last 
        year: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress recognizes the significance of Equal Pay Day to 
illustrate the disparity between wages paid to men and women.
