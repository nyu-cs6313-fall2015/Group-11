                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of June 21 as National ASK (Asking 
      Saves Kids) Day to promote children's health and gun safety.

Whereas on average in 2010, 1 child under the age of 15 died every 6 days due to 
        the unintentional discharge of a firearm;
Whereas according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, in 2012, approximately 667 children sustained nonfatal 
        injuries from the unintentional discharge of a firearm;
Whereas in States that collect data through the National Violent Death Reporting 
        System, on average, 80 percent of unintentional firearm deaths of 
        children under 15 occurred in a home;
Whereas the ASK Campaign encourages parents to add one more question to a 
        conversation before their child visits other homes, ``Is there an 
        unlocked gun in your house?'';
Whereas the ASK Campaign was first established by the American Academy of 
        Pediatrics (AAP) and the Center to Prevent Youth Violence along with 
        other partners in 2000;
Whereas the President of the AAP has said ``keeping children and teens safe from 
        preventable injuries is one of the most important things we do as 
        pediatricians'';
Whereas according to the National Rifle Association's Parents Guide to Gun 
        Safety, ``Parental responsibility does not end, however, when the child 
        leaves the home . . . Even if no one in your family owns a gun, chances 
        are that someone you know does. Your child could come in contact with a 
        gun at a neighbor's house, when playing with friends, or under other 
        circumstances outside your home'';
Whereas asking this simple question about gun safety before sending your child 
        to play at another home could help save your child's life;
Whereas June 21, the first day of summer, the season in which kids typically 
        spend more time at a friend's or family member's home, has traditionally 
        been designated as National ASK Day; and
Whereas June 21, 2014, has been designated by national organizations as the 14th 
        annual National ASK Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports designation of National ASK (Asking Saves 
        Kids) Day to encourage parents to begin asking this life-saving 
        question; and
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National ASK Day.
