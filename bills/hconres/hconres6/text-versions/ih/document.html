                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of Congress that the Supreme Court misinterpreted 
   the First Amendment to the Constitution in the case of Buckley v. 
                                 Valeo.

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that the Supreme Court misinterpreted 
the First Amendment to the Constitution in its decision in the 1976 
case of Buckley v. Valeo because--
            (1) the decision failed to recognize that the unlimited 
        spending of large amounts of money on elections has a corrosive 
        effect on the electoral process not simply because of direct 
        transactions between those who give large amounts of money and 
        candidates and elected officials but because the presence of 
        unlimited amounts of money corrupts the process on a more 
        fundamental level; and
            (2) the decision failed to recognize other legitimate state 
        interests which justify limiting money in campaigns, including 
        the need to preserve the integrity of our republican form of 
        government, restore public confidence in government, and ensure 
        all citizens a more equal opportunity to participate in the 
        political process.
