                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
              Supporting Rare Pituitary Disease Awareness.

Whereas rare pituitary diseases are those which affect small patient 
        populations, typically populations smaller than 2-3 cases per million 
        individuals in the United States;
Whereas many rare pituitary diseases are serious, life-threatening, and have 
        limited treatment options;
Whereas rare pituitary diseases and conditions include but are not limited to 
        both Cushing's disease and Acromegaly;
Whereas people with rare pituitary disease experience challenges such as 
        difficulty in obtaining an accurate diagnosis, limited treatment 
        options, difficulty finding physicians or treatment centers with 
        expertise in their disease, diminished quality of life and physical 
        function if untreated;
Whereas there is a high need for medical education that will address the 
        specific needs of patients with rare pituitary diseases, increase the 
        speed of diagnosis and a number of correctly diagnosed patients;
Whereas there have been great strides made in research and treatment due to the 
        Orphan Drug Act of 1983;
Whereas Rare Pituitary Disease Awareness helps to increase public awareness and 
        understanding of rare pituitary diseases;
Whereas there are a number of rare disease awareness initiatives for various 
        rare conditions recognized on both State and Federal levels but none for 
        rare pituitary disorders;
Whereas Rare Pituitary Disease Awareness is anticipated to be observed globally 
        in years to come, to provide hope and information for patients afflicted 
        by Cushing's disease, Acromegaly and other pituitary diseases around the 
        world; and
Whereas both the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of 
        Health have established special offices to advocate for rare disease 
        research and treatments: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That the Congress--
            (1) supports Rare Pituitary Disease Awareness;
            (2) recognizes the importance of improving awareness and 
        encouraging accurate and early diagnosis of Cushing's disease, 
        Acromegaly and other rare pituitary diseases; and
            (3) supports a substantial national commitment to improving 
        diagnostics and cures for rare pituitary diseases and quality 
        of life for patients afflicted by these rare conditions.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
