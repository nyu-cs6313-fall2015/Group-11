                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the need for investigation 
 and prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, 
 whether committed by officials of the Government of Syria, or members 
  of other groups involved in civil war in Syria, and calling on the 
  President to direct the United States representative to the United 
 Nations to use the voice and vote of the United States to immediately 
  promote the establishment of a Syrian war crimes tribunal, and for 
                            other purposes.

Whereas the Government of Syria is reported to have engaged in widespread 
        torture, rape, and massacre of civilians, including by means of chemical 
        weapons, most recently on or about August 21, 2013;
Whereas other groups involved in civil war in Syria, including the al-Nusra 
        Front, are reported to have engaged in torture, rape, summary execution 
        of government soldiers, kidnapping for ransom, and violence against 
        civilians, including Christians and others who are not Sunni Muslims;
Whereas these and other actions perpetrated by the Government of Syria and other 
        groups involved in civil war in Syria may constitute war crimes, crimes 
        against humanity, and genocide;
Whereas Syria is not a state-party to the Rome Statute and is not a member of 
        the International Criminal Court;
Whereas the international community has previously established ad hoc tribunals 
        through the United Nations to bring justice in specific countries where 
        there have been war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide;
Whereas ad hoc tribunals, including the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
        former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and 
        the Special Court for Sierra Leone, have successfully investigated and 
        prosecuted war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, and there 
        are many positive lessons to be learned from these three ad hoc 
        tribunals; and
Whereas any lasting, peaceful solution to civil war in Syria must be based upon 
        justice for all, including members of all factions, political parties, 
        ethnicities, and religions: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring),

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This concurrent resolution may be cited as the ``Immediate 
Establishment of Syrian War Crimes Tribunal Resolution''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should urge the Government of Syria 
        and other groups involved in civil war in Syria to implement an 
        immediate cease fire and engage in negotiations to end the 
        bloodshed;
            (2) the United States should publicly declare that it is a 
        requirement of basic justice that war crimes, crimes against 
        humanity, and genocide, whether committed by officials of the 
        Government of Syria, or members of other groups involved in 
        civil war in Syria, should be investigated and prosecuted;
            (3) the President should direct the United States 
        representative to the United Nations to use the voice and vote 
        of the United States to immediately promote the establishment 
        of a Syrian war crimes tribunal, an ad hoc court to prosecute 
        the perpetrators of such serious crimes committed during the 
        civil war in Syria;
            (4) in working with other countries to establish a Syrian 
        war crimes tribunal, the United States should promote judicial 
        procedures that enable the prosecution of the most culpable 
        persons guilty of directing such serious crimes;
            (5) the United States should make collection of information 
        that can be supplied to a Syrian war crimes tribunal for use as 
        evidence to support the indictment and trial of any person 
        involved in civil war in Syria and responsible for war crimes, 
        crimes against humanity, or genocide in Syria an immediate 
        priority; and
            (6) the United States should urge other interested states 
        to apprehend and deliver into the custody of a Syrian war 
        crimes tribunal persons indicted for war crimes, crimes against 
        humanity, or genocide in Syria and urge such states to provide 
        information pertaining to such crimes to the tribunal.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
