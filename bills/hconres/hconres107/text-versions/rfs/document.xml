			 Law of War or Law of Armed Conflict);</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Additional Protocol I, Article 50(1) to the Geneva Convention defines <quote>civilian</quote> as, <quote>[a]ny person who does not belong to one of the categories of persons referred to in Article 4(A)

			 Protocol. In the case of doubt whether a person is a civilian, that person
			 shall be considered a civilian.</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Additional Protocol I, Article 51(7) to the Geneva Convention states, <quote>[T]he presence or movement of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to
			 render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in
			 particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to
			 shield, favour or impede military operations. The Parties to the conflict

			 civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attacks
			 or to shield military operations.</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas since June 15, 2014, there have been over 2,000 rockets fired by Hamas and other terrorist
			 organizations from Gaza into Israel;</text>

			 batteries in densely populated areas and near schools, hospitals, and
			 mosques;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Israel drops leaflets, makes announcements, places phone calls and sends text messages to
			 the Palestinian people in Gaza warning them in advance that an attack is
			 imminent, and goes to extraordinary lengths to target only terrorist
			 actors;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Hamas has urged the residents of Gaza to ignore the Israeli warnings and to remain in their
			 houses and has encouraged Palestinians to gather on the roofs of their
			 homes to act as human shields;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on July 23, 2014, the 46-Member UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution to form a
			 commission of inquiry over Israel’s operations in Gaza without a single
			 mention of the indiscriminate rocket attacks by Hamas or the use of human
			 shields, with the United States being the lone dissenting vote;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas public reports have cited the role of Iran and Syria in providing material support and
			 training to Hamas and other terrorist groups carrying out rocket and
			 mortar attacks from Gaza;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas throughout the summer of 2006 conflict between the State of Israel and the terrorist
			 organization Hezbollah, Hezbollah forces utilized human shields in
			 violation of international humanitarian law;</text>

			 terrorist organizations typically use innocent civilians as human shields;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States and Israel have cooperated on missile defense projects, including Iron
			 Dome, David's Sling, and the Arrow Anti-Missile System, projects designed
			 to thwart a diverse range of threats, including short-range missiles and
			 rockets fired by non-state actors, such as Hamas;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States has provided $235,000,000 in fiscal year 2014 for Iron Dome research,

			 dozens of rockets that were launched against Israeli population centers;
			 and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 5 million Israelis are currently living under the threat of rocket attacks from Gaza: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text>
