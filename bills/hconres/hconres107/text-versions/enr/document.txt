                          Concurrent Resolution

Whereas the use of human shields is unconscionable and morally 
  unacceptable;

Whereas since June 15, 2014, there have been over 2,000 rockets fired 
  by Hamas and other terrorist organizations from Gaza into Israel;

Whereas Hamas uses civilian populations as human shields by placing 
  their missile batteries in densely populated areas and near schools, 
  hospitals, and mosques;

Whereas Israel dropped leaflets, made announcements, placed phone 
  calls, and sent text messages to the Palestinian people in Gaza 
  warning them in advance that an attack was imminent, and went to 
  extraordinary lengths to target only terrorist actors and to minimize 
  collateral damage;

Whereas Hamas urged the residents of Gaza to ignore the Israeli 
  warnings and to remain in their houses and encouraged Palestinians to 
  gather on the roofs of their homes to act as human shields;

Whereas on July 23, 2014, the 46-Member UN Human Rights Council passed 
  a resolution to form a commission of inquiry over Israel's operations 
  in Gaza that completely fails to condemn Hamas for its indiscriminate 
  rocket attacks and its unconscionable use of human shields, with the 
  United States being the lone dissenting vote;

Whereas public reports have cited the role of Iran and Syria in 
  providing material support and training to Hamas and other terrorist 
  groups carrying out rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza;

Whereas throughout the summer of 2006 conflict between the State of 
  Israel and the terrorist organization Hezbollah, Hezbollah forces 
  utilized innocent civilians as human shields;

Whereas al Qaeda, Al-Shabaab, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant 
  (ISIL), and other foreign terrorist organizations typically use 
  innocent civilians as human shields;

Whereas the United States and Israel have cooperated on missile defense 
  projects, including Iron Dome, David's Sling, and the Arrow Anti-
  Missile System, projects designed to thwart a diverse range of 
  threats, including short-range missiles and rockets fired by non-
  state actors, such as Hamas;

Whereas the United States provided $460,000,000 in fiscal year 2014 for 
  Iron Dome research, development, and production;

Whereas during the most recent rocket attacks from Gaza, Iron Dome 
  successfully intercepted dozens of rockets that were launched against 
  Israeli population centers; and

Whereas 5,000,000 Israelis are currently living under the threat of 
  rocket attacks from Gaza: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
        (1) strongly condemns the use of innocent civilians as human 
    shields;
        (2) calls on the international community to recognize and 
    condemn Hamas' use of human shields;
        (3) places responsibility for the rocket attacks against Israel 
    on Hamas and other terrorist organizations, such as Palestine 
    Islamic Jihad;
        (4) supports the sovereign right of the Government of Israel to 
    defend its territory and its citizens from Hamas' rocket attacks, 
    kidnapping attempts, and the use of tunnels and other means to 
    carry out attacks against Israel;
        (5) expresses condolences to the families of the innocent 
    victims on both sides of the conflict;
        (6) supports Palestinian civilians who reject Hamas and all 
    forms of terrorism and violence, desiring to live in peace with 
    their Israeli neighbors;
        (7) supports efforts to demilitarize the Gaza Strip, removing 
    Hamas's means to target Israel, including its use of tunnels, 
    rockets, and other means; and
        (8) condemns the United Nations Human Rights Council's biased 
    resolution establishing a commission of inquiry into Israel's Gaza 
    operations.
Attest:

                                 Clerk of the House of Representatives.
