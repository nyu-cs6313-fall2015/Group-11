                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for designation of October 28, annually, as 
            ``Honoring the Nation's First Responders Day''.

Whereas the term first responders includes all fire, police, EMT, and volunteer 
        first responder workers in the United States;
Whereas there are over 25,300,000 first responders in the United States today, 
        working to keep our communities safe;
Whereas first responders, both professional and volunteer, deserve to be 
        recognized for their commitment to safety, defense, and honor; and
Whereas October 28 would be an appropriate day to establish as ``Honoring the 
        Nation's First Responders Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Honoring the Nation's 
        First Responders Day'';
            (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of volunteer 
        firefighters, policemen, and other service men and women; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``Honoring the Nation's First Responders Day'' with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities that promote awareness of the 
        contributions of the Nation's First Responders.
                                 <all>
