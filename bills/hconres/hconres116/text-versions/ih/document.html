                           September 18, 2014

 Mr. Kilmer (for himself, Mr. Courtney, Mr. Langevin, Mr. Forbes, and

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the Sailors of the United States Submarine Force upon 
 the completion of 4,000 ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) deterrent 
                                patrols.

Whereas the Sailors of the United States Submarine Force recently completed the 
        4,000th deterrent patrol of a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN);
Whereas this milestone is significant for the Submarine Force, its crews and 
        their families, the United States Navy, and the entire country;
Whereas this milestone was reached through the combined efforts and impressive 
        achievements of all of the submariners who have participated in such 
        patrols since the first patrol of USS George Washington (SSBN 598) in 
        1960;
Whereas, as a result of the dedication and commitment to excellence of the 
        Sailors of the United States Submarine Force, ballistic missile 
        submarines have always been ready and vigilant, reassuring United States 
        allies and deterring anyone who might seek to do harm to the United 
        States or United States allies;
Whereas the national maritime strategy of the United States recognizes the 
        critical need for strategic deterrence in today's uncertain world;
Whereas the true strength of the ballistic missile submarine lies in the 
        extremely talented and motivated Sailors who have voluntarily chosen to 
        serve in the submarine community; and
Whereas the inherent stealth, unparalleled firepower, and nearly limitless 
        endurance of the ballistic missile submarine provide a credible 
        deterrence for any enemies that would seek to use force against the 
        United States or United States allies: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) congratulates the Sailors of the United States 
        Submarine Force upon the completion of 4,000 ballistic missile 
        submarine (SSBN) deterrent patrols; and
            (2) honors and thanks the crews of ballistic missile 
        submarines and their devoted families for their continued 
        dedication and sacrifice.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
