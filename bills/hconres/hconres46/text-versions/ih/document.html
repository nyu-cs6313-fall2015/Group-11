                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Urging the Government of Taiwan to grant former President Chen Shui-
  bian medical parole to ensure that he receives the highest level of 
                           medical attention.

Whereas Taiwan's democratic development is of tremendous significance globally 
        and to the Pacific region;
Whereas over the past two decades, the people of Taiwan have worked hard to 
        establish a vibrant and pluralistic democracy in their country and 
        conducted five successful presidential elections, successive elections 
        for members of their national legislature, numerous local elections, and 
        two national referendums;
Whereas since the administration of the Kuomintang Nationalists came to office 
        in 2008, a large number of investigations and prosecutions led by the 
        Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have been brought against officials 
        from the previous administration, including former President Chen Shui-
        bian;
Whereas most of these prosecutions were politically motivated, in an apparent 
        pattern of political score-settling;
Whereas the health of former President Chen, who is serving a 19-year prison 
        sentence, has deteriorated markedly in the past two years;
Whereas concerned foreign dignitaries and human rights activists from the United 
        States and Europe have visited former President Chen in jail since the 
        summer of 2012;
Whereas former President Chen has not been able to receive adequate medical 
        treatment in accordance with his wishes, such as selecting either 
        doctors or hospitals, and has not been able to have complete access to 
        his medical records; and
Whereas section 2(c) of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301(c)) declares 
        that ``[t]he preservation and enhancement of the human rights of all the 
        people of Taiwan are hereby reaffirmed as objectives of the United 
        States.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress urges the Government of Taiwan to grant former President 
Chen Shui-bian medical parole to ensure that he receives the highest 
level of medical attention, effective immediately.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
