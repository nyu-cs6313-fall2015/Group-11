                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress that Warren Weinstein should be 
                      returned home to his family.

Whereas Warren Weinstein was abducted in Pakistan in 2011 and is currently being 
        held captive by al-Qaeda;
Whereas Warren Weinstein is a former Peace Corps and former United States Agency 
        for International Development official;
Whereas Warren Weinstein is widely recognized as a scholar and humanitarian who 
        has spent his career working to improve the lives of men, women, and 
        children around the world; and
Whereas video released of Warren Weinstein by his captors confirms that he is in 
        poor health: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that the Administration should--
            (1) use all of the lawful tools at its disposal to bring 
        Warren Weinstein home to his family;
            (2) make the return of all United States citizens held 
        captive abroad, regardless of their different circumstances, a 
        top priority; and
            (3) keep Congress apprised of its actions to achieve these 
        goals as new information is available, or quarterly if no new 
        information is available.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
