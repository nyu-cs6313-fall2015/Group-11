        including freedom of speech, the press, assembly, religion, and due

        delivery of needed social services, provide effective health care 
        solutions to the Nepali people, and address the challenges of food 
        insecurity and climate change;
Whereas the United States and Nepal have long promoted open trade and investment 
        between the two countries, establishing a framework agreement for 
        bilateral talks to promote bilateral trade and investment;
Whereas the United States has long exported agricultural products, aircraft 
        parts, optic and medical instruments, low-value shipments, and machinery
