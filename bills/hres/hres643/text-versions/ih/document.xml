			 persistent perpetrator of economic espionage;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives investigated
			 the PRC’s major telecommunications companies and concluded in a bipartisan
			 report released October 2012 that Chinese businesses Huawei Technologies’

			 infrastructure could undermine core United States national security
			 interests;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in February 2013, the President issued the Administration’s Strategy on Mitigating the
			 Theft of United States Trade Secrets and stated, <quote>We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our
			 security and economy.</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Mandiant, a United States cybersecurity firm, reported in February 2013 that a
			 cyber-hacking group it labels as Advanced Persistent Threat 1 (APT1) is
			 based in the PRC and is likely government-sponsored;</text>

			 of the General Staff Department of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA)

			 originating in the PRC;</text>

			 whereas since that time, APT1 systematically stole hundreds of terabytes
			 of data from at least 141 companies in 20 major industries;</text>

			 industries in English-speaking countries and maintains an extensive

			 States Government, were targeted for intrusions, some of which were
			 attributable directly to the Government and military of the PRC;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Secretary of Defense asserted that these intrusions carried out by the PRC were focused
			 on exfiltrating information through computer network exploitation (CNE)
			 capabilities to support state-sponsored intelligence collection of United
			 States national defense programs;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Director of National Intelligence James Clapper reported to Congress in January 2014 that
			 China seeks to revise the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance
			 while continuing its expansive worldwide program of network exploitation
