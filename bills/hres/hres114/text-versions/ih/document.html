                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the Sabin Vaccine Institute on the 20th anniversary of its 
                               founding.

Whereas the Sabin Vaccine Institute was founded in honor of the late Dr. Albert 
        B. Sabin, a distinguished scientific figure in the history of medicine 
        and the developer of the oral live-virus polio vaccine, who died on 
        March 3, 1993;
Whereas for the past 20 years, the Sabin Vaccine Institute has demonstrated 
        noteworthy success in its mission to reduce the prevalence of neglected 
        tropical diseases (NTDs) by developing new vaccines, advocating for 
        increased use of existing vaccines, and expanding access to affordable 
        medicine for the world's poorest people;
Whereas the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Texas Children's Hospital Center for 
        Vaccine Development, operating in partnership with Baylor College of 
        Medicine and many collaborators worldwide, is dedicated to the creation 
        of vaccines to prevent NTDs;
Whereas the Sabin Vaccine Institute raises public visibility and mobilizes the 
        necessary funding in the pursuit of controlling and eliminating the 
        seven most common NTDs, including roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, 
        lymphatic filariais (elephantiasis), schistosomiasis (snail fever), 
        trachoma, and river blindness, which can be treated for approximately 50 
        cents per person per year with existing medicine;
Whereas the Sabin Vaccine Institute attempts to break the cycle of poverty 
        amongst adults and children by providing life-saving vaccinations that 
        lead to fuller, more productive lives;
Whereas the Sabin Vaccine Institute's mission is to ``reduce needless human 
        suffering from vaccine-preventable and neglected tropical diseases 
        (NTDs) by developing new vaccines, advocating for increased use of 
        existing vaccines, and promoting expanded access to affordable medical 
        treatments'';
Whereas the Sabin Vaccine Institute understands the importance that healthy 
        infants and adults have on family stabilization and productive 
        societies; and
Whereas the Sabin Vaccine Institute continues its work throughout impoverished 
        countries of the world to improve the future lives of nearly 
        2,000,000,000 people still plagued by NTDs and vaccine-preventable 
        diseases: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) applauds the Sabin Vaccine Institute on 20 years of 
        success;
            (2) supports the Sabin Vaccine Institute, Texas Children's 
        Hospital, and Baylor College of Medicine in their efforts to 
        reduce the prevalence of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by 
        developing new vaccines, advocating for increased use of 
        existing vaccines, and expanding access to affordable medicine 
        for the world's poorest people; and
            (3) encourages the leadership and staff of the Sabin 
        Vaccine Institute, Texas Children's Hospital, and Baylor 
        College of Medicine to continue their commendable work on 
        behalf of those who still suffer from NTDs and vaccine-
        preventable diseases.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
