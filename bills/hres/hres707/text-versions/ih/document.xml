	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas there is clear evidence of increasing incidents and expressions of anti-Semitism throughout
			 the world;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Department of State released this week the International Religious
			 Freedom Report for 2013 and noted in the Executive Summary, <quote>Throughout
			 Europe, the historical stain of anti-Semitism continued to be a fact of
			 life on Internet fora, in soccer stadiums, and through Nazi-like salutes,
			 leading many individuals who are Jewish to conceal their religious
			 identity.</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas anti-Semitic acts committed and recorded in 2014 around the world, including countries in
			 the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, and North America, include
			 incidents of murder at Jewish sites, violent attacks and death threats
			 against Jews, as well as gun violence, arson, graffiti, anti-Semitic
			 cartoons, and other property desecration at Jewish places of worship and
			 communal activity;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a survey by the Anti-Defamation League of attitudes towards Jews in more than 100 countries
			 around the world, released in May 2014 found that over a quarter of the
			 people surveyed (26 percent) hold anti-Semitic views, a stunning indicator
			 of the stubborn resilience of anti-Semitic beliefs, even in countries
			 where no Jews reside;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas anti-Semitic attitudes in the Middle East and North Africa (74 percent) far surpass those
			 in any other region;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the finding that 70 percent of those around the world who harbor anti-Semitic attitudes
			 have never met a Jew shows how deeply embedded stereotypes of Jews that
			 developed over centuries are in the consciousness of many countries and
			 societies;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Anti-Defamation League survey also found that a majority of people surveyed overall
			 have either not heard of the Holocaust or do not believe it happened as
			 has been documented by factual accounts and recorded by history;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas this month Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban erected a monument commemorating the Nazi
			 Occupation of Hungary that white washes the Hungarian government’s role in
			 deporting over 400,000 Jews, most of whom died in Auschwitz;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas President Barack Obama said in his remarks at the USC Shoah Foundation Dinner on May 7,
			 2014, <quote>… if the memories of the Shoah survivors teach us anything, it is
			 that silence is evil’s greatest co-conspirator. And it’s up to us—each
			 of us, every one of us—to forcefully condemn any denial of the
			 Holocaust. It’s up to us to combat not only anti-Semitism, but racism and
			 bigotry and intolerance in all their forms, here and around the world.
			 It’s up to us to speak out against rhetoric that threatens the existence
			 of a Jewish homeland and to sustain America’s unshakeable commitment to
			 Israel’s security</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in 2004, Congress passed the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act, which established an Office
			 to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, headed by a Special Envoy to Monitor
			 and Combat Anti-Semitism;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government has consistently supported efforts to address the rise in
			 anti-Semitism through its bilateral relationships and through engagement
			 in international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), the
			 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the
			 Organization of American States (OAS);</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas during Israel’s July 2014 Operation Protective Edge aiming to stem the rocket fire and
			 terrorist infiltrations by Hamas, Jews and Jewish institutions and
			 property have been attacked in Europe and elsewhere, including attempts to
			 invade a synagogue in Paris, fire-bombings of synagogues in France and
			 Germany, assaults on Jewish individuals, and swastikas spray-painted in a
			 heavily Jewish area of London and also in Rome’s historic Jewish quarter;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas anti-Semitic imagery and comparisons of Jews and Israel to Nazis have been on display at
			 demonstrations against Israel’s actions in Gaza around the United States,
			 Europe, the Middle East and Latin America, including—</text>
			<paragraph id="HC0D0E56157134201AFA8B5F5993803D8"><enum>(1)</enum><text>placards held at many demonstrations across the globe comparing Israeli leaders to Nazis, accusing
			 Israel of carrying out a <quote>Holocaust</quote> against Palestinians, and equating
			 the Jewish Star of David with the Nazi swastika, and</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H52653586025E44FC8CE31B835CE72F34"><enum>(2)</enum><text>demonstrations that have included chants of <quote>Death to Jews</quote>, <quote>Death to Israel</quote>, or expressions of
			 support for suicide terrorism against Israeli or Jewish civilians;</text>
			</paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s continued anti-Israel incitement, including
			 stating that Israel’s defense against Hamas rocket fire is <quote>barbarism that surpasses Hitler</quote>, sparks unwarranted anger towards Jews and endangers the Turkish Jewish community and Jews around
			 the world;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Governments in France, Germany, and Italy, the three countries where the majority of
			 incidents have occurred, have strongly condemned anti-Semitism as
			 unacceptable in European society, including French President Hollande and
			 Prime Minister Valls, German Chancellor Merkel, and the foreign ministers
			 of France, Germany, and Italy collectively, have all made clear statements
			 that such attacks on their Jewish communities are intolerable, and they
			 have matched those words with strong law enforcement;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas some civil society leaders have set strong examples, including the condemnation by the
			 Union of Mosques of France, on behalf of their 500 mosques, called the
			 attacks <quote>morally unjust and unacceptable</quote>, and stated, <quote>nothing can justify any act that could harm our Jewish compatriots, their
			 institutions or their places of worship</quote> and, in Germany, the largest
			 circulation paper, Bild, featured statements against anti-Semitism from
			 politicians, business leaders, civic leaders, media personalities and
			 celebrities with <quote>Never Again Jew Hatred</quote> on the front page; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Congress supports freedom of expression and the right to criticize any government or its
			 policy and has played an essential role in shining a spotlight on the
			 resurgence of anti-Semitism worldwide: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
