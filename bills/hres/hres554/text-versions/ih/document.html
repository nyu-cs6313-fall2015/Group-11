                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the alarming mortality rate of African-American women with 
                             breast cancer.

Whereas serious disparities persist in United States health care today;
Whereas life-saving progress has been made in breast cancer treatment over the 
        last two decades, but we have not seen the same progress in the 
        treatment of African-American breast cancer patients;
Whereas African-American women have a 41 percent higher breast cancer mortality 
        rate than white women in the United States;
Whereas this disparity results in 1,700 additional deaths each year;
Whereas in Los Angeles, a black breast cancer patient is about 70 percent more 
        likely to die from the disease than a white breast cancer patient is 
        likely to die from the disease;
Whereas African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed with later stage 
        breast cancer; and
Whereas African-American women are less likely to be screened for breast cancer 
        and less likely to receive the medical treatment they need to fight 
        breast cancer: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the disparity in treatment rates of African-
        American breast cancer patients;
            (2) affirms that this disparity is unacceptable and should 
        be addressed;
            (3) calls for immediate action to be taken to raise 
        awareness of breast cancer screening for all women in the 
        United States; and
            (4) calls for immediate action to be taken to expand access 
        to treatment for all breast cancer patients regardless of race.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
