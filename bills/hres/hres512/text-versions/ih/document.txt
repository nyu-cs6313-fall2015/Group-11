                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing linemen, the profession of linemen, the contributions of 
  these brave men and women who protect public safety, and expressing 
  support for the designation of March 31, 2014, as National Lineman 
                           Appreciation Day.

Whereas the profession of linemen is steeped in personal, family, and 
        professional tradition;
Whereas linemen are often first responders during storms and other catastrophic 
        events, working to make the scene safe for other public safety heroes;
Whereas linemen must work high atop powerlines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, 
        to keep electricity flowing;
Whereas linemen play a vital role in the Nation's economy by maintaining and 
        growing the energy infrastructure of the United States;
Whereas linemen must often work under dangerous conditions separated from their 
        families to keep schools and businesses open;
Whereas linemen put their lives on the line every day with little recognition 
        from the community regarding the danger of their work; and
Whereas March 31, 2014, would be an appropriate date to designate as National 
        Lineman Appreciation Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the efforts of linemen in keeping the power 
        on and protecting public safety; and
            (2) supports the designation of National Lineman 
        Appreciation Day.
                                 <all>
