Impeaching Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General of the United States, 
                   for high crimes and misdemeanors.

    Resolved, That Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General of the United 
States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors, and that the 
following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the Senate:
     Articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in the name of itself and all of the 
people of the United States of America, against Eric H. Holder, Jr., 
Attorney General of the United States, in maintenance and support of 
its impeachment against him for high crimes and misdemeanors.

                               article i

    Eric H. Holder, Jr., while Attorney General of the United States, 
engaged in a pattern of conduct incompatible with the trust and 
confidence placed in him in that position by refusing to comply with a 
subpoena issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform on October 12, 2011, in connection with a legitimate 
Congressional investigation into Operation Fast and Furious by the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms that put thousands of 
illegally purchased weapons into the hands of cartel leaders, 
ultimately resulting in the death of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian 
Terry on December 14, 2010.
    Wherefore, Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General of the United 
States, is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed 
from office and disqualified to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United States.

                               article ii

    Eric H. Holder, Jr., while Attorney General of the United States, 
and responsible for enforcing the laws of the United States regardless 
of personal bias, failed to enforce multiple laws, including the 
Defense of Marriage Act, the Controlled Substances Act, and the Anti-
Drug Abuse Act of 1986.
    Wherefore, Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General of the United 
States, is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed 
from office and disqualified to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United States.

                              article iii

    Eric H. Holder, Jr., while Attorney General of the United States, 
has failed his oath of office by refusing to prosecute individuals 
involved in the Internal Revenue Service scandal of unauthorized 
disclosure of tax records belonging to political donors.
    Wherefore, Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General of the United 
States, is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed 
from office and disqualified to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United States.

                               article iv

    Eric H. Holder, Jr., while Attorney General of the United States, 
testified under oath before Congress on May 15, 2013, that he was 
neither involved in nor had heard of a potential prosecution of the 
press. However three days later, the Department of Justice released 
documents naming journalist James Rosen as a co-conspirator in an 
alleged violation of the Espionage Act. Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney 
General of the United States, confirmed to the Committee on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives in a letter dated June 19, 
2013, that he approved of a search warrant on James Rosen.
    Wherefore, Eric H. Holder, Jr., Attorney General of the United 
States, is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed 
from office and disqualified to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United States.
