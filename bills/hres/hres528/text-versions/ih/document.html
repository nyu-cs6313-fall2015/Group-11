                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of March 2014 as ``National Multiple 
                       Myeloma Awareness Month''.

Whereas multiple myeloma (or myeloma) is a cancer of plasma cells in the bone 
        marrow and is called ``multiple'' because it can occur at various sites 
        in the body;
Whereas multiple myeloma causes a variety of adverse health effects, including a 
        weakened immune system, anemia, kidney damage, and bone deterioration;
Whereas multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer worldwide;
Whereas multiple myeloma currently affects more than 100,000 people in the 
        United States, with about 22,350 new cases diagnosed and 10,710 deaths 
        from the disease in 2013 according to the National Cancer Institute's 
        Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program;
Whereas once predominately found among those 65 and over, where it continues to 
        be most frequently diagnosed, multiple myeloma is increasingly being 
        identified in younger age individuals including those in their 30s, 40s, 
        and 50s;
Whereas multiple myeloma is almost twice as likely to occur among African-
        Americans and is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths among 
        African-Americans, with scientific understanding of the disparity 
        remaining unknown;
Whereas the cause of multiple myeloma is not known, with robust research being 
        performed in the United States and internationally into potential 
        genetic, environmental, and other risk factors;
Whereas recent years have seen the development of new drugs and treatments that 
        have improved life expectancies and significantly enhanced the quality 
        of life for patients;
Whereas additional new drugs and therapies are in the research phase, with 
        patient enrollment in clinical trials playing an important role in 
        determining safe and effective treatments;
Whereas understanding and treatment of multiple myeloma has been greatly 
        furthered by the role of advocacy initiatives promoting awareness, 
        education, research, peer review, and collaboration and such efforts are 
        to be highly commended;
Whereas greater awareness of multiple myeloma on the part of clinicians and the 
        general public can lead to earlier detection and treatment, improving 
        health outcomes and bringing comfort to patients and their families; and
Whereas March 2014 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National 
        Multiple Myeloma Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``National Multiple Myeloma Awareness Month'' to 
increase public knowledge of this disease and advance the vision of 
finding a cure for multiple myeloma.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
