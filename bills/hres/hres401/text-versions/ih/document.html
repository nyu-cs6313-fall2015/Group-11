                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of the third Tuesday of November as 
                    ``National Entrepreneurs Day''.

Whereas since our Nation's beginning, innovation, creativity, industriousness, 
        and entrepreneurship have formed the economic fiber of the United 
        States;
Whereas entrepreneurs' willingness to evaluate risk has resulted in unparalleled 
        contributions to this country's growth and development;
Whereas entrepreneurship is the stimulus for strengthening the economy, 
        advancing innovation, improving productivity, and creating new jobs;
Whereas research conveys that innovation has been responsible for approximately 
        two-thirds of our country's economic growth since World War II;
Whereas more than half-a-million new businesses are created in the United States 
        every month and small business openings have accounted for 40 percent of 
        new jobs in the last two decades;
Whereas despite economic instability, 56 percent of adults were confident that 
        they could start a business and 82 percent of entrepreneurs in 2012 used 
        their own savings for startup cash, indicating that the American 
        entrepreneurial spirit remains strong;
Whereas collaboration and cooperation amidst a broad coalition of organizations, 
        including nonprofit entrepreneurial incubators, angel investors, venture 
        capitalists, crowd-funding initiatives, and other early-stage investors, 
        catalyze entrepreneurial ventures;
Whereas entrepreneurial literacy skills serve as one of the 21st-century content 
        areas critical to success in communities and workplaces;
Whereas more than 70 percent of young Americans envision starting a business or 
        doing something entrepreneurial as adults;
Whereas positive outcomes for youth who participate in entrepreneurship 
        education programs include improved academic performance, increased 
        critical thinking skills, and heightened occupational aspirations;
Whereas to maintain our position as a world economic leader, the government, 
        entrepreneurs, universities, and small and large businesses of this 
        country must be united in a comprehensive effort to welcome and 
        cultivate entrepreneurial savvy;
Whereas entrepreneurship is America's best offense for economic progress and its 
        finest defense against the status quo; and
Whereas the third Tuesday of November would be an appropriate date to designate 
        as ``National Entrepreneurs Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Entrepreneurs 
        Day'';
            (2) recognizes the considerable contributions of 
        entrepreneurs to the United States of America; and
            (3) honors those entrepreneurs who ignite innovation and 
        inspire the next generation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
