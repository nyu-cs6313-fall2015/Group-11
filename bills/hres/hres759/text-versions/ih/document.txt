 Recognizing Survivors Victory Day to celebrate and honor the victims 
                        and survivors of trauma.

Whereas, on November 19, 2002, Jessica Huber from Leander, Texas, was nearly 
        killed after her mother, while under the influence of prescription pain 
        killers, narcotics, and marijuana, ran a red light and crashed;
Whereas Jessica, as a result of her injuries, underwent multiple blood 
        transfusions and surgeries;
Whereas, despite the extraordinary odds against her survival, Jessica is living 
        a happy, healthy, and productive life;
Whereas Jessica's story is a poignant reminder of the thousands who have been 
        victims and survivors of trauma;
Whereas stories of survivors of trauma remind us all of the indomitable nature 
        of the human spirit and our basic desire to persevere in the face of 
        adversity; and
Whereas, in honor of Jessica Huber, November 19 is recognized as Survivors 
        Victory Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes Survivors 
Victory Day to celebrate and honor the victims and survivors of trauma.
