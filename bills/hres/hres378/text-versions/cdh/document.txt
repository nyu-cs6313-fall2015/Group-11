                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding certain 
    provisions of the Senate amendment to H.R. 2642 relating to the 
Secretary of Agriculture's administration of tariff-rate quotas for raw 
                           and refined sugar.

    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the managers on the part of the House of the conference on the 
disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment to the 
Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 2642 (an Act to provide for the 
reform and continuation of agricultural and other programs of the 
Department of Agriculture and other programs of the Department of 
Agriculture through fiscal year 2018, and for other purposes) should 
advance provisions to repeal the Administration of Tariff Rate Quotas 
language as added by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, 
and thus restore the Secretary of Agriculture's authority to manage 
supplies of sugar throughout the marketing year to meet domestic demand 
at reasonable prices.
