                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President 
  should suspend the delivery of F-16 fighter aircraft, M1 tanks, and 
other defense articles and defense services to the Government of Egypt.

Whereas the shipment of F-16 fighter aircraft to Egypt is scheduled for 
        completed delivery by the end of 2013;
Whereas the agreement to provide these military aircraft to Egypt originated in 
        2009 when the proposal was brought to Congress for purchase and delivery 
        of these aircraft through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) Program;
Whereas these aircraft were intended for receipt by the Government of Egypt 
        under the leadership of President Hosni Mubarak;
Whereas in the 3 years it has taken for the procurement of these aircraft, Egypt 
        has undergone significant changes in their government, including a 
        revolution and the installment of a new leader, Mohamed Morsi, a former 
        leader of the Muslim Brotherhood;
Whereas recent and previous statements by President Morsi indicate a clear 
        hostility towards non-Muslims in Egypt as well as towards the United 
        States and its allies--particularly Israel;
Whereas the instability of the region is also evident from the continued anti-
        government protests that have resulted in at least 50 deaths and 
        hundreds of injuries;
Whereas President Morsi granted emergency powers to the Egyptian military to 
        arrest Egyptian civilians and serve as a police force in the country;
Whereas Congress recognizes and understands the important and delicate nature of 
        the relationship the United States maintains with Egypt, but, given the 
        facts, we believe that United States military support of this newly 
        established government must become conditional;
Whereas referring to Egypt in September 2012, President Obama stated: ``I don't 
        think that we would consider them an ally.''; and
Whereas the Obama Administration has deemed inadequate President Morsi's apology 
        for his anti-Semitic comments: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the President should suspend the delivery of F-16 fighter aircraft, M1 
tanks, and other defense articles and defense services listed in 
Category VI, VII, or VIII of the United States Munitions List to the 
Government of Egypt until the President determines and certifies to 
Congress that the Government of Egypt--
            (1) is politically stable as evidenced by a lack of civil 
        unrest and the termination of use of military force against 
        Egyptian citizens;
            (2) is a full partner in its alliance with the United 
        States; and
            (3) demonstrates respect for Israel and its people.
                                 <all>
