 Recognizing the 200th anniversary of the Battles at the River Raisin

Whereas from January 18 to January 22, 1813, the military forces of the United 
        States and Great Britain engaged in the Battles of Frenchtown, which 
        have come to be commonly referred to as the Battles of River Raisin;
Whereas the battles on the north bank of the River Raisin were some of the 
        largest engagements of the War of 1812, and the largest battle ever to 
        be fought on Michigan soil;
Whereas the conflicts were some of the bloodiest engagements during the War of 
        1812;
Whereas of the 934 members of the United States Armed Forces who fought here, 
        only 33 escaped death or capture;
Whereas the Battles of the River Raisin had a significant effect on the campaign 
        for the Great Lakes and inspired one of the great rallying cries of the 
        War of 1812, ``Remember the Raisin!'';
Whereas each January on the anniversary of the battle, a memorial service is 
        held commemorating the service of the Citizens of the United States, the 
        United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Native Americans who fought at the 
        Battle of River Raisin;
Whereas the River Raisin Battlefield Site was established as a Michigan State 
        Historic Site on February 18, 1956, and was placed on the National 
        Register of Historic Places on December 10, 1982;
Whereas since 1990 the Monroe County Historical Commission and the Monroe County 
        Historical Society have managed the Monroe River Raisin Battlefield 
        Visitor Center, a source of community pride and a resource for 
        information about the Battle of River Raisin;
Whereas the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-11) 
        authorized the establishment of the River Raisin National Battlefield 
        Park at Monroe, Michigan;
Whereas, on October 22, 2010, the River Raisin National Battlefield Park was 
        established as the 393rd unit of the United States National Park Service 
        and is the only National Battlefield Park representing the War of 1812; 
        and
Whereas the 200th anniversary of the Battles of the River Raisin are January 18 
        to January 22, 2013: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--

        River Raisin;
            (2) pays tribute to the members of the United States Armed 
        Forces who died at River Raisin;
            (3) recognizes the work of the River Raisin Battlefield 
        Visitor Center in Monroe, Michigan, a cooperative effort of the 
        Monroe County Historical Commission, Monroe County Historical 
        Society, National Park Service and the City of Monroe in 
        preserving and maintaining this battlefield and the legacy of 
        those who fought for future generations; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to visit the 
        River Raisin National Battlefield Park on the occasion of this 
        bicentennial anniversary.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
