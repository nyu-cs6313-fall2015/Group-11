                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commending the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs for their 
joint campaign to raise awareness during September, Suicide Prevention 
   Month, to reduce suicide among members of the United States Armed 
                          Forces and veterans.

Whereas suicide is a leading noncombat cause of death among members of the 
        United States Armed Forces;
Whereas on average, 22 veterans are lost to suicide in the United States each 
        day;
Whereas more than 38,000 people in the United States take their lives each year, 
        20 percent of whom are veterans;
Whereas the Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act (Public Law 110-110; 121 Stat. 
        1031) was enacted in 2007 to establish a comprehensive program for 
        suicide prevention among veterans;
Whereas the Veterans Crisis Line, which was established under the Joshua Omvig 
        Suicide Prevention Act, has received more than 890,000 telephone calls 
        and facilitated more than 30,000 life-saving rescues;
Whereas many suicides are preventable, and 90 percent of individuals who die by 
        suicide have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder at the time of death;
Whereas September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month; and
Whereas in September 2014, the Department of Defense and the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs launched the joint public awareness campaign ``The 
        Power of 1'' to draw attention to the mental health services and suicide 
        prevention programs available to members of the United States Armed 
        Forces and veterans, focusing on everyday actions that can save lives: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the Department of Defense and the Department 
        of Veterans Affairs for raising awareness during Suicide 
        Prevention Month of the life-saving resources available to 
        those who have served, or are currently serving, in uniform; 
        and
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Suicide 
        Prevention Awareness Month, ``The Power of 1'' campaign, and 
        efforts to improve outreach to individuals at risk for suicide, 
        especially those addressed to veterans and members of the 
        United States Armed Forces.
                                 <all>
