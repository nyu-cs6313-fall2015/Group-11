                               RESOLUTION


 
  Honoring Jacoby Dickens, the successful, community-oriented African-
      American financier and philanthropist in Chicago, Illinois.

Whereas Jacoby Dickens has become a prominent representation of the American 
        Dream through his remarkable growth from humble beginnings in Florida to 
        renowned financier of Seaway Bank & Trust Co.;
Whereas Dickens has distinguished himself as much for his philanthropic efforts 
        as for his entrepreneurial successes, constantly investing into the 
        African-American community;
Whereas Jacoby D. Dickens was born in Panama City, Florida, on June 19, 1931, 
        one of six children, in a low-income household and went on to complete 
        his high school education at Wendell Phillips High School in the South 
        Side of Chicago;
Whereas Mr. Dickens began saving money while working as a building engineer and 
        used his savings to invest in real estate;
Whereas Mr. Dickens used the returns of his successful investments in real 
        estate to invest in multiple bowling alleys across Chicago, and gained 
        exposure as a financial up-and-comer;
Whereas Mr. Dickens became chairman of Seaway Bank & Co. in 1983, just 4 years 
        after joining their board;
Whereas Seaway was one of very few banks willing to provide loans in tough 
        neighborhoods in the South Side of Chicago, primarily due to the Mr. 
        Dickens' model of success;
Whereas Mr. Dickens built a $500,000,000 organization while focusing on 
        dedicating his services to African-Americans in lower income 
        communities, at a time when many were unwilling to take such risks;
Whereas countless businesses, families, and communities at large were impacted 
        by Mr. Dickens' trust in people;
Whereas Mr. Dickens believed that people are equal and deserve the opportunity 
        to better themselves; and
Whereas Seaway & Co. was originally only one of few banks in Chicago owned by 
        African-Americans, but is now one of the largest and most successful 
        banks in the city: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors Jacoby Dickens, the successful, community-
        oriented African-American financier and philanthropist in 
        Chicago, Illinois, for his dedication to increasing equity 
        amongst lower income African-Americans;
            (2) joins Jacoby Dickens and other philanthropic 
        entrepreneurs in promoting equal access to financial betterment 
        for underprivileged communities; and
            (3) believes that the fruit of thoughtful risk taking is 
        the backbone of success in the United States; and
            (4) encourages each individual's pursuit of life, liberty, 
        and happiness.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
