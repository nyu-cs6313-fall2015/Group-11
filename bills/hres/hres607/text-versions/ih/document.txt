                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the importance of the historic 2014 Indian Elections.

Whereas India is the world's largest democracy, with more than 1.2 billion 
        people living in 29 states and 7 union territories;
Whereas the United States established diplomatic relations with India on 
        November 1, 1946, and officially recognized India as an independent 
        state on August 15, 1947;
Whereas the United States-India relationship is rooted in common values, 
        including democracy, respect for ethnic and religious diversity, and the 
        rule of law and is further strengthened by strong people-to-people ties;
Whereas the United States supports the fundamental democratic rights guaranteed 
        in the Constitution of India;
Whereas the United States recognizes the critical role India plays in 
        maintaining regional and global stability;
Whereas Indian foreign direct investment in the United States economy has 
        surpassed $5 billion, creating and supporting thousands of United States 
        jobs;
Whereas United States agricultural, manufacturing, defense and energy industries 
        are eager to engage with India for mutual growth opportunities;
Whereas with some 550 million people voting, India's recent elections marked the 
        largest democratic exercise in the world;
Whereas all parties participating in India's polls carried out a hard-fought, 
        free and fair election;
Whereas the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prevailed in the election, securing 282 
        out of 543 total seats of the Lok Sabha (India's lower house of 
        Parliament);
Whereas the new Indian government's commitment to efficient governance, respect 
        for the rule of law, and strong alliances with strategic partners like 
        the United States will benefit India and the United States-India 
        partnership;
Whereas the United States has an opportunity to build on the U.S.-India 
        strategic partnership that has been cultivated over the course of the 
        past decades with both the Congress Party and BJP-led governments; and
Whereas the President of the United States, Barack Obama, has invited Prime 
        Minister Modi to visit the United States and committed to work with the 
        new government to ``fulfill the extraordinary promise of the United 
        States-India strategic partnership'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates the people of India on holding the 
        largest democratic exercise in the history of the world;
            (2) recognizes that both opposition and winning party 
        members participated in a hard-fought election;
            (3) commits to working with the new Narendra Modi-led 
        Indian Government to advance shared values and interests; and
            (4) will seek to further strengthen our strategic 
        partnership with India, including in the defense, trade, and 
        security arenas.
                                 <all>
