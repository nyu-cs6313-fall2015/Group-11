			 School, a boarding school located in the northeastern province of Borno in
			 the Federal Republic of Nigeria;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, all public secondary schools in Borno state were closed in March 2014 because of
			 increasing attacks in the past year that have killed hundreds of students,
			 but the young women at the Government Girls Secondary School were recalled
			 to take their final exams;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, Boko Haram burned down several buildings before opening fire on soldiers and police who

			 students into trucks;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to local officials in Borno state, 53 students were able to flee their captors,
			 and the rest remain abducted;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, there are reports that the abducted girls have been sold as brides to Islamist militants
			 for the equivalent of $12 each;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, the group popularly known as <quote>Boko Haram</quote>, which loosely translates from the Hausa language to <quote>Western education is sin</quote>, is known to oppose the education of girls;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on April 14, 2014, hours before the kidnapping in Borno state, and on May 2, 2014, Boko
			 Haram bombed bus stations in Abuja, Nigeria, killing at least 94 people
			 and wounding over 160, making it the deadliest set of attacks ever in
			 Nigeria’s capital;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, Boko Haram has kidnapped girls in the past to use as cooks and sex slaves, and has claimed

			 age from 12 to 15, from a village in northeast Nigeria;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, the Department of State designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in
			 November 2013, recognizing the threat posed by the group’s large-scale and
			 indiscriminate attacks against civilians, including women and children;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, reports estimate that more than 500 students and 100 teachers have been killed by Boko
			 Haram and have destroyed roughly 500 schools in northern Nigeria, leaving
			 more than 15,000 students without access to education;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, Boko Haram has targeted schools, mosques, churches, villages, and agricultural centers, as
			 well as government facilities, in an armed campaign to create an Islamic
			 state in northern Nigeria, prompting the President of Nigeria to declare a
			 state of emergency in three of the country’s northeastern states in May
			 2013;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, human rights groups have indicated that the Nigerian state security forces should improve
			 efforts to protect civilians during offensive operations against Boko
			 Haram;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to nongovernmental organizations,  more than 1,500 people have been killed in
			 attacks by Boko Haram or reprisals by Nigerian security forces this year
			 alone, and that almost 4,000 people have been killed in Boko Haram attacks
			 since 2011;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, the enrollment, retention, and completion of education for girls in Nigeria remains a
			 major challenge;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to the United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), some 4,700,000
			 children of primary school age are still not in school in Nigeria, with
			 attendance rates lowest in the north;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, studies have found that school children in Nigeria, particularly those in the northern
			 provinces, are at a disadvantage in their education, with 37 percent of
			 primary-age girls in the rural northeast not attending school, and 30
			 percent of boys not attending school; and</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, women and girls must be allowed to go to school without fear of violence and unjust
			 treatment so that they can take their rightful place as equal citizens of
			 and contributors to society: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body id="HB205125491F24612A3D39ED93896BC1A" style="OLC"><section display-inline="yes-display-inline" id="idF72A7EB6FE84498AABE086105F2CA9BD" section-type="undesignated-section"><enum></enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">That the House of Representatives—</text>
