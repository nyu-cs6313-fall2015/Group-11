<preamble> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the United States has been strongly committed to the sovereignty, democratic development, and prosperity of Ukraine since it secured its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas on January 29, 2014, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives agreed to House Resolution 447, supporting the democratic and European aspirations of the people of Ukraine and their right to choose their own future free of intimidation and fear, which resolution was agreed to by the House of Representatives on February 10, 2014;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the Ukrainian people have the right to freely determine their future, including their country’s relationship with other countries and international organizations, without interference, intimidation, or coercion by other countries;</text> </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas closer relations with Europe hold out the prospect of a more stable and prosperous Ukraine, which would be of benefit to all countries, including Russia;</text> </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the military intervention by the Russian Federation in Crimea is a violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity;</text> </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas this military intervention is a violation of international law, including the Russian Federation’s obligations under the United Nations Charter;</text> </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas this military intervention is a violation of the Russian Federation’s obligations under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, in which it pledged to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine;</text> </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas by its military intervention in Ukraine, the Russian Federation has violated the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act Declaration of Principles Regarding Relations Between Participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe;</text> </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation’s military intervention in Crimea represents a reckless escalation of its long-standing efforts to pressure Ukraine through political, diplomatic, and economic means to reduce its ties to Europe and the West and force it into a closer association with Russia, including through the establishment of a Eurasian Union;</text> </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation has used and is continuing to use coercive economic measures, including the manipulation of energy prices and supplies, and trade restrictions to place political pressure on Ukraine and other countries in the region;</text> </whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Ukraine has exercised extraordinary restraint to date in response to the use of force against it on its territory;</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the instability in Ukraine has forced 230 Peace Corps volunteers to leave Ukraine; and</text></whereas> 
<whereas><text>Whereas the immediate deployment of international monitors from either the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe or the United Nations to Crimea and in other Ukrainian regions would provide transparency and objective reporting regarding threats of violence and military activity, and regarding civil and political rights, and also enhance the security of the Ukrainian people in all regions: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
