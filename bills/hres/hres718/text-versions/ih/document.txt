                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           September 9, 2014

    Mr. Schweikert (for himself, Mr. Rohrabacher, and Ms. Gabbard) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
                           on Foreign Affairs

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Calling on the Department of Defense to expedite the delivery of all 
  necessary military equipment, weapons, ammunition, and other needed 
 materials to the Kurdish Peshmerga forces to successfully combat and 
          defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS).

Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has committed acts of 
        terrorism, crimes against humanity and continues to threaten the 
        security and stability of the Middle East;
Whereas the Kurdish Peshmerga forces have fought bravely against ISIS to secure 
        Iraqi Army bases that contained United States-made weapons and equipment 
        and to protect critical infrastructure vulnerable to invasion by ISIS;
Whereas successful battles against Iraqi security forces have provided ISIS with 
        advanced weapons systems and armored vehicles, severely limiting the 
        Kurdish Peshmerga forces' capabilities against ISIS;
Whereas the strain of combat against ISIS has depleted the Kurdish Peshmerga 
        forces' weapons caches, leaving them lightly armed and inadequately 
        equipped to counter the better-equipped ISIS force;
Whereas the Kurdish Peshmerga forces are a longtime ally of the United States 
        and are perfectly positioned to effectively fight against ISIS and have 
        recently asked for material and non-material support;
Whereas Department of Defense spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby, confirmed that 
        the Department of Defense knows what the Kurdish Peshmerga forces need 
        to combat ISIS;
Whereas Albania, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Italy, France, Germany, and the 
        United Kingdom have committed to supplying arms to the Kurdish Peshmerga 
        forces; and
Whereas the United States, through the Department of Defense, have provided no 
        meaningful military equipment, weapons, ammunition or other needed 
        materials to the Kurdish Peshmerga forces: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives calls on the Department 
of Defense to expedite the direct delivery of all necessary military 
equipment, weapons, ammunition, and other needed materials to the 
Kurdish Peshmerga forces to successfully combat and defeat ISIS.
                                 <all>
