                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for a whole child approach to education and 
 recognizing the role of parents, educators, and community members in 
    providing a whole child approach to education for each student.

Whereas each student deserves to be challenged academically, exposed to a 
        comprehensive education that promotes critical thinking and creativity, 
        and prepared for higher education, meaningful employment in our global 
        economy, and lifelong success;
Whereas each student deserves to be supported by qualified, caring adults and 
        receive access to personalized learning;
Whereas each student deserves to learn about and practice a healthy lifestyle;
Whereas each student deserves to learn in an environment that is physically and 
        emotionally safe;
Whereas each student deserves to be actively engaged in learning and connected 
        to the school and broader community;
Whereas the consequences of not ensuring that our young people are challenged, 
        supported, healthy, safe, and engaged are clear;
Whereas the average graduation rate for United States students rose to 80 
        percent in 2012, but the graduation rate the same year for students with 
        disabilities was only 61 percent, the rate for English language learners 
        was 59 percent, and the rate for economically disadvantaged students was 
        71 percent;
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most United 
        States youth do not get the recommended amount of daily physical 
        activity, and students who lack the food and resources for healthy 
        living are less likely to be attentive in school and have higher 
        absenteeism, which can lead to lower academic performance;
Whereas students who feel unsafe in school are more prone to truancy and 
        disruptive behaviors, have lower grades, and may drop out of school 
        entirely, and, according to the Indicators of School Crime and Safety 
        report of 2012, 74 percent of public schools reported one or more 
        violent incidents of crime from 2009-2010, and 32 percent of middle and 
        high school students reported being bullied during the 2007 school year; 
        and
Whereas the Partnership for 21st Century Skills reports that future employees 
        must know how to communicate, collaborate, be creative, and think 
        critically, and, according to the Alliance for Excellent Education, 
        unless graduation rates improve, nearly 12 million students will likely 
        drop out over the next decade, resulting in a loss to the national 
        economy of $1.5 trillion: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses support for a whole child approach to 
        education;
            (2) recognizes the benefit of ensuring students are 
        challenged, supported, healthy, safe, and engaged;
            (3) encourages parents, educators, and community members to 
        support a whole child approach to education for each student; 
        and
            (4) encourages the Federal Government to identify 
        opportunities among Federal agencies to coordinate the 
        education, health, and social service sectors serving youth in 
        the United States.
