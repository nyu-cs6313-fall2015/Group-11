                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of October as National Domestic 
   Violence Awareness Month and expressing the sense of the House of 
  Representatives that Congress should continue to raise awareness of 
domestic violence and its devastating effects on individuals, families, 
and communities, and support programs designed to end domestic violence 
                         in the United States.

Whereas domestic violence affects people of all ages as well as racial, ethnic, 
        gender, economic, and religious backgrounds;
Whereas females are disproportionately victims as one in four women will 
        experience domestic violence at some point in her life;
Whereas on average, more than three women are murdered by their husbands or 
        boyfriends in the United States every day;
Whereas in 2007, 1,640 women were murdered by an intimate partner, constituting 
        70 percent of all intimate partner homicides that year;
Whereas women ages 16 to 24 experience the highest rates, per capita, of 
        intimate partner violence;
Whereas 1 out of 3 Native American women will be raped and 6 out of 10 will be 
        physically assaulted in their lifetimes;
Whereas the cost of intimate partner violence exceeds $5,800,000,000 each year, 
        $4,100,000 of which is for direct medical and mental health care 
        services;
Whereas one-quarter to one-half of domestic violence victims report that they 
        have lost a job due, at least in part, to domestic violence;
Whereas some landlords deny housing to victims of domestic violence who have 
        protection orders or evict victims of domestic violence for seeking help 
        after a domestic violence incident, such as by calling 911, or who have 
        other indications that they are domestic violence victims;
Whereas 92 percent of homeless women experience severe physical or sexual abuse 
        at some point in their lifetimes;
Whereas approximately 40 to 60 percent of men who abuse women also abuse 
        children;
Whereas at least 10,000,000 children are exposed to domestic violence each year;
Whereas children exposed to domestic violence are more likely to attempt 
        suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, and become a 
        victim of human trafficking;
Whereas one large study found that men exposed to physical abuse, sexual abuse, 
        and adult domestic violence as children were almost four times more 
        likely than other men to have perpetrated domestic violence as adults;
Whereas nearly 1,500,000 high school students nationwide experienced physical 
        abuse from a dating partner;
Whereas 13 percent of teenage girls who have been in a relationship report being 
        hit or hurt by their partners and one in four teenage girls has been in 
        a relationship in which she was pressured by her partner into performing 
        sexual acts;
Whereas adolescent girls who reported dating violence were 60 percent more 
        likely to report one or more suicide attempts in the past year;
Whereas there is a need for middle schools, secondary schools, and post-
        secondary schools to educate students about the issues of domestic 
        violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking;
Whereas a recently released multi-State study shows that the Nation's domestic 
        violence shelters are addressing victims' urgent and long-term needs and 
        are helping victims protect themselves and their children;
Whereas a 2012 National Census Survey reported that 64,324 domestic violence 
        victims were served by domestic violence shelters and programs around 
        the Nation in a single day;
Whereas an additional 10,401 people requested help that day, but due to lack of 
        resources, they were unable to be served;
Whereas there is a need to increase funding for programs aimed at intervening 
        and preventing domestic violence in the United States;
Whereas domestic shelters and programs experience increased demands for service, 
        80 percent report cuts in funding; and
Whereas individuals and organizations that are dedicated to preventing and 
        ending domestic violence should be recognized: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Domestic 
        Violence Awareness Month; and
            (2) expresses the sense of the House of Representatives 
        that Congress should continue to raise awareness of domestic 
        violence and its devastating effects on individuals, families, 
        and communities, and support programs designed to end domestic 
        violence in the United States.
