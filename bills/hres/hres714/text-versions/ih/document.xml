	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas the maritime domains of the Asia-Pacific region, which include both the sea and airspace
			 above the domains, are critical to the region’s prosperity, stability, and
			 security, including global commerce;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the maritime domain in the Asia-Pacific region between the Pacific and Indian Oceans
			 includes critical sea lines of commerce and communication;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Brunei have disputed territorial
			 claims over the Spratly Islands, and China, Taiwan, and Vietnam have
			 disputed territorial claims over the Paracel Islands;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, although the United States Government is not a claimant in maritime disputes in either the
			 East China or South China Seas, the United States has an interest in the
			 peaceful diplomatic resolution of disputed claims in accordance with
			 international law, in freedom of navigation and overflight, and in the
			 free-flow of commerce free of coercion, intimidation, or the use of force;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in 2002, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China committed to
			 developing an effective Code of Conduct;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas that declaration committed all parties to those territorial disputes to <quote>reaffirm their respect for and commitment to the freedom of navigation in and over flight above the
			 South China Sea as provided for by the universally recognized principles
			 of international law</quote>, and to <quote>resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the
			 threat or use of force</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas since that time, tensions over the disputed maritime and territorial areas have increased;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on September 2010, tensions escalated in the East China Sea near the Senkaku (Diaoyutai)
			 Islands, a territory under the legal administration of Japan, when a
			 Chinese fishing vessel deliberately rammed Japanese Coast Guard patrol
			 boats;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on February 25, 2011, a frigate from the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) fired shots
			 at three fishing boats from the Philippines;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on March 2, 2011, the Government of the Philippines reported that two patrol boats from
			 China attempted to ram one of its surveillance ships;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on May 26, 2011, a maritime security vessel from China cut the cables of an exploration
			 ship from Vietnam, the Binh Minh, in the South China Sea in waters near
			 Cam Ranh Bay in the exclusive economic zone of Vietnam;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on May 31, 2011, three Chinese military vessels used guns to threaten the crews of four
			 Vietnamese fishing boats while they were fishing in the waters of the
			 Spratly Islands;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on June 9, 2011, three vessels from China, including one fishing vessel and two maritime
			 security vessels, ran into and disabled the cables of another exploration
			 ship from Vietnam, the Viking 2, in the exclusive economic zone of
			 Vietnam;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on July 22, 2011, an Indian naval vessel, sailing about 45 nautical miles off the coast of
			 Vietnam, was warned by a Chinese naval vessel that it was allegedly
			 violating Chinese territorial waters;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in April 2012, tensions escalated between the Philippines and China following a standoff
			 over the Scarborough Shoal;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in June 2012, China’s cabinet, the State Council, approved the establishment of the city of
			 Sansha to oversee the areas claimed by China in the South China Sea;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in July 2012, Chinese military authorities announced that they had established a
			 corresponding Sansha garrison in the new prefecture;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on June 23, 2012, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation invited bids for oil
			 exploration in areas within 200 nautical miles of the continental shelf
			 and within the exclusive economic zone of Vietnam;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in January 2013, a Chinese naval ship allegedly fixed its weapons-targeting radar on
			 Japanese vessels in the vicinity of the Senkaku islands in the East China
			 Sea, and, on April 23, 2013, eight Chinese marine surveillance ships
			 entered the 12-nautical-mile territorial zone off the Senkaku Islands,
			 further escalating regional tensions;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on May 9, 2013, a fatal shooting incident occurred in which shots fired from a Philippine
			 Coast Guard patrol boat resulted in the death of a Taiwanese fisherman;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on May 1, 2014, China’s state-owned energy company, CNOOC, anchored its deepwater drilling
			 rig Hai Yang Shi You 981 (HD–981) in Vietnamese waters and deployed over
			 80 vessels, including seven military vessels, to support its provocative
			 actions and attempt to change the status quo by force;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Chinese vessels accompanying Hai Yang Shi You 981 (HD–981) intimidated Vietnamese Coast
			 Guard ships in violation of the Convention on the International
			 Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, ramming multiple Vietnamese
			 vessels, and using helicopters and water cannons to obstruct others;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on May 5, 2014, vessels from the Maritime Safety Administration of China (MSAC) established
			 an exclusion zone with a radius of three nautical miles around Hai Yang
			 Shi You 981 (HD–981);</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas China’s actions in support of the Hai Yang Shi You 981 (HD–981) drilling activity
			 constitute a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by force;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, without prior consultations with the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea or other
			 nations of the Asia-Pacific region, China declared an Air Defense
			 Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the East China Sea on November 23, 2013;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas China announced that all aircraft, even if they do not intend to enter the ADIZ airspace,
			 would have to submit flight plans, maintain radio contact, and follow
			 directions from the Chinese Ministry of National Defense or face <quote>emergency defensive measures</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the <quote>rules of engagement</quote> declared by China, including the <quote>emergency defensive measures</quote>, are in violation of the concept of <quote>due regard for the safety of civil aviation</quote> under the Chicago Convention of the International Civil Aviation Organization and thereby are a
			 departure from accepted practice;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas China’s declaration of an ADIZ over the East China Sea has contributed to increased
			 uncertainty and unsafe conditions in the maritime region in East Asia and
			 the broader Asia-Pacific region;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas freedom of navigation and other lawful uses of sea and airspace in the Asia-Pacific region
			 are embodied in international law, not granted by certain states to
			 others;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government expressed profound concerns with China’s unilateral,
			 provocative, dangerous, and destabilizing declaration of such a zone,
			 including the potential for misunderstandings and miscalculations by
			 aircraft operating lawfully in international airspace;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas China’s declaration of an ADIZ in the East China Sea will not alter how the United States
			 Government conducts operations in the region or the unwavering United
			 States commitment to peace, security and stability in the Asia-Pacific
			 region;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas other governments in the Asia-Pacific region, including the Governments of Japan, Korea,
			 Philippines, Australia and Indonesia have expressed deep concern about
			 China’s declaration of such a zone, regarding it as an effort to unduly
			 infringe upon the freedom of flight in international airspace and to
			 change the status quo that could escalate tensions and potentially cause
			 unintentional consequences in the East China Sea;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government does not support unilateral actions taken by any claimant
			 seeking to change the status quo through the use of coercion,
			 intimidation, or military force;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government is deeply concerned about unilateral actions taken by any
			 state to prevent any other state from exercising its sovereign rights to
			 the resources of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf
			 by making claims to those areas that have no apparent basis in
			 international law; declarations of administrative and military districts
			 in contested areas in the South and East China Seas; and the imposition of
			 new fishing regulations covering disputed areas, which have raised
			 tensions in the region;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas international law is important to safeguard the rights and freedoms of all states in the
			 Asia-Pacific region; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a peaceful and prosperous China, which acts as a responsible international stakeholder and
			 which respects international laws, standards, and institutions, will
			 enhance security and peace in the Asia-Pacific region: Now, therefore, be
			 it</text></whereas></preamble>
