                               RESOLUTION


 
          Recognizing the significance of Black History Month.

Whereas the first Africans were brought involuntarily to the shores of the 
        America as early as the 17th century;
Whereas these Africans in America and their descendants are now known as 
        African-Americans;
Whereas African-Americans suffered enslavement and subsequently faced the 
        injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, and denial of basic, fundamental 
        rights;
Whereas despite slavery, African-Americans in all walks of life have made 
        significant contributions throughout the history of the United States, 
        including through the--

    (1) writings of Booker T. Washington, Phyllis Wheatley, James Baldwin, 
Toni Morrison, Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and Alex Haley;

    (2) music of Mahalia Jackson, Billie Holiday, John Coltrane, Bessie 
Smith, and Duke Ellington;

    (3) resolve of athletes such as Jackie Robinson, Althea Gibson, Jesse 
Owens, Wilma Rudolph, and Muhammad Ali;

    (4) scientific advancements of George Washington Carver, Charles Drew, 
Benjamin Banneker, and Mae Jemison;

    (5) vision of leaders such as Frederick Douglass, Mary McLeod Bethune, 
Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Shirley Chisholm; and

    (6) bravery of those who stood on the front lines in the battle against 
oppression, such as Sojourner Truth, Fannie Lou Hammer, and Rosa Parks;

Whereas in the face of injustices, United States citizens of good will and of 
        all races distinguished themselves with their commitment to the noble 
        ideals upon which the United States was founded and courageously fought 
        for the rights and freedom of African-Americans;
Whereas Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., lived and died to make real these noble 
        ideas;
Whereas a memorial commemorating the life and ideals of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
        Jr., was placed on the National Mall for all people to observe his 
        struggle for freedom and truth;
Whereas Barack Hussein Obama was elected and reelected the 44th President of the 
        United States, making him the first African-American chief executive and 
        breaking one of the last racial barriers in politics in this country;
Whereas the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass inspired the 
        creation of Negro History Week, the precursor to Black History Month;
Whereas Negro History Week represented the culmination of Dr. Carter G. 
        Woodson's efforts to enhance knowledge of Black history started through 
        the Journal of Negro History, published by Woodson's Association for the 
        Study of African-American Life and History; and
Whereas the month of February is officially celebrated as Black History Month, 
        which dates back to 1926, when Dr. Carter G. Woodson set aside a special 
        period of time in February to recognize the heritage and achievement of 
        Black Americans: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the significance of Black History Month as 
        an important time to recognize the contributions of African-
        Americans in the Nation's history, and encourages the continued 
        celebration of this month to provide an opportunity for all 
        peoples of the United States to learn more about the past and 
        to better understand the experiences that have shaped the 
        Nation;
            (2) recognizes that ethnic and racial diversity of the 
        United States enriches and strengthens the Nation;
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to use Black 
        History Month as an opportunity to learn about the past and to 
        better understand the experiences that have shaped the Nation; 
        and
            (4) encourages all States to include in their year-round 
        educational curriculum the history and contributions of 
        African-Americans in the United States and around the world.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
