                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring the Good Friday Agreement (the Belfast Agreement), on the 15th 
anniversary of its ratification, as the framework for lasting peace in 
                           Northern Ireland.

Whereas the Good Friday Agreement represented a landmark breakthrough that 
        provided Ireland with a political framework to address its future;
Whereas the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged the right of differing political 
        traditions to pursue their goals of remaining part of the United Kingdom 
        or of Irish Unity;
Whereas the Good Friday Agreement demonstrated democratic and peaceful means of 
        resolving differences;
Whereas members of both political parties in the United States came together to 
        support the Good Friday Agreement; and
Whereas the Good Friday Agreement promotes religious freedom, democracy, and 
        human rights: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of the Good Friday 
        Agreement;
            (2) urges all communities to continue to engage in the 
        legal political process;
            (3) calls on the Governments of the United Kingdom and 
        Ireland to work together to achieve full implementation of the 
        Good Friday Agreement, including the creation of a Bill of 
        Rights for Northern Ireland; and
            (4) recognizes the urgent and ongoing necessity of 
        reconciliation, and urges the involvement of the United 
        Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and communities to work 
        toward genuine reconciliation.
                                 <all>
