 Recognizing the significance of National Caribbean American Heritage 
                                 Month.

Whereas people of Caribbean heritage are found in every State of the Union;
Whereas emigration from the Caribbean region to the American colonies began as 
        early as 1619 with the arrival of indentured workers in Jamestown, 
        Virginia;
Whereas during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, a significant number of 
        slaves from the Caribbean region were brought to the United States;
Whereas since 1820, millions of people have emigrated from the Caribbean region 
        to the United States;
Whereas like the United States, the countries of the Caribbean faced obstacles 
        of slavery and colonialism and struggled for independence;
Whereas also like the United States, the people of the Caribbean region have 
        diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds;
Whereas the independence movements throughout the Caribbean during the 1960s and 
        the consequential establishment of independent democratic countries in 
        the Caribbean strengthened ties between the region and the United 
        States;
Whereas Alexander Hamilton, a Founding Father of the United States and the first 
        Secretary of the Treasury, was born in the Caribbean;
Whereas many influential Caribbean Americans have contributed to the rich 
        history of the United States, including Jean Baptiste Pointe du Sable, 
        the pioneer settler of Chicago, Claude McKay, a poet of the Harlem 
        Renaissance, James Weldon Johnson, the writer of the Black National 
        Anthem, Celia Cruz, the world-renowned queen of Salsa music, and Shirley 
        Chisholm, the first African-American Congresswoman and first African-
        American woman candidate for President;
Whereas the many influential Caribbean Americans in the history of the United 
        States also include Colin Powell, the first African-American Secretary 
        of State, Sidney Poitier, the first African-American actor to receive 
        the Academy Award for best actor in a leading role, Harry Belafonte, a 
        musician, actor, and activist, Al Roker, a meteorologist and television 
        personality, and Roberto Clemente, the first Latino inducted into the 
        Baseball Hall of Fame;
Whereas Caribbean Americans have played an active role in the civil rights 
        movement and other social and political movements in the United States;
Whereas Caribbean Americans have contributed greatly to the fine arts, 
        education, business, literature, journalism, sports, fashion, politics, 
        government, the military, music, science, technology, and other fields 
        in the United States;
Whereas Caribbean Americans share their culture through festivals, carnivals, 
        music, dance, film, and literature, which enrich the cultural landscape 
        of the United States;
Whereas the countries of the Caribbean are important economic partners of the 
        United States;
Whereas the countries of the Caribbean represent the United States third border;
Whereas the people of the Caribbean region share the hopes and aspirations of 
        the people of the United States for peace and prosperity throughout the 
        Western Hemisphere and the rest of the world;
Whereas since the passage of H. Con. Res. 71 in the 109th Congress by both the 
        Senate and the House of Representatives, a proclamation has been issued 
        annually by the President declaring June National Caribbean American 
        Heritage Month; and
Whereas 2014 is the first ever United Nations designation of the Year of Small 
        Island Developing States to celebrate the contributions that this group 
        of countries has made to the world, as well as the vibrant and distinct 
        cultures, diversity and heritage in this part of the world: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Caribbean American 
        Heritage Month;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Caribbean American Heritage Month with appropriate ceremonies, 
        celebrations, and activities; and
            (3) affirms that--
                    (A) the contributions of Caribbean Americans are a 
                significant part of the history, progress, and heritage 
                of the United States; and
                    (B) the ethnic and racial diversity of the United 
                States enriches and strengthens the Nation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
