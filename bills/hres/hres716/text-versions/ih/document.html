                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President 
 and the Secretary of State should ensure that the Canadian Government 
   does not permanently store nuclear waste in the Great Lakes Basin.

Whereas the water resources of the Great Lakes Basin are precious public natural 
        resources, shared by the Great Lakes States and the Canadian Provinces;
Whereas the United States and Canada have, since 1909, worked to maintain and 
        improve the water quality of the Great Lakes through water quality 
        agreements;
Whereas over 40,000,000 people in both Canada and the United States depend on 
        the fresh water from the Great Lakes for drinking water;
Whereas Ontario Power Generation is proposing to build a permanent geological 
        repository for nuclear waste less than one mile from Lake Huron in 
        Kincardine, Ontario, Canada;
Whereas nuclear waste is highly toxic and can take tens of thousands of years to 
        decompose to safe levels;
Whereas during the 1980s when the Department of Energy, in accordance with the 
        Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, was studying potential sites for a 
        permanent nuclear waste repository in the United States, the Canadian 
        Government expressed concern with locating a permanent nuclear waste 
        repository within shared water basins of the two countries; and
Whereas a spill of nuclear waste into the Great Lakes could have lasting and 
        severely adverse environmental, health, and economic impacts on the 
        Great Lakes and the people that depend on them for their livelihood: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the Canadian Government should not allow a permanent 
        nuclear waste repository to be built within the Great Lakes 
        Basin;
            (2) the President and the Secretary of State should take 
        appropriate action to work with the Canadian Government to 
        prevent a permanent nuclear waste repository from being built 
        within the Great Lakes Basin; and
            (3) the President and the Secretary of State should work 
        together with their Canadian Government counterparts on a safe 
        and responsible solution for the long-term storage of nuclear 
        waste.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
