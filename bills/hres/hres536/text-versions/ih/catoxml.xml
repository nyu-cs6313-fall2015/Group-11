		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas all people in the United States rely on quality, efficient, and dependable telephone
			 service in many aspects of life, including conducting business, securing
			 the safety of the public, and connecting families;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas multiple surveys conducted by the National Exchange Carrier Association revealed that
			 complaints of uncompleted telephone calls persist, with the most recent
			 survey in October 2012 indicating a 41 percent increase in uncompleted
			 calls between March and September of the same year;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the National Exchange Carrier Association and rural telecommunications carriers in April
			 2012 supplied information that—</text>
			<paragraph id="idE84DED240A4D4D82B2E991CA44CD83FC">
        <enum>(1)</enum>
        <text>6.4 percent of calls to rural areas failed, but only 0.5 percent of calls to urban areas failed;

      <paragraph id="id57ABD48ACAC446BB95A1C7088265CED1">
        <enum>(2)</enum>
        <text>11 percent of calls to rural areas were either poor quality or were delayed, compared to only 5
			 percent in urban areas;</text>

    </whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="2700">Federal Communications Commission</cato:entity-ref> was made
			 aware of an issue regarding telephone service connection in rural areas in
			 November 2010 and has since issued a declaratory ruling and a notice of
			 proposed rulemaking with respect to the issue and has reached a settlement with
			 one telecommunications carrier;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, in a declaratory ruling in February 2012, the Federal Communications Commission made it
			 clear that blocking or otherwise restricting telephone service is a
			 violation of <cato:entity entity-type="law-citation">
          <cato:entity-ref entity-type="act" value="Communications Act of 1934/s:201/ss:b">section 201(b) of the Communications Act of 1934</cato:entity-ref> (<cato:entity-ref entity-type="uscode" value="usc/47/201/b">47 U.S.C.

          </external-xref>)</cato:entity>, which outlines the duty of a
			 telecommunications carrier to refrain from discrimination;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas actions by the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="2700">Federal Communications Commission</cato:entity-ref>
			 have not significantly decreased the prevalence of telephone calls being
			 rerouted by telecommunications carriers and some States are seeing an increase
			 in complaints as of April 2013;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, in October 2013, the <cato:entity-ref entity-type="federal-body" entity-id="2700">Federal Communications Commission</cato:entity-ref> adopted a Report and Order and
			 Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FCC 13–135) requiring some
			 providers of long-distance telephone service to record, retain, and report
			 call completion data to the Commission and prohibiting all originating and
			 intermediate providers from causing audible ringing to be sent to the
			 caller before the terminating provider has signaled that the called party
			 is being alerted;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas telephone communications are vital to keeping rural areas of the United States competitive
			 in the economy, and a low rate of telephone call completion results in
			 economic injury to rural businesses, including farmers, trucking
			 companies, and suppliers who have seen thousands of dollars in business
			 lost when telephone calls are not completed;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the safety of the public is at risk from a lack of quality telephone communications,
			 including 911 services;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas schools depend on telephone calls to notify students and parents of emergencies, and health
			 care centers depend on telecommunications services to save lives and to
			 communicate with rural patients;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas small, local telecommunications carriers are losing valuable, multi-line business
			 subscribers because of a lack of quality telecommunications services,
			 which is financially detrimental to those carriers and adversely affects
			 the rural communities served by those carriers; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it may cost a telecommunications carrier serving a rural area hundreds of dollars to
			 investigate each complaint of an uncompleted telephone call: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text>
