Expressing support for the designation of the third week in October as

       that week as National School Bus Drivers Appreciation Day.

Whereas school bus drivers and all school transportation staff, including

        substantial contributions to the future of America and to the 
        development of our Nation's young people as knowledgeable, responsible 
        and productive citizens;
Whereas excellence in education is dependent on safe, secure, and peaceful 
        routes to school and school settings;
Whereas the safety and well-being of many students rely on school bus drivers 
        and the school transportation team to get them to and from school and 
        other events in a safe, professional manner;
Whereas school bus drivers and all school transportation staff, including 
        managers, monitors, trainers, mechanics and dispatchers, are an 
        invaluable component of our educational system and have preformed an 
        outstanding job transporting our most precious resource, young students; 
        and
Whereas the third week in October will be designated as National School Bus 
        Safety Week and the Wednesday of that week will be designated as 
        National School Bus Drivers Appreciation Day to promote efforts to 
        provide all our Nation's schools with positive and safe learning 
        climates: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) celebrates the dedication and contributions that school 
        bus drivers, managers, trainers, monitors, mechanics and 
        dispatchers make for our children every day across the country;
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of National School Bus 
        Safety Week and National School Bus Drivers Appreciation Day; 
        and
            (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
        such a week and such a day with appropriate ceremonies, 
        programs, and activities.
