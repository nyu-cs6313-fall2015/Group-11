                               RESOLUTION


 
  Honoring the lives, work, and sacrifice of Joseph Curseen, Jr., and 
Thomas Morris, Jr., the two United States Postal Service employees and 
  Washington, DC, natives who died as a result of their contact with 
 anthrax while working at the United States Postal Facility located at 
 900 Brentwood Road, NE, Washington, DC, during the anthrax attack in 
  the fall of 2001, United States Postal Service employees, who have 
  continued to work diligently in service to the people of the United 
States notwithstanding the anthrax attacks, as well as the three other 
      Americans who died and the 17 who became ill in the attacks.

Whereas the founders of the United States, recognizing the importance of a 
        national system of mail to the new country, gave Congress the 
        constitutional authority ``To establish post offices and post roads'';
Whereas employees of the United States Postal Service provide indispensable 
        public service and honorably represent the United States on a daily 
        basis;
Whereas despite the other terrorist attacks in Federal facilities throughout the 
        United States, including the anthrax attacks more than 10 years ago, 
        Postal Service employees continue to risk their lives daily to serve the 
        people of the United States;
Whereas Joseph P. Curseen, Jr., and Thomas L. Morris, Jr., both natives of 
        Washington, DC, diligently and admirably served the Nation for decades 
        as employees of the United States Postal Service;
Whereas in the fall of 2001, during the course of their jobs with the United 
        States Postal Service, Joseph Curseen, Jr., and Thomas Morris, Jr., were 
        exposed to letters containing anthrax that were placed in the mail and 
        subsequently suffered from the inhalation of anthrax and thereafter 
        died;
Whereas 5 United States citizens died from exposure to anthrax during the 2001 
        anthrax attacks and 17 became ill in the worst biological attack in the 
        Nation's history; and
Whereas in 2002, the United States Postal Service facility located at 900 
        Brentwood Road, NE, Washington, DC, was designated as the ``Joseph 
        Curseen, Jr. and Thomas Morris, Jr. Processing and Distribution Center'' 
        by Public Law 107-225: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives honors the lives and 
work of Joseph Curseen, Jr., Thomas Morris, Jr., the three Americans 
who died, and the 17 who became ill in the attacks, and acknowledges 
the sacrifice that all Postal Service employees make on behalf of the 
United States on a daily basis.
                                 <all>
