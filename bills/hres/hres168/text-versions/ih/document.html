     Condemning the horrific attacks of April 15, 2013, in Boston, 
 Massachusetts, and expressing support, sympathy, and prayers for all 
                   persons impacted by this tragedy.

Whereas the two bombings that occurred in Boston, Massachusetts, on Patriots' 
        Day, April 15, 2013, during the running of the 117th Boston Marathon 
        represent a terrible tragedy and horrific act of terrorism against the 
        people of the United States;
Whereas the people of the United States mourn for those persons who lost their 
        lives or were wounded in the attacks;
Whereas police, firefighters, National Guard personnel, emergency medical 
        personnel, and other first responders acted promptly and heroically in 
        responding to the attacks, thereby helping to prevent additional losses 
        of life;
Whereas the full resources of the Federal, State, and local governments are 
        being brought to bear to investigate these attacks and to bring the 
        perpetrator or perpetrators to justice;
Whereas the citizens of Massachusetts are a resilient people and will recover 
        from this tragedy; and
Whereas the people of the United States will always remember the victims of the 
        previous acts of terrorism that have occurred in the United States and 
        will always stand together as one people: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the senseless attacks in Boston, 
        Massachusetts, on Monday, April 15, 2013;
            (2) offers sympathy and condolences to the victims' 
        families;
            (3) sends thoughts and prayers for those persons who are 
        recovering from injuries;
            (4) honors the heroic efforts of medical personnel who are 
        tirelessly providing care for the victims of this horrific act 
        of violence;
            (5) admires the courage of first responders and the many 
        citizen heroes who aided the injured and tended to the 
        community;
            (6) commits to providing all necessary resources to law 
        enforcement officials who are investigating the terrorist 
        attacks;
            (7) commits to working together as united Americans to 
        bring the perpetrator or perpetrators of the attacks to 
        justice; and
            (8) recognizes that the city of Boston, the people of 
        Massachusetts, and all Americans will rise up from this tragedy 
        and stand together as patriots.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
