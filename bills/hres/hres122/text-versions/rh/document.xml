			 of this resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII,
			 declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state
			 of the Union for consideration of the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 25)
			 establishing the budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2014
			 and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2015 through
			 2023. The first reading of the concurrent resolution shall be dispensed with.
			 All points of order against consideration of the concurrent resolution are
			 waived. General debate shall not exceed four hours, with three hours of general
			 debate confined to the congressional budget equally divided and controlled by
			 the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget and one
			 hour of general debate on the subject of economic goals and policies equally
			 divided and controlled by Representative Brady of Texas and Representative
			 Carolyn Maloney of New York or their respective designees. After general debate
			 the concurrent resolution shall be considered for amendment under the
			 five-minute rule. The concurrent resolution shall be considered as read. No
			 amendment shall be in order except those printed in the report of the Committee
			 on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each amendment may be offered only in
			 the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in
			 the report, shall be considered as read, and shall be debatable for the time
			 specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an
			 opponent. All points of order against such amendments are waived except that
			 the adoption of an amendment in the nature of a substitute shall constitute the
			 conclusion of consideration of the concurrent resolution for amendment. After
			 the conclusion of consideration of the concurrent resolution for amendment and
			 a final period of general debate, which shall not exceed 10 minutes equally
			 divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the
			 Committee on the Budget, the Committee shall rise and report the concurrent
			 resolution to the House with such amendment as may have been adopted. The
			 previous question shall be considered as ordered on the concurrent resolution
			 and amendments thereto to adoption without intervening motion except amendments
			 offered by the chair of the Committee on the Budget pursuant to section
			 305(a)(5) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to achieve mathematical
			 consistency. The concurrent resolution shall not be subject to a demand for
			 division of the question of its adoption.</text>
