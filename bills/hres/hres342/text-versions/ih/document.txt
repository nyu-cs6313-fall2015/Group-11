                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of September 2013 as ``National 
               Sepsis and Septic Shock Awareness Month''.

Whereas sepsis is a medical condition that occurs due to an immune response to 
        infection;
Whereas the released immune chemicals into the blood to fight infection can 
        cause impaired blood flow, which injures the body's organs;
Whereas in severe cases blood pressure drops, the heart weakens, and septic 
        shock can occur, exposing the patient to multiple organ failure which 
        can lead to death;
Whereas sepsis is a serious medical condition and a leading cause of death;
Whereas about 750,000 people in the United States are infected by sepsis 
        annually;
Whereas the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the National 
        Institutes of Health has estimated that between 28 and 50 percent of 
        people infected die, attributing to more United States deaths than 
        prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined;
Whereas it is estimated that approximately $17,000,000,000 annually is spent 
        combating sepsis in the United States;
Whereas the number of sepsis related deaths is currently on the rise in the 
        United States;
Whereas many symptoms of sepsis mimic other conditions, making sepsis difficult 
        to diagnose; and
Whereas September 2013 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National 
        Sepsis and Septic Shock Awareness Month'' to raise awareness and 
        encourage the education of patients, families, and health care 
        professionals on the seriousness of early detection as the key to 
        survival: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representative supports the designation 
of ``National Sepsis and Septic Shock Awareness Month''.
                                 <all>
