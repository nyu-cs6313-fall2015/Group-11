  <summary>12/12/2013--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that: (1) it is U.S. policy to promote the right to nationality without arbitrary deprivation by any state as articulated in Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of the Human Rights, and (2) the U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States (OAS) should pursue a multilateral approach to address the potential crisis in the Dominican Republic as a result of that nation's Constitutional Court ruling on September 23, 2013, that could render hundreds of thousands of Dominican-born persons stateless.</summary>
