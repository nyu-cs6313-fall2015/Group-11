                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting a moratorium on the sale of historic post office buildings.

Whereas the United States Postal Service is an American institution dating back 
        to the colonial era;
Whereas the United States Postal Service is the core of a $1 trillion mailing 
        industry that employs more than 8 million people;
Whereas in 2012, the Postal Service--

    (1) processed 160 billion pieces of mail;

    (2) handled 40 percent of the world's mail volume;

    (3) paid $3.6 billion every month in salaries and benefits;

    (4) employed 108,000 veterans; and

    (5) managed 31,272 retail offices;

Whereas the United States Postal Service employs a Federal preservation officer 
        and a historian;
Whereas the United States Postal Service has a diverse fine arts collection 
        consisting of works of art from many different sources and programs;
Whereas the United States Postal Service houses more than 1,400 murals and 
        sculptures from President Roosevelt's New Deal programs in its post 
        offices around the Nation;
Whereas most of the post office works of art were funded through commissions 
        under the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture and 
        Section of Fine Arts; and
Whereas as of December 2012, 998 postal buildings are listed on the National 
        Historic Register. Now, therefore, be it:
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of preserving the United 
        States Postal Service's long history and protecting the 
        Nation's historic properties; and
            (2) opposes the sale of historic post office buildings and 
        urges the Postal Service to halt current sales of recognized 
        historic places and remove all such properties from the sales 
        list.
                                 <all>
