		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas dyslexia is a brain-based learning disability that specifically impairs a person’s ability
			 to read;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a specific learning disability is a brain-based genetic characteristic that results in the
			 imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell, or do
			 mathematical calculations, and often impacts overall school success;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas dyslexia is a specific learning disability;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas common characteristics among people with dyslexia include difficulty with phonological
			 processing, spelling, and rapid visual-verbal responding;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas an estimated 10 percent of individuals have some form of dyslexia;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas dyslexia is more common in boys than in girls;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas specific learning disabilities are highly prevalent yet 1 in 20 public school students are
			 identified with them;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas learning and attention issues often affect students who have a weakness in a specific skill
			 area, but it is important to recognize that these students have strengths
			 in higher-level cognitive functions, such as reasoning, critical thinking,
			 concept formation, and problem-solving;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas dyslexia can be inherited, and recent studies have identified a number of genes that may
			 predispose an individual to developing dyslexia;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas treatment for dyslexia should include modifying teaching methods and the educational
			 environment to meet the specific needs of the individual with dyslexia;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas dyslexia affects a wide range of people and produces different symptoms at varying degrees
			 of severity so predictions are hard to make;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the prognosis for individuals with dyslexia is generally good for individuals whose
			 dyslexia is identified early, who have supportive family and friends and a
			 strong self-image, and who are involved in a proper remediation program;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas current research avenues focus on developing techniques to diagnose and treat dyslexia and
			 other learning disabilities, increasing the understanding of the
			 biological and possible genetic bases of learning disabilities, and
			 exploring the relationship between neurophysiological processes and
			 cognitive functions with regard to reading ability and learning;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas great progress has been made in understanding learning and attention deficient issues at a
			 scientific level, including their epidemiology, cognitive and
			 neurobiological bases, and in the use of assistive technology to improve
			 access to learning;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas early identification of learning and attention issues is critical and must lead to focused,
			 evidenced-based interventions, necessary accommodations, self-awareness,
			 self-empowerment, and school and life success; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas enforcing existing Federal civil rights and education law on this matter will improve
			 access to learning for all: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
