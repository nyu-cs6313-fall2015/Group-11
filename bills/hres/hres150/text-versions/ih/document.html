 Congratulating the Florida Gulf Coast University Eagles for becoming 
the first 15 seed to advance to the ``Sweet 16'' 4th Round in the NCAA 
                      Men's Basketball Tournament.

Whereas, on March 22, 2012, the Florida Gulf Coast University Eagles, in their 
        second season of NCAA Division I postseason eligibility, upset the 
        Georgetown University Hoyas 78-68;
Whereas, on March 24, 2012, the Eagles defeated the San Diego State University 
        Aztecs 81-71;
Whereas in each win the Eagles pulled away with scoring runs of 21-2 versus 
        Georgetown and 17-0 over the Aztecs;
Whereas Sherwood Brown and Bernard Thompson combined for 87 points and Brett 
        Comer had 24 assists across the two games;
Whereas Coach Andy Enfield has lived up to his promise to not wait to win;
Whereas senior Eddie Murray, juniors Nate Hicks, Christophe Varidel, Jamail 
        Jones, and Chase Fieler, sophomores Eric McKnight, Filip Cvjeticanin, 
        and Marcus Blake, and freshmen Alexander Bessig, Leonard Livingston, 
        Jr., and Dajuan Graf have also contributed greatly;
Whereas in matching their next opponent, the University of Florida, the Eagles 
        became the second team to win their first two postseason games;
Whereas their exciting dunks and alley-oops have electrified fans and earned 
        Fort Myers the nickname ``Dunk City'';
Whereas the chicken dance celebration is innovative and entertaining;
Whereas even the announcers have begun to cheer for this exceptional group of 
        players;
Whereas the Florida Gulf Coast University Eagles have inspired a Nation and 
        brought the spotlight to a great school in Southwest Florida while 
        making history: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives congratulates the 
Florida Gulf Coast University on its first two postseason victories and 
becoming the first 15th seeded team to reach the ``Sweet 16'' round in 
the Division I NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.
