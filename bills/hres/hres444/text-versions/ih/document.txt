  Honoring the accomplishments of Nicarsia ``Nikki'' Mayes, a Capitol 
  Hill trailblazer and the first African-American woman to serve as a

Whereas Nicarsia ``Nikki'' Mayes began her career of service to the House of

        the last ``Members Only'' manual elevator;
Whereas in 1980, Nicarsia ``Nikki'' Mayes was hired as a staff member of the

Whereas in 1994, Nicarsia ``Nikki'' Mayes joined the staff of the Office of the 
        Sergeant at Arms, serving as a member of the Chamber Security Division 
        until her retirement in 2013;
Whereas Nicarsia ``Nikki'' Mayes' excellent performance, distinguished service, 
        professionalism, and good cheer paved the way for more African-Americans 
        to join the appointments as Office of the Sergeant at Arms and other 
        important House institutions, earned her the respect and friendship of 
        her colleagues, and endeared her to Members of Congress;
Whereas in December 2013, Nicarsia ``Nikki'' Mayes retired from active duty 
        after 36 years of faithful, honorable, and distinguished service to the 
        United States House of Representatives; and
Whereas Nicarsia ``Nikki'' Mayes is the mother of three children, sons John 
        Mayes III and David, and a daughter, Tira, all of whom she instilled the 
        importance of public service and each of whom followed her example: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives commends Nicarsia 
``Nikki'' Mayes for her distinguished career of service to the House of 
Representatives and the people of the United States.
