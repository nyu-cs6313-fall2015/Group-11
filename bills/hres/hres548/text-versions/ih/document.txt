                under this subdivision is a program which provides 
                information and practical guidance regarding any 
                applicable Federal and State laws concerning the 
                prohibition against and the prevention and correction 
                of sexual harassment and the remedies available to 
                victims of sexual harassment in employment. The program 
                shall also include practical examples aimed at 
                instructing supervisors in the prevention of 
                harassment, discrimination, and retaliation, and shall 
                be presented by individuals with knowledge and

                discrimination, and retaliation.
            ``(ii) The program under this subdivision shall provide at 
        least one hour of training, except that in the case of the

        by the individual to such conduct is made either explicitly or 
        implicitly a term or condition of the individual's employment, 
        submission to or rejection of such conduct by the individual is 
        used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the 
        individual, or such conduct has the purpose or effect of 
        interfering with the individual's work performance or creating 
        an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall
