  Recognizing the centennial of Camp Grayling Joint Maneuver Training 
                    Center in the State of Michigan.

Whereas Camp Grayling Joint Maneuver Training Center in the State of Michigan 
        was established by an act of the Michigan Legislature on May 2, 1913, 
        with an initial grant of land from Grayling timber industrialist Rasmus 
        Hanson;
Whereas Camp Grayling is the largest National Guard training facility in the 
        United States, spanning 147,000 acres of training land;
Whereas Camp Grayling provides over 200 full-time jobs to Michigan residents and 
        generates over $20 million annually in local economic impact;
Whereas Camp Grayling annually trains over 10,000 members of National Guard 
        units from Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio and members of regular 
        and Reserve units of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast 
        Guard;
Whereas over 100 law enforcement agencies train at Camp Grayling as part of the 
        Northern Michigan Law Enforcement Training Group;
Whereas units of the Canadian Armed Forces train at Camp Grayling, and Camp 
        Grayling is also used by visiting Armed Forces from Latvia, the United 
        Kingdom, Hungary, and Serbia;
Whereas Camp Grayling served as the pre-mobilization training site for thousands 
        of members of the Armed Forces who participated in Operation Desert 
        Shield, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Iraqi 
        Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom;
Whereas Camp Grayling has received recognition and numerous awards at the local, 
        State, and national level for its environmental stewardship, including 
        the guardianship of two federally protected species found on 
        installation training lands;
Whereas Camp Grayling facilities and ranges are able to support a full spectrum 
        of virtual and digital military training activities, from individual 
        weapons qualification to complex armor, artillery, urban assault, 
        counter-IED, and close air support operations; and
Whereas since the attacks on September 11, 2001, hundreds of thousands of 
        members of the National Guard, many of whom received training at Camp 
        Grayling, have been called upon by their States and the Federal 
        Government to provide security at home and combat terrorism abroad: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) thanks the civilians and members of the National Guard 
        who have staffed and maintained Camp Grayling Joint Maneuver 
        Training Center in the State of Michigan for their service and 
        unique contribution to the security of the United States;
            (2) honors and supports the compassionate, courageous, and 
        dedicated members of the National Guard who serve a critical 
        role in protecting the United States and its citizens' freedoms 
        and treasured liberties; and
            (3) congratulates Camp Grayling for 100 years of sterling 
        service.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
