                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that any 
 immigration reform proposal adopted by Congress should not legalize, 
   grant amnesty for, or confer any other legal status condoning the 
   otherwise unlawful entry or presence in the United States of any 
                              individual.

Whereas on November 6, 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 
        1986 was signed into law;
Whereas between 1987 and 1988, nearly 2,700,000 illegal immigrants received 
        legal status under the 1986 IRCA amnesty before being granted lawful 
        permanent residence by 1992;
Whereas IRCA was touted by its sponsors as the ``three-legged stool'' approach 
        to immigration reform incorporating improved border security and 
        employment enforcement, a H-2A temporary worker program, and legal 
        status for certain eligible groups;
Whereas IRCA contained provisions to inhibit future illegal immigration by 
        penalizing employers who knowingly hire an unauthorized immigrant;
Whereas despite these penalties, a policy brief by the Migration Policy 
        Institute dated August 2005 showed that over 90 percent of unauthorized 
        males in the United States were employed;
Whereas IRCA included language to increase Border Personnel by 50 percent;
Whereas then-Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Commissioner Alan C. 
        Nelson announced the law's initial success in a 1989 House Judiciary 
        Committee hearing, citing the shrinking number of apprehensions at the 
        border, as signal ``to demonstrate that the law is working and employer 
        sanctions are having the intended effect of reducing illegal 
        immigration'';
Whereas illegal immigration actually increased in volume and frequency by 1989, 
        with 1,700,000 to 2,500,000 unauthorized immigrants crossing into the 
        United States from Mexico that year;
Whereas the number of illegal aliens grew to 3,400,000 by the early 1990s, and 
        by 1997 the approximate unauthorized population totaled more than 
        5,000,000, the same number of illegal immigrants as before the 1986 law 
        took effect; and
Whereas an estimated 11,500,000 million illegal aliens currently reside in the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
any immigration reform proposal adopted by Congress should not 
legalize, grant amnesty for, or confer any other legal status condoning 
the otherwise unlawful entry or presence in the United States of any 
individual.
