 Honoring the life, legacy, and example of Congressman Leo J. Ryan 35 
                     years after his tragic death.

Whereas the Honorable Leo J. Ryan served in the House of Representatives from 
        1972 to 1978 and championed causes related to equality, freedom, and 
        human rights;
Whereas Congressman Ryan, as presiding chairman of the California Assembly 
        committee overseeing prison reform, entered Folsom Prison in 1970 under 
        a pseudonym in an effort to uncover alleged abuses against convicts in 
        California's prisons;
Whereas Congressman Ryan, while serving in the California Assembly, chose to 
        serve as a substitute teacher in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles 
        in order to investigate the conditions following the Watts Riots;
Whereas Congressman Ryan, after hearing reports of United States citizens being 
        held against their will in a prison camp atmosphere within the Guyana 
        settlement of the People's Temple organization, went on a fact finding 
        mission to Jonestown, Guyana;
Whereas on November 14, 1978, Congressman Ryan flew to Georgetown, Guyana along 
        with a delegation of 18 people, including now-Congresswoman Jackie 
        Speier of California as his legal advisor;
Whereas on November 18, 1978, Congressman Ryan, 3 journalists, and a defecting 
        member of the People's Temple were killed by gunfire, which wounded 9 
        others, including Congresswoman Speier;
Whereas 909 members of the People's Temple committed suicide shortly after the 
        murders on the airstrip;
Whereas Congresswoman Jackie Speier had to endure the pain of 5 gunshot wounds 
        for more than 22 hours before help arrived;
Whereas Congressman Ryan is one of a small number of Members of Congress who 
        have been killed in the line of duty; and
Whereas Congressman Ryan dedicated his life to the cause of democracy, freedom, 
        and human rights for the people of California, the United States, and 
        the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors the legacy of Congressman Leo J. Ryan for his 
        lifelong commitment to objective fact-finding and for his 
        extraordinary commitment to advancing freedom and basic human 
        rights at home and abroad;
            (2) honors the bravery of Congressman Ryan and his team 
        members, including now-Congresswoman Jackie Speier, for 
        undertaking a dangerous yet essential fact-finding mission in 
        Guyana;
            (3) extends its condolences to all those affected by the 
        Jonestown tragedy;
            (4) reiterates its continued support for the safety of all 
        government officials traveling on behalf of the United States 
        on fact-finding missions; and
            (5) calls upon the Speaker of the House of Representatives 
        to establish protocols for memorializing Members who die in the 
        line of duty.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
