                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the historical links and friendship between Scotland and 
   the United States and respectfully supporting a truly democratic 
                                process.

Whereas the links between the people of the United States and the people of 
        Scotland includes three centuries of lineage, cultural, political, 
        military, and economic relations;
Whereas Scotland has directly influenced the foundation of United States 
        democracy, individual freedom, self-representation, and to this day this 
        legacy continues;
Whereas Founding Father, Thomas Jefferson, embodied these Scottish Values and 
        translated them into the United States Declaration of Independence, 
        reaffirming that millions of people in the United States have Scottish 
        roots and identify with their Scottish ancestry, and Scottish people and 
        culture have had a profound effect on the United States throughout its 
        history;
Whereas under the devolution settlement, Scotland has achieved a degree of self-
        governance, but not full self determination;
Whereas in accordance with an agreement between the Governments of Scotland and 
        the United Kingdom, a referendum will be held in Scotland on September 
        18, 2014, on whether Scotland should be an independent country; and
Whereas, on June 5, 2014, President Barack Obama stated that the decision on 
        independence is ``up to the people of Scotland'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) believes that the future of Scotland can only be 
        determined by the People of Scotland on September 18, 2014;
            (2) expresses support of the manner in which the 
        independence debate is being conducted in a peaceful, 
        inclusive, and democratic way, and commends it as an example to 
        the rest of the world;
            (3) expresses deep friendship toward the Scottish people; 
        and
            (4) believes that a strong and prosperous Scotland is 
        important for United States national priorities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
