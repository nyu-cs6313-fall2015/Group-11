                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the friendship between the United Kingdom and the United 
States and expressing the support of the House of Representatives for a 
             united, secure, and prosperous United Kingdom.

Whereas the history and friendship between the people of the United States and 
        the people of the United Kingdom includes nearly two and a half 
        centuries of cultural, political, military, economic, and diplomatic 
        relations;
Whereas this relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is 
        based on shared values of democracy, individual freedom, and the rule of 
        law;
Whereas British statesman Winston Churchill in 1946 labeled the relationship 
        between the United States and the United Kingdom the Special 
        Relationship because of the unprecedented depth of cooperation and the 
        extensive historic ties between the two nations;
Whereas throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries, the United States and the 
        United Kingdom fought together in several struggles, including the First 
        and Second World Wars, in which millions of American and British 
        soldiers sacrificed for their countries;
Whereas millions of Americans have Scottish roots and identify with their 
        Scottish ancestry, and Scottish people and culture have had a profound 
        effect on the United States throughout its history;
Whereas the 300th anniversary of the Union of Scotland and England occurred on 
        May 1, 2007;
Whereas the United Kingdom, a nation of over 63 million people, is the world's 
        sixth-largest economy and an influential power with cultural, economic, 
        and political influence around the world;
Whereas in the United Kingdom, a system of devolution provides a statutory 
        granting of powers from the Parliament of the United Kingdom to the 
        Scottish Parliament and its executive body, the Scottish Government;
Whereas in accordance with an agreement between the Scottish Government and the 
        United Kingdom Government, a referendum will be held in Scotland on 
        September 18, 2014, on whether Scotland should be an independent 
        country; and
Whereas on June 5, 2014, speaking alongside the Prime Minister of the United 
        Kingdom, David Cameron, the President of the United States, Barack 
        Obama, said the United States has a ``deep interest in making sure that 
        one of the closest allies we will ever have remains a strong, robust, 
        united and effective partner'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) believes that a united, secure, and prosperous United 
        Kingdom is important for U.S. national security priorities in 
        Europe and around the world;
            (2) believes that diplomatic, economic, and military 
        cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom in 
        bilateral, trans-Atlantic, and global arenas is essential to 
        the national security of the United States;
            (3) expresses deep friendship toward the Scottish people;
            (4) respects the right of the Scottish people to make their 
        decision regarding their status in the September 18, 2014, 
        referendum;
            (5) expresses a firm commitment to continued cooperation 
        between the United States and the United Kingdom toward a more 
        peaceful and prosperous world; and
            (6) expresses support for a united, secure, and prosperous 
        United Kingdom.
                                 <all>
