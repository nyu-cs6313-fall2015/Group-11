                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of March 29 as Vietnam Veterans Day.

Whereas 39 years ago, on March 29, 1973, the last 2,500 troops were withdrawn 
        from South Vietnam thus ending military involvement in what is now the 
        longest war in United States history;
Whereas 38 years ago, on March 29, 1974, was declared Vietnam Veterans Day by 
        Presidential order with the support of Congress;
Whereas the 58,195 honorable and brave souls who fought and died during the 
        Vietnam War, ones who are missing, and those who died since from the 
        consequences of that war, deserve the eternal gratitude and respect of 
        this Nation;
Whereas March 29, 2012, was declared Vietnam Veterans Day by Presidential 
        Proclamation with the support of Congress on the eve of the 50th 
        anniversary commemoration of the beginning of the Vietnam War;
Whereas the men and women who served with dedication, honor, and pride during 
        the Vietnam War, both in country and in support of those in harm's way 
        as well as those protecting our freedoms at home and throughout other 
        parts of the world at that time, deserve the eternal gratitude and 
        respect of this Nation;
Whereas the families whose loved ones gave their lives for our country during 
        the Vietnam War, deserve the eternal gratitude and respect of this 
        Nation;
Whereas the families of those men and women who came home with the physical and 
        emotional wounds of the Vietnam War and committed to a lifetime of care 
        and support for their loved one, deserve the eternal gratitude and 
        respect of this Nation;
Whereas the fellow citizens who stood by and supported the families of the 
        fallen as well as the Vietnam veterans who returned and their families, 
        without reservation and with loving care and respect, deserve the 
        eternal gratitude and respect of this Nation;
Whereas those professionals and volunteers who committed themselves to the 
        loving care and healing of the bodily and emotionally wounded from the 
        Vietnam War at home and have already the utmost gratitude of those they 
        cared for and of their families, deserve the eternal gratitude and 
        respect of this Nation;
Whereas the men and women of the allies who served with dedication, honor, and 
        pride alongside the Nation's defenders during the Vietnam War, both in 
        country and in support of those in harm's way as well as those 
        protecting our freedoms and throughout other parts of the world at that 
        time, deserve the eternal gratitude and respect of this Nation;
Whereas this expression of gratitude and respect to the Vietnam Veterans and 
        their families will also give hope and assurance, to current and future 
        generations of the Nation's defenders and their respective families, 
        that their sacrifice and service will not be forgotten and deserving of 
        a distinct recognition of the eternal gratitude and respect of this 
        Nation;
Whereas this expression of gratitude and respect for the honorable sacrifice and 
        service by the Vietnam Veterans, past as well as current and future 
        generations of the Nation's defenders and their respective families, 
        needs to remain in the hearts and thoughts of fellow citizens forever, 
        passed on from generation to generation; and
Whereas numerous States have already chosen March 29 as Vietnam Veterans Day by 
        legislation and many more States have joined with individual events to 
        honor and thank these brave Veterans and their families for their 
        service to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of Vietnam Veterans Day.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
