                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the establishment and full funding of a staff exchange 
  program between the House of Representatives and the Parliament of 
           Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada, as soon as possible.

Whereas supporters of democracy worldwide recognize the valor of the people of 
        Ukraine in seeking to advance democratic governance in their country;
Whereas the role of the Parliament of Ukraine, the Verkhovna Rada, is essential 
        to ensuring democratic governance and a balance of power among the 
        branches of the Government of Ukraine;
Whereas the people of the United States affirm the positive role being played by 
        the Parliament of Ukraine in averting a constitutional crisis in that 
        transitional republic;
Whereas, on November 30, 1999, the Speaker of the House of Representatives 
        signed an agreement with the leaders of the Parliament of Ukraine to 
        establish an interparliamentary exchange program between the two 
        legislative bodies;
Whereas Members of the House of Representatives and the Parliament of Ukraine 
        have already participated in video teleconferences as part of this 
        agreement; and
Whereas the House of Representatives has commended these historic efforts and 
        expressed its desire and willingness to build on the success of this 
        agreement: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
establishment and full funding of a staff exchange program between the 
House of Representatives and the Parliament of Ukraine, the Verkhovna 
Rada, as soon as possible.
