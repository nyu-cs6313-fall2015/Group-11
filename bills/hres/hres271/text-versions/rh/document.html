disposition of the amendments en bloc.
    Sec. 4.  At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for 
amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House 
with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a 
separate vote in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of 
the Whole to the bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute
