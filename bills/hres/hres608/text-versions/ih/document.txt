        University of California, Santa Barbara;
Whereas the people of the United States offer support to all the victims and 
        their families, and wish the 13 injured full and speedy recoveries;
Whereas the brave response of law enforcement officials and other first

        difficult for the Isla Vista and Santa Barbara communities;
            (4) encourages a productive and thoughtful dialogue on all

            (5) honors the selfless, dedicated service of the law 
        enforcement officials and emergency response personnel who 
        responded to the attack, preventing further loss of life and

            (6) remains committed to working to help prevent tragedies 
        like this from happening again.
