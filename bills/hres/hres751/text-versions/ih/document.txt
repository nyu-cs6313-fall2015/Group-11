                               RESOLUTION


 
      Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a 
 commemorative postage stamp should be issued in honor of the Chinese 
   railroad workers from 1865 to 1869, and that the Citizens' Stamp 
Advisory Committee should recommend to the Postmaster General that such 
                           a stamp be issued.

Whereas the Transcontinental Railroad was one of the most remarkable engineering 
        feats of the 19th century;
Whereas the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad took six years and 
        stretched for nearly 2,000 miles;
Whereas the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad facilitated commerce and 
        reduced cross-country travel times from 6 months to a single week after 
        being completed;
Whereas the 150th anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad 
        will take place on May 10, 2019;
Whereas nearly 12,000 Chinese immigrants were employed in the construction of 
        the Transcontinental Railroad, comprising more than 80 percent of the 
        workforce of Central Pacific Railroad Company;
Whereas the Chinese railroad workers were considered indispensable by their 
        foremen and were respected for their work ethic and discipline;
Whereas the Chinese railroad workers set a world record by laying 10 miles of 
        railroad track in just one work day;
Whereas the Chinese railroad workers were given the most difficult, dangerous 
        jobs and were paid lower wages than other railroad workers;
Whereas nearly 1,200 Chinese railroad workers died from work accidents, 
        avalanches, and explosions while working in the Sierra Nevada Mountains;
Whereas the Department of Labor has inducted the Chinese railroad workers into 
        the Labor Hall of Honor for their courage in organizing in pursuit of 
        fair wages and safe working conditions;
Whereas the Chinese railroad workers set an example for the millions of Asian 
        Americans who came to the United States after them through their fight 
        against discrimination;
Whereas both the descendants of these workers and the wider Asian-American 
        community view the sacrifices of the Chinese railroad workers as being 
        integral to the creation of the vibrant and growing Asian-American 
        community that exists throughout the country today; and
Whereas the Chinese railroad workers continue to have a profound, positive 
        impact on the American way of life by advancing the ideals of equal 
        opportunity and the dignity of work for everyone: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued by the 
        United States Postal Service honoring the Chinese railroad 
        workers; and
            (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend 
        to the Postmaster General that such a postage stamp be issued.
