                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of May 23 as the ``International Day to 
End Obstetric Fistula'' to significantly raise awareness and intensify 
               actions towards ending obstetric fistula.

Whereas the United Nations has designated May 23 as the ``International Day to 
        End Obstetric Fistula'';
Whereas obstetric fistula is a catastrophic childbirth injury which arises as a 
        complication of obstructed labor;
Whereas an estimated 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 women currently are afflicted by the 
        devastating physical and social effects of obstetric fistula, a scourge 
        of epidemic proportions;
Whereas as many as 50,000 to 100,000 new cases occur each year;
Whereas historically, obstetric fistula affected women in the United States and 
        around the world and advances in obstetric care and access to improved 
        surgical techniques resulted in a drastic reduction in obstetric fistula 
        by the early 20th century in the United States;
Whereas today, obstetric fistula primarily affects the poorest women in the 
        poorest parts of the world;
Whereas obstetric fistula disproportionately affects women in sub-Saharan Africa 
        and Asia and girls, some as young as 13 years old, who are subjected to 
        child marriage and whose bodies are not fully capable of handling the 
        demands of childbirth;
Whereas obstetric fistula, which usually results in fetal death by asphyxia, 
        occurs when the tissues that normally separate a woman's vagina from her 
        bladder or rectum are destroyed by lack of oxygenated blood getting to 
        the tissue in the pelvic floor and prolonged pressure from the fetal 
        head trapped in the birth canal;
Whereas obstetric fistula typically occurs because a woman does not have access 
        to emergency obstetric care or because she does not have the financial 
        means, transportation, or access to surgical repair;
Whereas left untreated, an obstetric fistula afflicts a woman with devastating 
        physical conditions, including incontinence, painful ulcers, and 
        constant and uncontrollable emission of offensive odors;
Whereas these symptoms leave a woman indelibly and perpetually stigmatized by 
        her condition;
Whereas because obstetric fistula does not heal on its own, women affected by 
        this condition are marginalized for the remainder of their lives;
Whereas expelled from their communities and denied education and health care, 
        obstetric fistula victims are left in desperate economic circumstances;
Whereas victims also suffer social ostracism that results in involuntary 
        divorce, exclusion from religious activities, deepening poverty, 
        malnutrition, deteriorating physical health, depression, and despair;
Whereas as a result, victims are left defenseless and vulnerable;
Whereas this social isolation compounds already existing problems such as 
        illiteracy and lack of economic opportunities;
Whereas because obstetric fistula are not themselves fatal, millions of women 
        live with this horrific condition and have been overlooked by the 
        international medical community;
Whereas obstetric fistula can be prevented when women and their families are 
        educated about the birthing process and are provided access to emergency 
        obstetric care;
Whereas today, doctors can surgically repair obstetric fistula with a low-cost, 
        low-technology surgery;
Whereas the impact of an obstetric fistula-repair surgery is immediate and 
        consequential;
Whereas women can be re-integrated into society and are afforded basic human 
        necessities such as familial relationships, health care, and the 
        opportunity to earn a living;
Whereas the prevention, treatment, and ultimately the eradication of obstetric 
        fistula will advance the emancipation and empowerment of women, 
        strengthen families and communities, and improve the overall economic, 
        educational, and social well-being of affected societies;
Whereas basic interventions to identify and repair obstetric fistula have 
        achieved meaningful and cost-effective results; and
Whereas the nature of obstetric fistula, and the fact that it affects vulnerable 
        women in poor and isolated communities which offer little or no access 
        to obstetric care, demands a comprehensive, coordinated, long-term, 
        international response focused on the prevention and treatment of 
        obstetric fistula: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the goals and 
ideals of the ``International Day to End Obstetric Fistula'' to 
significantly raise awareness and intensify actions towards ending 
obstetric fistula.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
