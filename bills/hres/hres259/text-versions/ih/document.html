 Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Ghadar Party 
                         in the United States.

Whereas Indian nationals started coming to the United States for higher 
        education and economic opportunities in the beginning of the 20th 
        century;
Whereas there are an estimated 3,000,000 people of Indian origin in the United 
        States forming an integral part of the social fabric of the Nation;
Whereas Indian nationals were inspired by the success of the American Revolution 
        against Great Britain;
Whereas in 1913, Indians nationals formed the Hindustani Association of the 
        Pacific Coast in Astoria, Oregon, popularly known as the Ghadar Party 
        with a major objective of liberating India from British colonialism;
Whereas the Ghadar Party established its headquarters in San Francisco, 
        California;
Whereas the Ghadar Party launched a magazine titled ``Ghadar'' to promote aims, 
        objectives, and activities of the organization and published over 5,000 
        copies weekly for circulation;
Whereas thousands of Ghadar supporters living in the United States and Canada 
        returned to India and inspired their countrymen to fight for their 
        independence from Great Britain, which was achieved in 1947;
Whereas hundreds of Ghadarites fought and died for the freedom of their home 
        country; and
Whereas 2013 is the 100th anniversary of the formation of this historic Ghadar 
        Party that recognizes the universal right of sovereign nations to 
        independence and self-rule: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the 100th 
anniversary of the founding of the Ghadar Party in the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
