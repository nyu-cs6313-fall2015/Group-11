                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing June 19, 2014, as this year's observance of the historical 
              significance of Juneteenth Independence Day.

Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier areas of the United 
        States, and in particular the Southwestern States, for more than 2\1/2\ 
        years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which was 
        issued on January 1, 1863, and months after the conclusion of the Civil 
        War;
Whereas on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major General Gordon Granger 
        arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and 
        that the enslaved were free;
Whereas African-Americans who had been slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 
        19th, commonly known as ``Juneteenth Independence Day'', as the 
        anniversary of their emancipation;
Whereas African-Americans from the Southwest continue the tradition of 
        celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as inspiration and encouragement 
        for future generations;
Whereas for more than 145 years, Juneteenth Independence Day celebrations have 
        been held to honor African-American freedom while encouraging self-
        development and respect for all cultures; and
Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by former slaves 
        remains an example for all people of the United States, regardless of 
        background, religion, or race: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the House of Representatives--
                    (A) recognizes the historical significance of 
                Juneteenth Independence Day to the Nation;
                    (B) supports the continued celebration of 
                Juneteenth Independence Day to provide an opportunity 
                for the people of the United States to learn more about 
                the past and to better understand the experiences that 
                have shaped the Nation; and
                    (C) encourages the people of the United States to 
                observe Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate 
                ceremonies, activities, and programs; and
            (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
                    (A) the celebration of the end of slavery is an 
                important and enriching part of the history and 
                heritage of the United States; and
                    (B) history should be regarded as a means for 
                understanding the past and solving the challenges of 
                the future.
                                 <all>
