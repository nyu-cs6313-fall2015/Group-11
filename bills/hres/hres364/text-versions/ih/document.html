    Supporting the goals and ideals of ``World Alzheimer's Month''.

Whereas Alzheimer's is a progressive neurological disease that impairs an 
        individual's memory, cognitive abilities, and behavior;
Whereas Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia;
Whereas approximately 35,600,000 individuals cope with dementia worldwide, with 
        more than 5,000,000 living with Alzheimer's in the United States;
Whereas neurological research continues to lead to advances in the treatment and 
        diagnosis of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia; and
Whereas ``World Alzheimer's Month'' is recognized in September and serves to 
        increase awareness about the disease, its impact on the lives of those 
        affected by it, and the efforts of those seeking to cure Alzheimer's: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``World Alzheimer's 
        Month'';
            (2) acknowledges the impact Alzheimer's has on the lives of 
        individuals worldwide and in the United States; and
            (3) acknowledges the progress and improvements neurological 
        research has made in the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's 
        and other forms of dementia.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
