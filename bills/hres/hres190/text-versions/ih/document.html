                               RESOLUTION


 
   Condemning the April 15, 2013, Improvised Explosive Device (IED) 
  attacks in Boston, Massachusetts and calling upon the United States 
  Government, the governments of all nations, the United Nations, and 
other international organizations to renounce the use of IEDs and take 
                  actions to stop their proliferation.

Whereas on April 15, 2013, innocent civilians were maliciously victimized by 
        Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in a terrorist attack in Boston, 
        Massachusetts;
Whereas the IED has become a very effective weapon for those who advance their 
        cause through terror and violence, as exemplified by the fact that an 
        average of 500 IED incidents occur in the world each day, excluding 
        incidents occurring in Iraq or Afghanistan, and that an average of 12 
        such incidents occur each day in both Iraq and Afghanistan;
Whereas IED attacks are the leading cause of casualties for American 
        servicemembers and are anticipated to remain the leading cause of such 
        casualties for the foreseeable future;
Whereas the Global Campaign Against IEDs, as a responsible international entity 
        for action against IEDs and for supporting IED victims, has found that 
        IED attacks are the leading cause of the most prevalent injuries to 
        veterans, including vision and hearing loss, spinal cord injuries, 
        traumatic brain injury, amputations, genitourinary injuries, and post-
        traumatic stress disorder;
Whereas the Blinded Veterans Association and AMVETS have found that the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs currently treats 198,670 veterans for 
        hearing injuries and 118,150 veterans for eye injuries, numbers that are 
        expected to increase significantly as active duty servicemembers enter 
        the Veterans Affairs system;
Whereas people who live in areas affected by IED incidents live in constant fear 
        of additional attacks that disrupt everything from daily routines to 
        health care to elections, and these disruptions, together with the 
        displacement, destruction, and loss of personal assets caused by IED 
        incidents, severely degrade the ability of these people to sustain their 
        livelihoods;
Whereas reducing the use of IEDs and neutralizing the networks that produce them 
        requires a holistic approach to identify and eliminate the root causes 
        that allow such networks to form and survive;
Whereas IEDs kill scores of innocent civilians, including women and children; 
        and
Whereas resolving the IED problem is the global community's responsibility: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) unequivocally condemns the use of Improvised Explosive 
        Devices (IEDs) and calls for the full prosecution of those 
        responsible for the IED terrorist attack in Boston, 
        Massachusetts on April 15, 2013;
            (2) expresses its condolences to the families of those who 
        were killed in the IED terrorist attack in Boston, 
        Massachusetts on April 15, 2013, and its support for those who 
        were injured as well as their families;
            (3) expresses unwavering support for the active duty 
        servicemembers, first responders, and explosive ordnance 
        disposal personnel of the United States who face the threat of 
        IEDs and put their lives on the line to defeat them;
            (4) calls on all relevant agencies of the United States 
        Government to coordinate with international partners and other 
        responsible entities to reduce the use of IEDs and curb their 
        proliferation;
            (5) urges the governments of all nations, as well as the 
        United Nations and other international organizations, to 
        formally renounce the use of IEDs through an international 
        resolution and to assist all partners and responsible entities 
        in securing and monitoring the manufacture, sale, 
        transportation, and use of IED components and techniques;
            (6) calls on all relevant agencies of the United States 
        Government to support the care of active duty servicemembers, 
        veterans, and first responders who are victims of IEDs by 
        facilitating the exchange of blast trauma research data among 
        law enforcement agencies, the Department of Defense, the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs, congressionally chartered 
        veterans service organizations, and other responsible entities; 
        and
            (7) calls on the United States Government to support 
        international action against IEDs and those who traffic in IED 
        components and techniques, and to support IED victims by 
        sharing IED-related event data and information with responsible 
        entities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
