		<whereas><text>Whereas President Obama and officials in his administration have frequently overstepped the limits
			 placed on executive branch power by the Constitution;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas President Obama stated he did not have the legal authority to take executive actions on
			 immigration that he has now subsequently taken;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas because of President Obama’s continuing failure to faithfully execute the laws, his
			 administration’s actions cannot be addressed by the enactment of new laws,
			 because Congress cannot assume that the President will execute the new
			 laws any more faithfully than the laws he has already ignored, leaving
			 Congress with no legislative remedy to prevent the establishment of what
			 is in effect an imperial Presidency; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas it is therefore necessary and appropriate for Congress to turn to the courts to ensure the
			 faithful execution of the laws as required by the Constitution: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
