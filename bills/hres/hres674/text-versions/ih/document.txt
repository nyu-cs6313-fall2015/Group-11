                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that sedentary 
lifestyles are a public health issue and supporting the designation of 
 a National Get Vertical Day to recognize the importance of preventing 
 physical inactivity and encouraging adults to live physically active 
                              lifestyles.

Whereas the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically over the last 25 
        years;
Whereas over one-third of adults in the United States are obese, and ethnic and 
        racial minorities face disproportionately high obesity and diabetes 
        rates;
Whereas over 27 percent of all Americans 17 to 24 years of age (over 9,000,000 
        young men and women) are too heavy to join the military;
Whereas only 22 percent of Americans report regular, sustained physical activity 
        and only 5 percent of adults achieve the recommended 150 minutes per 
        week of moderate to vigorous physical activity;
Whereas sedentary lifestyles burden our economy and health care system, costing 
        up to $24,000,000,000 in direct medical spending;
Whereas sedentary lifestyles increase the likelihood of chronic diseases, 
        including diabetes, which accounts for more than $98,000,000,000 in 
        direct and indirect medical costs and lost productivity each year;
Whereas it is estimated that physical inactivity is responsible for 1 in 10 
        deaths each year;
Whereas many chronic diseases stemming from physical inactivity, including 
        diabetes, are preventable and controllable through a number of modest 
        lifestyle changes, including standing up or employing alternative 
        physical movement for 5 minutes every hour in the workplace;
Whereas the relevance of obesity and physical inactivity is much higher in 
        people with disabilities than people without disabilities;
Whereas walking 10,000 steps a day leads to a 90-percent reduction in heart 
        attacks, a 30- to 70-percent reduction in cancer rates, a 50-percent 
        reduction in type 2 diabetes, and a 70-percent reduction in the rate of 
        strokes; and
Whereas the short- and long-term costs of reduced productivity, health care 
        expenses, and negative health outcomes create the imperative for 
        increased physical movement in the workplace: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of a National Get Vertical 
        Day;
            (2) encourages employers and employees to acknowledge the 
        goals and ideals of a National Get Vertical Day by 
        incorporating physical movement and appropriate programming 
        into daily work activity; and
            (3) recognizes the serious long-term effects of sedentary 
        lifestyles on the health of our Nation and urges continued 
        coordination and cooperation between the Federal Government, 
        State and local governments, employers, community 
        organizations, and health care providers to promote physical 
        movement and active lifestyles.
                                 <all>
