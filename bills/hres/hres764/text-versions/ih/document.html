    Congratulating Congresswomen Frederica S. Wilson and Ileana Ros-
 Lehtinen on their induction into the Miami-Dade County Public Schools 
                             Hall of Fame.

Whereas Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen 
        will be inducted into the Miami-Dade County Public Schools (MDCPS) Hall 
        of Fame on Friday, November 21, 2014;
Whereas Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen's journey with Miami-Dade County Public 
        Schools began at the age of 8, when her family arrived in South Florida 
        after fleeing Cuba's communist regime, and she attended Southside 
        Elementary School in Little Havana, West Miami Junior High School, and 
        Southwest High School, and then went on to earn an Associate of Arts 
        Degree from Miami-Dade Community College, Bachelors and Masters Degrees 
        in Education from Florida International University, and a Doctorate in 
        Education from the University of Miami;
Whereas empowered by the quality of education she received from MDCPS, 
        Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen became a Florida certified teacher, and while 
        serving as an educator, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen was inspired to find 
        solutions to the many challenges facing her students and their families, 
        and subsequently ran for office to continue to tackle the challenges 
        impacting South Floridians;
Whereas Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen's legislative accomplishments include the 
        creation of the Florida Prepaid College Program, which has helped send 
        millions of Florida students to college, and she has also advocated for 
        human rights around the world and worked to improve South Florida's 
        economy and create jobs;
Whereas Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen is the first Hispanic woman to serve in the 
        Florida Legislature, the first Hispanic woman to serve in Congress, the 
        first Cuban-American elected to Congress, and the first Hispanic to 
        chair the prestigious Committee on Foreign Affairs;
Whereas Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen is happily married to the love of her life, 
        Dexter Lehtinen, and is a proud mother, stepmother, and grandmother;
Whereas Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson began her journey with MDCPS at 
        Liberty City Elementary School, and she went on to attend D.A. Dorsey 
        Junior High School and Miami Northwestern Senior High School, and then 
        went on to earn a Bachelors of Science Degree in Elementary Education 
        from Fisk University and a Masters of Science Degree in Elementary 
        Education from the University of Miami;
Whereas Congresswoman Wilson found her calling while working as an educator for 
        MDCPS, where she served as a teacher and assistant educational 
        coordinator for Head Start, and later as Assistant Principal and 
        Principal of Skyway Elementary School;
Whereas while serving as Principal of Skyway Elementary School, Congresswoman 
        Wilson became inspired to close the achievement gap faced by young black 
        males of color, and, as a single mother with little disposable income, 
        founded the then-500 Role Models of Excellence Project, quit her job, 
        and ran for the Miami-Dade School Board with the single mission of 
        ensuring educational equity for boys and men of color;
Whereas with the support of her friends, family, and the South Florida 
        community, the 500 Role Models has grown into the 5000 Roles Models of 
        Excellence Project, and through this program, Congresswoman Wilson has 
        helped thousands of young men of color to thrive in school, avert the 
        school-to-prison pipeline, pursue higher education, access the American 
        Dream, and become great husbands, fathers, and citizens, as since its 
        inception, 5000 Role Models has awarded more than $10 million in college 
        scholarships and currently operates in over 110 Miami-Dade County public 
        schools, serving more than 8,000 young men;
Whereas in addition to the iconic 5000 Role Models of Excellence Project, 
        Congresswoman Wilson's achievements include a decade of outstanding 
        service in the Florida Legislature, as a Representative and Senator, 
        where she achieved a series of feats including working with Republican 
        Governor Jeb Bush to remove the Confederate flag from the State Capitol, 
        mandating HIV/AIDS testing for newly released prisoners, opposing high-
        stakes standardized testing, pushing for a ban of the term ``illegal 
        alien'' in State public records, and partnering with Republican Governor 
        Charlie Crist to restore voting rights for ex-felons;
Whereas since 2010, Congresswoman Wilson has represented Florida's 24th 
        Congressional District in Congress, where she has transcended 
        partisanship to strengthen ladders of opportunity and provide a voice to 
        the voiceless, and has secured more than $1 billion in Federal 
        investment for her district, led bipartisan coalitions on jobs and 
        ports, and been an advocate for freedom and justice worldwide; and
Whereas Congresswoman Wilson is widowed and is the proud mother of 3 children, 
        Nicole, Kesha, and Paul, and grandmother of 5 beautiful grandchildren: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates both Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson 
        and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen on their induction into 
        the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Hall of Fame; and
            (2) commends Congresswoman Frederica S. Wilson and 
        Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for their outstanding service 
        to our Nation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
