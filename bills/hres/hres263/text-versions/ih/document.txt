                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the immeasurable contributions of fathers in the healthy 
    development of children, supporting responsible fatherhood, and 
   encouraging greater involvement of fathers in the lives of their 
                 children, especially on Father's Day.

Whereas fathers factor significantly in the lives of children;
Whereas fathers play an important role in teaching their children life lessons 
        and preparing them to succeed in school and in life;
Whereas children with involved fathers are more likely to do well in school, 
        have a better sense of well-being, and have fewer behavioral problems;
Whereas supportive fathers promote the positive physical, social, emotional, 
        moral, and mental development of children;
Whereas promoting responsible fatherhood can help increase the chances that 
        children will grow up with two caring parents;
Whereas, when fathers are actively involved in the upbringing of children, the 
        children demonstrate greater self-control and a greater ability to take 
        initiative;
Whereas responsible fatherhood can help reduce child poverty;
Whereas responsible fatherhood strengthens families and communities; and
Whereas Father's Day is the third Sunday in June: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the millions of fathers who serve as a 
        wonderful, caring parent for their children;
            (2) calls on fathers across the United States to use 
        Father's Day to reconnect and rededicate themselves to their 
        children's lives, to spend Father's Day with their children, 
        and to express their love and support for their children;
            (3) urges men to understand the level of responsibility 
        fathering a child requires, especially in the encouragement of 
        the mental, moral, social, academic, emotional, physical, and 
        spiritual development of children; and
            (4) encourages active involvement of fathers in the rearing 
        and development of their children, including the devotion of 
        time, energy, and resources.
