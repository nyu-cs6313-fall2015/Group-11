      Providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2609) making 
 appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies 
 for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other purposes.

    Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this resolution 
the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the 
House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of 
the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 2609) making 
appropriations for energy and water development and related agencies 
for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2014, and for other purposes. 
The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate 
shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Appropriations. After general debate the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. Points of order 
against provisions in the bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of 
rule XXI are waived. During consideration of the bill for amendment, 
the chair of the Committee of the Whole may accord priority in 
recognition on the basis of whether the Member offering an amendment 
has caused it to be printed in the portion of the Congressional Record 
designated for that purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII. Amendments so 
printed shall be considered as read. When the committee rises and 
reports the bill back to the House with a recommendation that the bill 
do pass, the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the 
bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion 
except one motion to recommit with or without instructions.
