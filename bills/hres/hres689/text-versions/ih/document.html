                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting an end to the ethnic and politically fueled violence in 
    South Sudan and the successful implementation of a transitional 
                              government.

Whereas the United States played a key role in brokering the 2005 Comprehensive 
        Peace Agreement that ended the civil war of nearly 40 years, and 
        resulted in South Sudan's decision by referendum in January 2011 to 
        secede from Sudan;
Whereas emerging as the world's newest country on July 9, 2011, South Sudan 
        possessed considerable energy resources but had almost no infrastructure 
        or civilian governmental institutions and was challenged by 300,000 
        internally displaced people, half its population struggling below the 
        poverty line, and a GDP per capita of $1,000, according to the World 
        Bank;
Whereas, on December 15, 2013, growing political tensions between South Sudanese 
        President Salva Kiir of the Dinka ethnic group and Vice President Riek 
        Machar of the Nuer ethnic group erupted in violence in the capital of 
        Juba and spread to other parts of the country, particularly the eastern 
        state of Jonglei and the oil-producing states of Unity and Upper Nile;
Whereas what began as a political power struggle became a widespread ethnic 
        battle that tore apart the Sudan People's Liberation Movement as well as 
        the cabinet and threatened ethnic violence across the country;
Whereas President Kiir and former Vice President Machar have signed three 
        separate peace agreements, including one on June 10, 2014, to form a 
        transitional government within 60 days;
Whereas according to the United Nations, since mid-December 2013, thousands of 
        South Sudanese have been killed including those targeted for their 
        ethnicity, 1,500,000 people have been displaced, 7,000,000 people risk 
        hunger and disease, approximately 4,000,000 people face severe food 
        insecurity, and 50,000 children could die from malnutrition if aid 
        agencies' assistance and access does not increase;
Whereas in December 2013, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) 
        dispatched a ministerial delegation, consisting of Ministers and high 
        level officials from Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and 
        Uganda and the African Union Commissioner for Peace and Security, to 
        Juba to help diffuse the tension in South Sudan and mediate a peaceful 
        political settlement, and in early June 2014, initiated peace talks in 
        Addis Ababa that included civil society organizations, religious groups, 
        political parties, and formerly detained political leaders in a multi-
        stakeholders symposium;
Whereas the United States has been the largest bilateral foreign aid donor to 
        South Sudan, obligating more than $268,000,000 in humanitarian 
        assistance in fiscal year 2013 and $394,000,000 in fiscal year 2014 to 
        date; and
Whereas Ambassador Susan Page re-declared a disaster in South Sudan in October 
        2013, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has 
        stated that insecurity, landmines, and limited transportation and 
        communication infrastructure have restricted humanitarian activities 
        across South Sudan, hindering the delivery of critical assistance to 
        populations in need: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses its strong support for the people of South 
        Sudan and the region;
            (2) condemns the targeted attacks on civilians, often along 
        ethnic lines and in hospital or school settings, and on 
        civilian humanitarian assistance workers, and insists that all 
        armed groups cease all violence against civilians in compliance 
        with international law;
            (3) stresses the need for unfettered access throughout 
        South Sudan for humanitarian aid;
            (4) urges the President to work with the international 
        community to provide technical support to the African Union 
        Commission of Inquiry into grave human rights abuses and to 
        consider the creation of a mixed or hybrid tribunal to ensure 
        those responsible for civilian attacks and grave human rights 
        abuses are held accountable;
            (5) emphasizes the need for the Government of South Sudan 
        and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement in Opposition to 
        implement in good faith the cessation of hostilities agreement 
        signed January 23, 2014;
            (6) encourages the Government of South Sudan to implement 
        in good faith the agreement from June 10, 2014, to create a 
        transitional government within 60 days and engage in meaningful 
        dialogue with rebel forces, women, and civil society 
        representatives;
            (7) urges the President to sustain high-level engagement 
        and apply continued pressure on both the Government of South 
        Sudan and rebel forces; and
            (8) strongly supports efforts by the Intergovernmental 
        Authority on Development to mediate the conflict and monitor 
        violations of the cessation of hostilities agreement and 
        leverage their influence to find a sustainable resolution to 
        the current conflict.
