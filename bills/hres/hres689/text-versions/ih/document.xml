	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas the United States played a key role in brokering the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement
			 that ended the civil war of nearly 40 years, and resulted in South Sudan’s
			 decision by referendum in January 2011 to secede from Sudan;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas emerging as the world’s newest country on July 9, 2011, South Sudan possessed considerable
			 energy resources but had almost no infrastructure or civilian governmental
			 institutions and was challenged by 300,000 internally displaced people,
			 half its population struggling below the poverty line, and a GDP per
			 capita of $1,000, according to the World Bank;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on December 15, 2013, growing political tensions between South Sudanese President Salva
			 Kiir of the Dinka ethnic group and Vice President Riek Machar of the Nuer
			 ethnic group erupted in violence in the capital of Juba and spread to
			 other parts of the country, particularly the eastern state of Jonglei and
			 the oil-producing states of Unity and Upper Nile;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas what began as a political power struggle became a widespread ethnic battle that tore apart
			 the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement as well as the cabinet and
			 threatened ethnic violence across the country;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas President Kiir and former Vice President Machar have signed three separate peace
			 agreements, including one on June 10, 2014, to form a transitional
			 government within 60 days;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to the United Nations, since mid-December 2013, thousands of South Sudanese have
			 been killed including those targeted for their ethnicity, 1,500,000 people
			 have been displaced, 7,000,000 people risk hunger and disease,
			 approximately 4,000,000 people face severe food insecurity, and 50,000
			 children could die from malnutrition if aid agencies’ assistance and
			 access does not increase;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in December 2013, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) dispatched a
			 ministerial delegation, consisting of Ministers and high level officials
			 from Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda and the African
			 Union Commissioner for Peace and Security, to Juba to help diffuse the
			 tension in South Sudan and mediate a peaceful political settlement, and in
			 early June 2014, initiated peace talks in Addis Ababa that included civil
			 society organizations, religious groups, political parties, and formerly
			 detained political leaders in a multi-stakeholders symposium;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States has been the largest bilateral foreign aid donor to South Sudan,
			 obligating more than $268,000,000 in humanitarian assistance in fiscal
			 year 2013 and $394,000,000 in fiscal year 2014 to date; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Ambassador Susan Page re-declared a disaster in South Sudan in October 2013, and the U.S.
			 Agency for International Development (USAID) has stated that insecurity,
			 landmines, and limited transportation and communication infrastructure
			 have restricted humanitarian activities across South Sudan, hindering the
			 delivery of critical assistance to populations in need: Now, therefore, be
			 it</text></whereas></preamble>
