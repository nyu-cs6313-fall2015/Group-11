                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans 
                                 Day''.

Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in Vietnam from 1961 to 1975, and involved 
        North Vietnam and the Viet Cong in conflict with the United States Armed 
        Forces and South Vietnam;
Whereas the United States became involved in Vietnam because policymakers in the 
        United States believed that if South Vietnam fell to a Communist 
        government then Communism would spread throughout the rest of Southeast 
        Asia;
Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces began serving in an advisory 
        role to the South Vietnamese in 1961;
Whereas as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on August 2, 1964, and 
        August 4, 1964, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf of Tonkin 
        Resolution, on August 7, 1964, which effectively handed over war-making 
        powers to President Johnson until such time as ``peace and security'' 
        had returned to Vietnam;
Whereas in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat units arrived in 
        Vietnam;
Whereas by the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United States troops in Vietnam, 
        and by 1969 a peak of approximately 543,000 troops was reached;
Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which required the 
        release of all United States prisoners-of-war held in North Vietnam and 
        the withdrawal of all United States Armed Forces from South Vietnam;
Whereas, on March 30, 1973, the United States Armed Forces completed the 
        withdrawal of combat troops from Vietnam;
Whereas more than 58,000 members of the United States Armed Forces lost their 
        lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 members of the Armed Forces were 
        wounded;
Whereas in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated in the District of 
        Columbia to commemorate those members of the United States Armed Forces 
        who died or were declared missing-in-action in Vietnam;
Whereas the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue among the people of the 
        United States;
Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces who served bravely and 
        faithfully for the United States during the Vietnam War were caught upon 
        their return home in the crossfire of public debate about the 
        involvement of the United States in the Vietnam War;
Whereas the establishment of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'' would be an 
        appropriate way to honor those members of the United States Armed Forces 
        who served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War; and
Whereas March 30, 2014, would be an appropriate day to establish as ``Welcome 
        Home Vietnam Veterans Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Welcome Home Vietnam 
        Veterans Day'';
            (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of veterans of 
        the Armed Forces who served in Vietnam; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'' with appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities that promote awareness of the 
        contributions of veterans who served in Vietnam and the 
        importance of helping Vietnam era veterans re-adjust to 
        civilian life.
