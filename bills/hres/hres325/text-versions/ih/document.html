                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President 
  should award the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously to Glen 
 Doherty and Tyrone Woods, both of whom died from enemy action during 
the attack on United States facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on the night 
                       of September 11-12, 2012.

Whereas on September 11, 2012, United States facilities and personnel in 
        Benghazi, Libya, were attacked by militants with ties to Islamist 
        terrorist groups;
Whereas four Americans were killed in the attack: Ambassador J. Christopher 
        Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods;
Whereas Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were former Navy SEALs serving as security 
        personnel in Libya who, as the attack unfolded, fought valiently to 
        defend American property and protect United States personnel;
Whereas their small security team was thrown into action in the face of enemies 
        who were better armed with heavier weapons and who greatly outnumbered 
        the Americans, and in ensuing combat, Woods and Doherty sacrificed their 
        own lives in the effort to save the lives of others;
Whereas according to Executive Order 1086, signed by President John F. Kennedy 
        on February 22, 1963, the first listed criterion for the award of the 
        Medal of Freedom by the President is to ``any person who has made an 
        especially meritorious contribution to . . . the security or national 
        interests of the United States'', which is a description that clearly 
        fits both Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the President should award the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
posthumously to Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods for their selfless 
dedication, courage, and sacrifice during the battle in Benghazi, 
Libya, during the night of September 11-12, 2012.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
