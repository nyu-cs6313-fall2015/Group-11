                               RESOLUTION


 
Urging the Federal Aviation Administration to continue its cooperation 
   with airports across the United States seeking to implement noise 
               mitigation plans, and for other purposes.

Whereas the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a long history of 
        collaborating with Federal, State, and local officials in efforts to 
        implement noise mitigation plans;
Whereas significant noise pollution can have adverse impacts on education, 
        commerce, quality of life, sleep patterns, and home values;
Whereas the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is successfully 
        reducing noise pollution at airports across the United States;
Whereas with the help of the FAA, airports across the United States have 
        established programs to successfully reduce noise pollution, including 
        programs providing for the soundproofing of homes and schools;
Whereas the use of preferential flight tracks, the use of certain arrival and 
        departure procedures, and the use of quieter planes may also mitigate 
        noise pollution;
Whereas airport noise reduction programs must be designed to meet the specific 
        needs and concerns of airports and their surrounding communities; and
Whereas subchapter II of chapter 475 of title 49, United States Code, popularly 
        known as the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, provides a process 
        by which airports may mandate restrictions on airport noise and access 
        with FAA approval: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) urges the Federal Aviation Administration to continue 
        its cooperation with airports across the United States that are 
        seeking to implement noise mitigation plans; and
            (2) encourages the Federal Aviation Administration to 
        continue its implementation of the Next Generation Air 
        Transportation System (NextGen) and other efforts to enhance 
        the safety of air travel and help decrease noise levels.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
