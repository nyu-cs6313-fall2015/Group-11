                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives concerning the 
 need to explore emerging technologies that are mobile and capable of 
supplying high volumes of sterile, pathogenic-free water, and for other 
                               purposes.

Whereas small communities are severely burdened when the Environmental 
        Protection Agency closes their wastewater treatment plants;
Whereas flood waters can disable wastewater and drinking water facilities;
Whereas natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes, can 
        leave entire cities without power and, therefore, without potable water; 
        and
Whereas due to the growing population of the United States, there are more 
        pathogens entering the Nation's water systems: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
in order to respond to situations in which water systems are closed as 
a result of Environmental Protection Agency induced shutdowns or 
natural disasters, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 
Department of Homeland Security should explore emerging technologies 
that are mobile and capable of supplying high volumes of sterile, 
pathogenic-free water.
