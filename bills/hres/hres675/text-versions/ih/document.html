                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the Constitutional authority of the Governors of the States 
of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California to take action to secure 
   the international border of the United States within their States.

Whereas the crisis on the Southwest international border of the United States is 
        of such significance that it demands national attention and urgent 
        action;
Whereas the President, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the 
        Administration have enacted unconstitutional policies, such as the 
        Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the Morton Memos, 
        that have contributed significantly to a massive increase in illegal 
        immigration;
Whereas the President has not secured the Southwest international border of the 
        United States;
Whereas the President has failed to fulfill his Constitutional obligation to 
        protect each State against invasion in accordance with article IV, 
        section 4 of the Constitution;
Whereas States have specific authorities for self-defense under article I, 
        section 10, clause 3 of the Constitution when ``actually invaded, or in 
        such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay'';
Whereas, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, between October 1, 
        2013, and June 15, 2014, 52,193 unaccompanied children were apprehended 
        on the Southwest border;
Whereas, according to a June 3, 2014, Homeland Security Intelligence report, 
        only 0.1 percent of illegal alien, unaccompanied minor children from 
        non-contiguous countries were removed from the United States during 
        fiscal year 2013;
Whereas the Secretary of Homeland Security expects 90,000 unaccompanied alien 
        children to be interdicted by the U.S. Government while crossing the 
        border in fiscal year 2014;
Whereas, according to the Department of Homeland Security, only 20 percent of 
        all persons interdicted are and will be children;
Whereas border security officials estimate the interdiction ratio is 25 percent 
        of those attempting to cross the border;
Whereas according to border security official's testimony before Congress, the 
        likely number of illegal crossing attempts is four times the number of 
        those interdicted;
Whereas the Southern border is not secure, and this border insecurity represents 
        an immediate danger to every citizen of the United States; and
Whereas the Governor of a State is the commander-in-chief of the National Guard 
        of that State: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes, supports, and defends the Constitutional 
        authority of the Governors of the States of Texas, New Mexico, 
        Arizona, and California to deploy units of the National Guard 
        under the jurisdiction of that Governor to secure the 
        international border of the United States within that State;
            (2) urges the Governors of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and 
        California to immediately deploy units of the National Guard 
        forces under their jurisdiction to gain effective control of 
        the southern border of the United States, to prevent anyone 
        without legal immigration status from entering the United 
        States, and to ensure for the people of their States and the 
        United States a safe and free future; and
            (3) commits to appropriating the necessary monies to 
        effectively support any such deployment of units of National 
        Guard.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
