                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for dancing as a form of valuable exercise and 
   artistic expression, and for the designation of July 26, 2014, as 
                          National Dance Day.

Whereas Nigel Lythgoe, executive producer and celebrity judge for the dance-
        themed television show ``So You Think You Can Dance'', in association 
        with the Dizzy Feet Foundation, has encouraged the creation of National 
        Dance Day in nations around the world, beginning with the first National 
        Dance Day on the National Mall in 2010;
Whereas the Dizzy Feet Foundation and the Kennedy Center, in conjunction with 
        the office of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, will celebrate 
        National Dance Day on Saturday, July 26, 2014, in the Nation's Capital 
        at the Kennedy Center;
Whereas National Dance Day has captured the imagination of people throughout the 
        Nation and around the world and has helped popularize dancing as an art, 
        for fun, and as a form of exercise;
Whereas National Dance Day encourages many forms of dance expression, 
        representing the Nation's rich artistic, regional, ethnic, and racial 
        diversity;
Whereas National Dance Day features the spectrum of dance, from classical to 
        popular to line and partner dances;
Whereas dancing helps improve heart health, burn calories, strengthen muscles, 
        and improve flexibility for people of all ages;
Whereas health officials have repeatedly documented an overweight and obesity 
        epidemic among every age group in the United States;
Whereas dancing, in all its variations, is a popular form of physical exercise;
Whereas National Dance Day in the Nation's Capital will begin at 1 p.m. with 
        performances by Dizzy Feet and other local talent; and
Whereas the last Saturday in July continues to be an appropriate day to 
        celebrate National Dance Day as it has been for the past 3 years: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of National Dance Day to 
        celebrate and encourage the national commitment to dance 
        education and physical fitness;
            (2) acknowledges that dance is making an important 
        contribution to health by encouraging physical fitness and 
        reducing overweight and obesity; and
            (3) commends Nigel Lythgoe for his leadership in promoting 
        National Dance Day.
