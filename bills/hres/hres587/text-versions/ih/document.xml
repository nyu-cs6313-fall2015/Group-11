	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas May 19, 2014, marks the 5-year anniversary of the end of the 26-year conflict between the
			 terrorist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and the Government of
			 Sri Lanka;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the people of Sri Lanka suffered greatly as a result of this conflict, the impact and
			 aftermath of which has been felt especially by women, children, and
			 families;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka established a Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission
			 (LLRC) to recommend measures to prevent the recurrence of conflict in the
			 future and promote further national unity and reconciliation among all
			 communities;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the LLRC report acknowledges important events and grievances that contributed to decades of
			 political violence and civil war in Sri Lanka and makes constructive
			 recommendations on a wide range of issues, including the need to credibly
			 investigate widespread allegations of extrajudicial killings and enforced
			 disappearances, demilitarize the north and the country as a whole, reach a
			 political settlement with minority communities on the meaningful
			 devolution of power, promote and protect the right to freedom of
			 expression for all, including the enactment of a right to information
			 law,;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas and enact rule of law reforms;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas implementation of the LLRC report’s recommendations would contribute to the process of
			 national reconciliation in Sri Lanka;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka, has repeatedly invoked the LLRC as a domestic mechanism to
			 address issues arising from the war’s conclusion, but has simultaneously
			 distanced itself from many of the LLRC’s final recommendations;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in the almost 4 years since the tabling of the LLRC report in Sri Lanka’s Parliament, very
			 few of its recommendations have been successfully implemented, forcing the
			 United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2014, to pass a resolution
			 calling for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to
			 conduct a comprehensive investigation into allegations of serious
			 violations and abuses of human rights;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the LLRC noted that the failure of successive governments to implement the “critical
			 recommendations of past commissions gives rise to understandable criticism
			 and skepticism regarding Government appointed Commissions from which the
			 LLRC has not been spared”;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Sri Lanka has made progress on resettlement of displaced persons and
			 improvements to infrastructure in the North and East;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Department of State's 2012 Human Rights Report on Sri Lanka outlines
			 ongoing concerns regarding landownership and property restitution,
			 including instances where large numbers of persons have not received
			 restitution for land that remains part of government high security zones;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the continued military presence on private lands is preventing the full resettlement of
			 internally displaced persons who desire a return to peaceful life;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the September 21, 2013, elections in Sri Lanka for the Northern, Central, and North Western
			 Provincial Councils were a good first step in devolving power to the
			 provinces, though providing all councils with the ability to make their
			 own development and policing decisions would enhance the impact of such
			 elections;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the President of Sri Lanka committed to a political solution with implementation of the
			 country’s 13th amendment to bring about lasting peace and reconciliation
			 in Sri Lanka as codified in the Sri Lankan Government supported 2009
			 United Nations Human Rights Council resolution S–11/Assistance to Sri
			 Lanka in the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas negotiations on a political solution to the conflict between officials from the Sri Lanka
			 Freedom Party and the Tamil National Alliance ended unsuccessfully in 2011
			 after the government walked away;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas reconciliation is a long-term process that will need to be led by the Sri Lankan Government
			 and driven by the people of Sri Lanka, including civil society and
			 nongovernmental organizations;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the removal of the country’s chief justice, decreasing space for dissent, continued
			 militarization throughout the country, and intimidation of journalists and
			 critics of the government have created a sense of impunity and creeping
			 authoritarianism within Sri Lanka;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there have been repeated reports of attacks on places of worship and those practicing their
			 faith, restrictions on the media throughout Sri Lanka, and few instances
			 in which the perpetrators of such attacks have been held to account;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there have been numerous unaddressed allegations of arbitrary detention, sexual violence,
			 torture, and abuse of detainees by police and security forces in Sri
			 Lanka’s north and east during the end of the war, and which are ongoing
			 and have increased after the war;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Department of State's 2012 Human Rights Report on Sri Lanka also includes
			 reports of serious human rights violations such as unlawful killings by
			 security forces and government-allied paramilitary groups;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas progress on investigations into reports of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other
			 human rights violations during the conflict and promoting reconciliation
			 would facilitate enhanced United States engagement, bilateral trade, and
			 investment in Sri Lanka and coincide with United States policy that such
			 commissions of inquiry have been instrumental in providing accountability
			 and redressing wrong doing during periods of internal strife; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States is home to a large Sri Lankan diaspora, including Sinhalese, Tamils, and
			 Muslims, who have become an integral part of United States society: Now,
			 therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
