 Opposing the International Olympic Committee's decision to eliminate 
       wrestling from the Summer Olympic Games beginning in 2020.

Whereas wrestling is recognized as one of the world's oldest competitive sports 
        dating back to 3000 BC;
Whereas wrestling was one of the original sports of the ancient Greek Olympic 
        Games and of the first modern Olympic Games;
Whereas wrestling is one of the world's most diverse sports, with participants 
        from almost 200 countries around the world;
Whereas over 280,000 high school students in the United States participated in 
        wrestling in 2012;
Whereas there are over 300 intercollegiate wrestling programs in the United 
        States;
Whereas wrestling represents the determination and hard work it takes to succeed 
        in life and sport;
Whereas the United States has a long, proud, and storied Olympic wrestling 
        history; and
Whereas wrestling epitomizes the spirit of the Olympic Games: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) opposes the decision of the International Olympic 
        Committee to eliminate wrestling from the Summer Olympic Games 
        beginning in 2020;
            (2) thanks the United States Olympic Committee for their 
        continued support of wrestling and encourages them to work 
        actively to reverse this decision; and
            (3) urges the International Olympic Committee to reinstate 
        wrestling as a core sport of the Summer Olympic Games.
                                 <all>
