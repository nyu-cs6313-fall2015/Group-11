                               RESOLUTION


 
Calls on the Government of Turkey to allow free expression and Internet 
                                freedom.

Whereas an independent, unfettered media and freedom of expression, including 
        the Internet and social media, are essential elements of democratic, 
        transparent, and open societies;
Whereas millions of people in Turkey, including senior members of the Government 
        of Turkey, use the Internet and social media to communicate on a daily 
        basis;
Whereas the Government of Turkey imposed a countrywide ban on access to Twitter 
        on March 20, 2014, and to YouTube on March 27, 2014, blocking the use of 
        the communications platforms;
Whereas respected nongovernmental organizations have condemned the decision to 
        block Twitter and YouTube as an attack on Internet freedom and freedom 
        of expression in Turkey;
Whereas Twitter has been blocked in Turkey, China, Iran, North Korea, and Syria 
        and YouTube has been blocked in Turkey, China, Iran, and Pakistan;
Whereas the Turkish Bar Association argued that the ban on Twitter is 
        unconstitutional and in violation of Turkish and European human rights 
        laws; and
Whereas on March 26, 2014, the Turkish district court in Ankara blocked 
        implementation of the ban due to the restriction on freedom of 
        expression and communication that are protected by the Turkish 
        Constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) calls on the Government of Turkey to lift restrictions 
        on freedom of the press, freedom of expression, and Internet 
        freedom, including social media, in Turkey;
            (2) recognizes the critical role that technology and social 
        media play in helping independent journalists and the general 
        public to communicate, access information, and support 
        accountability; and
            (3) reaffirms the importance of Internet freedom to promote 
        democracy and good governance around the world.
