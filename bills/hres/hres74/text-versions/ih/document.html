                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the goals and objectives of Ireland's Presidency of the 
                     Council of the European Union.

Whereas Ireland holds the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European 
        Union during the first half of 2013;
Whereas the rotating European Union Presidency offers member states the 
        opportunity to showcase their vision for the European Union, to advance 
        the Union's ongoing work agenda, influence European Union policy and 
        legislation, and broaden the understanding of the European Union amongst 
        the citizens of their country;
Whereas the European Union has established an area of freedom, security, and 
        justice, extending stability and peace to the European continent and its 
        neighbors;
Whereas the United States has supported the European integration process and has 
        consistently supported the objective of European unity and the 
        enlargement of the European Union as a vehicle for prosperity, peace, 
        and democracy;
Whereas the Government of Ireland has prioritized stability, jobs, and growth as 
        the main areas of focus for Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the 
        European Union;
Whereas the United States and the European Union are each other's largest 
        trading and investment partners, responsible for creating up to an 
        estimated 14,000,000 jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, and as such 
        major stakeholders in each other's economic recoveries;
Whereas the United States and Ireland participate in long-standing research and 
        science-based exchanges that promote renewable and marine technologies 
        worldwide;
Whereas Irish culture and Irish-Americans have contributed greatly to United 
        States society, history, and politics; and
Whereas approximately one in four United States citizens trace some part of 
        their ancestry to Ireland: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and objectives of Ireland's 
        Presidency of the Council of the European Union;
            (2) encourages the launch of United States-European Union 
        trade and investment negotiations that will benefit both United 
        States and European workers alike;
            (3) promotes increased transatlantic exchanges and dialogue 
        to further benefit from existing cultural ties and research and 
        development partnerships, particularly in the maritime area 
        where a transatlantic research alliance could underpin the 
        development of the strong growth and jobs potential of our 
        shared ocean resources, a so-called blue growth strategy;
            (4) affirms the deep roots of common heritage between the 
        United States and Ireland; and
            (5) acknowledges the lasting contributions of Irish-
        Americans to the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
