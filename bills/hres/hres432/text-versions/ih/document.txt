                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the unification of the Island of 
Crete with the Hellenic Republic and expressing support for designation 
             of December 1, 2013, as ``Cretan Enosis Day''.

Whereas December 1, 2013, has been recognized as the 100th anniversary of the 
        1913 unification (ENOSIS) of the Island of Crete with the Hellenic 
        Republic, by communities, citizens, and organizations around the United 
        States and the world;
Whereas the unification of the Island of Crete with the Hellenic Republic on 
        December 1, 1913, resulted from over 267 years of struggle by the brave 
        and resolute Greek people of Crete against the harsh occupation of the 
        Ottoman Empire beginning in 1669;
Whereas the knowledge of this relentless struggle for freedom by the people of 
        Crete, culminating in the signing of the Treaty of London which unified 
        Crete with the Hellenic Republic, is an inspiration to freedom-loving 
        people everywhere;
Whereas the memory of thousands of brave Cretans who sacrificed their lives 
        following the creed ``Freedom or Death'' in order to gain freedom and 
        unification with Greece, its motherland, should be remembered and 
        revered; and
Whereas December 1, 2013, would be an appropriate date to designate as ``Cretan 
        Enosis Day'' in recognition of these brave deeds and sacrifices by the 
        people of the Island of Crete: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the 100th anniversary of the unification of 
        the Island of Crete with the Hellenic Republic; and
            (2) supports the designation of ``Cretan Enosis Day'' in 
        recognition of these brave deeds and sacrifices by the people 
        of the Island of Crete.
                                 <all>
