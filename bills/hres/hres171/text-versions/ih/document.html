                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the Republic of the Sudan for its actions to pardon Mubarak 
Mustafa, who was responsible for the escape of two men convicted of the 
assassination of John Granville on January 1, 2008, and calling on the 
 United States Department of State to continue to include Sudan on the 
                  list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Whereas John Granville was a Fulbright Scholar and Peace Corps volunteer who 
        became a career diplomat for the United States Agency for International 
        Development;
Whereas in 2007, John Granville was working in the Republic of the Sudan to 
        facilitate free elections in the war-torn country;
Whereas on January 1, 2008, John Granville and his driver Abdel Rahman Abbas 
        were brutally murdered by Islamic extremists in Khartoum, Sudan;
Whereas on June 24, 2009, four men, Abdelraouf Abu Zaid Mohamed Hamza, Mohamed 
        Makawi Ibrahim Mohamed, Abdelbasit Alhaj Alhasan Haj Hamad, and Mohanad 
        Osman Yousif Mohamed, were convicted for their involvement in the 
        plotting and execution of the assassination;
Whereas on June 10, 2010, these four men escaped prison in Sudan through the aid 
        of Mubarak Mustafa;
Whereas two of the four men, Haj Hamad, and Mohamed Makawi Ibrahim Mohamed, 
        remain at-large;
Whereas the President of Sudan granted a pardon to Mubarak Mustafa;
Whereas the United States Department of State has issued a strong condemnation 
        of the pardon of Mubarak Mustafa; and
Whereas the United States Department of State has authorized a $5,000,000 
        payment through their Rewards for Justice Program for information that 
        leads to the capture of either of the escaped prisoners: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns in the strongest terms the Government of the 
        Republic of the Sudan's pardon of Mubarak Mustafa for his role 
        in allowing the men convicted of the assassination of John 
        Granville to escape imprisonment; and
            (2) calls on the United States Department of State to 
        continue to list Sudan on the state sponsors of terrorism list 
        until such time as the men convicted of the assassination of 
        John Granville are apprehended and the pardon of Mubarak 
        Mustafa is repealed.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
