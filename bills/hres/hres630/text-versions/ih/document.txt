                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the benefits and importance of music making as an essential 
form of creative expression and expressing support for designating the 
           Summer Solstice, June 21, 2014, as Make Music Day.

Whereas the Summer Solstice, June 21, is the first day of summer and an 
        appropriate day to annually celebrate the myriad of joys and benefits of 
        making music;
Whereas this event began over 30 years ago in France as Fete de la Musique, and 
        observations of Make Music Day now take place internationally in 800 
        cities in 110 countries around the world;
Whereas these celebrations have become a global phenomenon involving millions of 
        musicians of all styles and skill levels, performing publicly;
Whereas making music continues to demonstrate the power of music as providing 
        enjoyment, building cultural connections, raising social awareness, 
        celebrating history, and examining the whole of the human experience;
Whereas making music inspires people of all abilities, persuasions, and 
        ethnicities to come together to ``just play'';
Whereas making music is an integral part of United States culture and a 
        chronicle of the Nation's struggles and triumphs;
Whereas making music advances learning, enhances the overall educational 
        experience, and contributes to a complete education;
Whereas making music is shown to benefit the well-being of people throughout 
        their lives, and that making music contributes to a fuller, more 
        satisfying life; and
Whereas Make Music Day will come to life throughout the United States with 
        thousands of events on June 21, 2014, when musicians of all ages and 
        abilities will perform on streets, sidewalks, stoops, plazas, parks, in 
        group lessons, solo performances, instrument circles, musical parades, 
        and mass appeal events open to all: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of Make Music Day to celebrate 
        the national commitment to making music and the importance of 
        access to music education for all children; and
            (2) recognizes Make Music Day organizers and volunteers 
        across the United States for promoting Make Music Day and for 
        their efforts in promoting awareness of the benefits of making 
        music and the importance of access to music education.
                                 <all>
