                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of the week of September 15, 2014, 
       through September 21, 2014, as ``Balance Awareness Week''.

Whereas vestibular (inner-ear-balance) disorders are underdiagnosed and 
        undertreated;
Whereas as many as 35 percent of adults 40 years of age and older in the United 
        States--approximately 69 million Americans--have experienced some form 
        of vestibular dysfunction;
Whereas 80 percent of people 65 years of age and older have experienced 
        dizziness;
Whereas vestibular disorder patients may consult 4 or more physicians and spend 
        50 months or more in their search for a diagnosis;
Whereas the Vestibular Disorders Association celebrates ``Balance Awareness 
        Week'' to reduce the time it takes to diagnose a vestibular disorder by 
        helping patients recognize their symptoms and encouraging them to seek 
        help from a qualified vestibular specialist; and
Whereas the week of September 15, 2014, through September 21, 2014, would be an 
        appropriate week to designate as ``Balance Awareness Week'': Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Balance Awareness Week''; 
        and
            (2) recognizes the importance of raising public awareness 
        about vestibular disorders.
                                 <all>
