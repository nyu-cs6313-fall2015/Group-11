    Recognizing the importance of ports to the economy and national 
                     security of the United States.

Whereas ports play a vital role in the United States economy;
Whereas ports impact lives in every Congressional District in the United States 
        by creating jobs, economic growth, and opportunity;
Whereas the United States is served by more than 350 commercial sea and river 
        ports that support 3,200 cargo and passenger handling facilities;
Whereas each day, United States ports move both imports and exports totaling 
        some $3.8 billion worth of goods through all 50 States and territories;
Whereas deep-draft ports move 99.4 percent of overseas cargo volume by weight 
        and 64.1 percent of trade by value;
Whereas ports move 1.4 billion tons worth of goods and generate $3.95 trillion 
        in international trade;
Whereas between 2001 and 2020, total freight moved through United States ports 
        will increase by 50 percent;
Whereas trucks and rail move goods across the United States and contribute to 
        the national economy;
Whereas more than 1 billion tons of domestic goods are transported via water 
        each year;
Whereas ports generated $23.3 billion in United States Custom duty, accounting 
        for 70 percent of all United States Custom duties collected;
Whereas international trade moving through ports accounts for 11 percent of the 
        gross domestic product of the United States;
Whereas port activity generates over $200 billion in Federal, State, and local 
        tax revenue;
Whereas ports support jobs for more than 13.3 million people in the United 
        States nationwide;
Whereas for every $1 billion in exports shipped through ports, 15,000 United 
        States jobs are created;
Whereas business activity related to seaports contributes $3.15 trillion to the 
        United States economy;
Whereas the cruise line industry contributed $35.85 billion to the United States 
        economy and created nearly 330,000 jobs in the United States that 
        generated $15.2 billion in wages in 2010;
Whereas United States ports account for 75 percent of cruise embarkations 
        worldwide; and
Whereas 79 percent of cruise-related expenditures are made with businesses, 
        including airlines, travel agents, and ship maintenance and 
        refurbishers, throughout the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of ports to the economy and 
        national security of the United States;
            (2) urges the President, Federal officials, and other 
        relevant stakeholders to consider this importance in 
        decisionmaking and promote policies that strengthen seaport-
        related infrastructure;
            (3) affirms the longstanding Federal partnership with ports 
        as it relates to improvements to port-related infrastructure 
        and its commitment to ensuring the safety of the United States 
        ports and the communities in which they are located; and
            (4) expresses its gratitude to the millions of men and 
        women who work at ports across the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
