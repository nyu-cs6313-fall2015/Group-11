                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of the week of May 3, 2014, through May 
  10, 2014, as ``National Osteogenesis Imperfecta Awareness Week'' to 
  celebrate the progress made, and recognize the work yet to be done 
   toward educating our communities, promoting research programs and 
 raising vital resources for doctors, nurses, and healthcare providers 
     and everyone touched by the Osteogenesis Imperfecta community.

Whereas Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), also known as ``brittle bone disease'' is 
        a genetic disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily;
Whereas the number of people in the United States affected with OI is estimated 
        to be 25,000 to 50,000;
Whereas a person with mild OI may experience a few fractures while those with 
        the severe forms may have hundreds in a lifetime;
Whereas OI occurs with equal frequency among males and females and among all 
        racial and ethnic groups;
Whereas at this time, there is no cure;
Whereas it is thought that OI causes many other serious chronic medical 
        conditions such as muscle weakness, joint laxity, fragile skin, hearing 
        loss, brittle teeth, fatigue, easy bleeding and bruising, scoliosis, 
        pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease;
Whereas experienced medical care for OI is limited;
Whereas a person is born with this disorder and is affected throughout his or 
        her lifetime;
Whereas despite the challenges of managing OI, most adults and children who have 
        OI lead productive and successful lives; and
Whereas May 3, 2014, through May 10, 2014, has been designated by the 
        Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation as ``National Osteogenesis Imperfecta 
        Awareness Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports--
                    (A) the goals and ideals of ``National Osteogenesis 
                Imperfecta Awareness Week'';
                    (B) efforts to educate the people in the United 
                States about Osteogenesis Imperfecta;
                    (C) efforts to promote research; and
                    (D) efforts in raising vital resources for doctors, 
                nurses, and health care providers;
            (2) recognizes the critical importance of these goals and 
        efforts as part of wellness strategies; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        ``National Osteogenesis Imperfecta Awareness Week'' with 
        appropriate programs and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
