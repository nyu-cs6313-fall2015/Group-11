                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of International Mother Language Day in 
   bringing attention to the importance of preserving linguistic and 
                  cultural heritage through education.

Whereas the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization 
        (UNESCO) established International Mother Language Day on November 17, 
        1999, to promote linguistic diversity and multilingualism;
Whereas the annual International Mother Language Day celebration date, February 
        21, was chosen to commemorate the day in 1952 in Bangladesh where 
        students died demonstrating for recognition of Bengali as a national 
        language of Pakistan;
Whereas UNESCO establishes a different theme for the annual celebration of 
        International Mother Language Day each year, promoting various aspects 
        of linguistic education;
Whereas according to the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, out of 
        the over 6,000 existing languages in the world, more than 200 have 
        become extinct during the last three generations, and 2,279 other 
        languages are classified as ``endangered'';
Whereas the United States Census Bureau has identified at least 381 languages 
        spoken in the United States, 169 of which are distinct Native American 
        languages;
Whereas according to the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, 145 
        languages in the United States are classified as ``endangered''; and
Whereas the United States enjoys a rich and diverse cultural heritage and 
        preserving existing languages is an essential piece to preserving this 
        heritage: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of International Mother 
        Language Day; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        International Mother Language Day with appropriate ceremonies, 
        programs, and activities.
                                 <all>
