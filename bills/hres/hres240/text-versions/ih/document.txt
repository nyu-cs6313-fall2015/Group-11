                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                              May 23, 2013

    Mr. Reed (for himself, Mr. Barr, and Mr. Huizenga of Michigan)

                        on House Administration

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Directing the Clerk of the House of Representatives to place a real 
  time display of the United States gross national debt in the House 
                                Chamber.

Whereas Members of Congress should keep the gross national debt in mind when 
        debating legislation that would affect the nation's fiscal situation;
Whereas by displaying our national debt in real time in the House Chamber, 
        Members of Congress can better debate our nation's fiscal situation;
Whereas from 1791 to 1984, the total accumulated Federal deficit was $1.5 
        trillion;
Whereas the projected Federal debt in 2013 is $16.8 trillion;
Whereas Members of Congress should be constantly reminded that the gross 
        national debt must be reduced;
Whereas a real time display of the gross national debt will inform every Member 
        of Congress of the need to take action to reduce the debt;
Whereas the exact amount of the gross national debt will be known and updated 
        with every action affecting the amount of debt; and
Whereas display of the national debt in the chamber of the House of 
        Representatives will be a sign that representatives are committed to 
        reducing the national debt: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,

SECTION 1. PLACEMENT OF NATIONAL DEBT CLOCK ON THE HOUSE FLOOR.

    (a) Responsibilities of Clerk.--The Clerk of the House of 
Representatives shall place a real time display of the United States

accordance with regulations promulgated by the Committee on House 
Administration.
                                 <all>
