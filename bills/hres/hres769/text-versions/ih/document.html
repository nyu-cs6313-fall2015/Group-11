                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the 
healthcare, energy, telecommunications, and other sectors of the United 
States economy should continue their sector-specific efforts to protect 
critical infrastructure, to prevent information security breaches, and 
                   to prevent cybersecurity breaches.

Whereas the United States economy is diverse, and has many different sectors;
Whereas each sector faces different challenges related to critical 
        infrastructure, information security, and cybersecurity; and
Whereas the healthcare, energy, telecommunications, and other industry sectors 
        are taking sector-specific steps to protect critical infrastructure, to 
        prevent information security breaches, and to prevent cybersecurity 
        breaches: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the healthcare sector should continue its sector-
        specific efforts to protect critical infrastructure, to prevent 
        information security breaches, and to prevent cybersecurity 
        breaches (other than for research and development purposes);
            (2) the energy sector should continue its sector-specific 
        efforts to protect critical infrastructure, to prevent 
        information security breaches, and to prevent cybersecurity 
        breaches (other than for research and development purposes);
            (3) the telecommunications sector should continue its 
        sector-specific efforts to protect critical infrastructure, to 
        prevent information security breaches, and to prevent 
        cybersecurity breaches (other than for research and development 
        purposes); and
            (4) other industry sectors should continue their sector-
        specific efforts to protect critical infrastructure, to prevent 
        information security breaches, and to prevent cybersecurity 
        breaches (other than for research and development purposes).
