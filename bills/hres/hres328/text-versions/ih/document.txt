                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the discrimination, hate crimes, racism, bigotry, bullying, 
and brutal violence perpetrated against Sikh-Americans, and all acts of 
vandalism against Sikh Gurdwaras in the United States, and remembering 
 the tragedy that occurred at the Sikh Gurdwara of Wisconsin one year 
                                  ago.

Whereas Sikh-Americans have frequently been stereotyped solely because of their 
        appearance, practices and traditions;
Whereas numerous Sikh temples have been defaced and Sikh-Americans attacked out 
        of ignorance and hatred, including instances in Michigan, New York, 
        California, and Washington;
Whereas some incidents against Sikh-Americans appear to be erroneous attempts to 
        place blame or exact retribution for the September 11, 2001, terrorist 
        attacks;
Whereas the heinous attack and killing of six persons and wounding of others in 
        the Sikh Gurdwara of Wisconsin occurred a year ago on August 5, 2012;
Whereas a Sikh-American cab driver was assaulted on October 17, 2012, near 
        Seattle, Washington;
Whereas a Sikh-American-owned convenience store in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was set 
        ablaze on March 5, 2013;
Whereas 82-year-old Piara Singh was brutally attacked as he was leaving his 
        Gurdwara in Fresno, California, on May 8, 2013;
Whereas Sikh-Americans are often targeted solely because of their unique dress 
        and religious practices;
Whereas surveys have found that up to 3 out of every 4 Sikh boys in the United 
        States are bullied due to their appearance;
Whereas the Sikh faith is the world's fifth largest religion, with more than 
        25,000,000 practitioners worldwide, upwards of 500,000 of whom reside in 
        the United States;
Whereas Sikh-Americans have lived in the United States for at least 100 years as 
        pillars of society, making invaluable contributions in business, 
        politics, science, and education;
Whereas Sikh-Americans serve in all roles of American life, including as family 
        members, business owners, elected leaders, and members of the United 
        States military;
Whereas Dalip Singh Saund served as a Sikh-American member of the U.S. House of 
        Representatives in the late 1950s and early 1960s; and
Whereas under successive Administrations, the Department of Justice has 
        rightfully reached out to the Sikh community to prevent discrimination 
        and protect its civil liberties: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the commission of hate crimes against all 
        Americans, including Sikh-Americans;
            (2) condemns acts of violence, bigotry and discrimination 
        against Sikh-Americans;
            (3) urges educators, counselors and others to support 
        educational efforts to prevent the epidemic bullying of Sikh-
        American children and families;
            (4) supports outreach efforts by Federal and local law 
        enforcement leaders to prevent violence and hate crimes against 
        Sikh-Americans;
            (5) appreciates the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
        Advisory Policy Board for recommending the tracking of hate 
        crimes against Sikh-Americans, Hindu-Americans, Arab-Americans, 
        and other groups; and
            (6) urges the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the 
        Department of Justice to expeditiously adopt and subsequently 
        work to implement the Advisory Policy Board's recommendations.
                                 <all>
