                  Celebrating the Molalla Centennial.

Whereas on August 23, 1913, after decades as a United States settlement and 
        thousands of years as a sacred home to indigenous peoples, Molalla was 
        incorporated as a city in the State of Oregon;
Whereas the Molalla Indians, whose descendants are members of the Confederated 
        Tribes of Grand Ronde, first inhabited Molalla;
Whereas settlers arrived in the area in the mid-nineteenth century, before 
        Oregon became a State;
Whereas during the 1850s, Molalla became home to schools, a post office, a 
        general store, trade, and an active agricultural industry;
Whereas the Molalla Pioneer was established as Molalla's first newspaper in 1913 
        and continues to serve Molalla today;
Whereas in 1913, Molalla celebrated the arrival of its first steam train with a 
        rodeo, taken over in 1923 by the Molalla Buckeroo Association and now 
        known as the Molalla Buckeroo;
Whereas people from throughout the region participate in the annual Molalla 
        Buckeroo Rodeo and the Ross Coleman Invitational Professional Bull 
        Riding event;
Whereas timber production, nurseries, Christmas tree production, and other 
        agricultural industries have supported the Molalla economy for the past 
        century; and
Whereas thousands of people each year come to Molalla to experience the Molalla 
        River Recreation Corridor through kayaking, fishing, hunting, camping, 
        horseback riding, and other recreational activities: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives honors and commends the 
City of Molalla, Oregon, and its people on Molalla's centennial.
                                 <all>
