                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing no confidence in the Attorney General of the United States 
               and calling for his immediate resignation.

Whereas the United States Attorney General is a key position in the Executive 
        Branch;
Whereas the laws of the United States are enforced and upheld by the United 
        States Attorney General;
Whereas the Judiciary Act of 1789 created the Office of the Attorney General and 
        the Attorney General represents the United States in legal matters and 
        gives advice and opinions to the President and to the heads of the 
        executive departments of the United States Government;
Whereas the people of the United States need to have full confidence in the 
        Attorney General of the United States;
Whereas the people of the United States need assurance that the top law 
        enforcement official in the United States will uphold the Constitution, 
        and that he is competent, trustworthy, and beyond reproach;
Whereas the people of the United States further expect that when mistakes are 
        made, the Nation's top law enforcement office will not seek to cover up 
        such mistakes, but will cooperate with Congress and the American public 
        in disclosing the events and circumstances and transparently addressing 
        the issues;
Whereas the current United States Attorney General, Eric Holder, presided over 
        the Department of Justice as it conducted a law enforcement scheme 
        called ``Operation Fast and Furious'' that was ill conceived at the 
        outset and mismanaged for its duration;
Whereas according to information obtained through the House Oversight and 
        Government Reform Committee, Operation Fast and Furious allowed 
        thousands of weapons of various types to be illegally sold and or 
        transferred from the United States to violent drug cartels and known 
        criminals in Mexico and elsewhere;
Whereas weapons from Operation Fast and Furious have been used to violate United 
        States laws, Mexican laws, and international laws, including homicide, 
        kidnapping, and trafficking laws;
Whereas under Attorney General Holder's watch, this operation demonstrated no 
        proper monitoring of the guns being sold or transferred, and failed to 
        interdict the weapons;
Whereas Attorney General Holder further failed to inform or cooperate with 
        Mexican authorities even though weapons were being sent to Mexico;
Whereas currently, Mexico is under severe stress due to drug cartel wars;
Whereas in January 2012, the Government of Mexico confirmed that 47,515 people 
        were killed in drug-related incidents between 2006 and 2011;
Whereas credible sources estimate that at least 300 Mexican deaths involved 
        weapons that came from Operation Fast and Furious;
Whereas the carnage resulting from Operation Fast and Furious is not limited to 
        Mexico;
Whereas the people of the United States will likely also incur further violence 
        as a result of this operation;
Whereas due to Attorney General Holder's failure to provide oversight or control 
        over Operation Fast and Furious, drug cartels have used Fast and Furious 
        weapons to wage attacks against United States law enforcement as well as 
        Mexican police and military outfits;
Whereas evidence further suggests that such guns have been used in the United 
        States, and were found at the crime scene surrounding the death of 
        Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, who was killed on December 14, 2010;
Whereas in response to Congressional inquiries, the Administration, through 
        Attorney General Holder's office, initially provided false information 
        in a letter to Congress dated February 4, 2011, that was subsequently 
        withdrawn;
Whereas in response to Congressional inquiries, the Administration, through 
        Attorney General Holder's office, has redacted key information and has 
        been intransigent, obstructionist, and obdurate;
Whereas in response to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives 
        whistleblowers who came to Congress for redress, the Administration, 
        through Attorney General Holder's office, retaliated against such 
        whistleblowers;
Whereas the Administration, at the request of Attorney General Holder, claimed 
        executive privilege to block the disclosure of duly subpoenaed documents 
        relating to a Congressional investigation; and
Whereas Attorney General Holder was found in contempt of Congress on June 28, 
        2012: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress has lost confidence in the Attorney General of the United 
States and thereby calls for his immediate resignation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
