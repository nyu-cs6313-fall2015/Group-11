                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing condolences and support for assistance to the victims of the 
               historic flooding in the Western Balkans.

Whereas record rainfall beginning on May 13, 2014, has caused widespread 
        flooding in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, and the 
        Republic of Serbia, causing thousands of landslides, massive 
        destruction, and loss of life;
Whereas as of May 22, 2014, the flooding had caused over 40 deaths and impacted 
        over 500,000 people across the region, particularly in western Serbia 
        and eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina;
Whereas the equivalent of 3 months of rain fell during the course of 3 days, 
        making this the worst flooding event seen in Serbia and Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina in 120 years;
Whereas the flooding has left thousands stranded in their homes waiting for 
        assistance, displaced, or homeless;
Whereas according to the Red Cross, 300,000 people in Serbia and 50,000 people 
        in Bosnia and Herzegovina are without clean water or electricity;
Whereas the Bosnian Foreign Ministry has reported that the flooding has rendered 
        100,000 buildings unusable, 500,000 people have evacuated or fled their 
        homes, and 14 municipalities are in a state of emergency;
Whereas the Government of Serbia has described the situation in the country as 
        ``catastrophic'', and estimates that at least 25,000 people have 
        evacuated, particularly in the town and municipality of Obrenovac, and 
        that the flooding has caused over 100,000,000 Euros ($140 million) in 
        damage to the Kolubara coal mine that supplies the Kostolac power plant;
Whereas soldiers and energy workers scrambled to erect sandbag barriers to 
        protect the Kostolac power plant and the Nikola Tesla power plant, which 
        provides half of the nation's electricity, from the waters of the over-
        flooded Sava River;
Whereas an estimated 100,000 landmines remaining from the Balkan conflicts of 
        the 1990s have been lost or dislodged due to landslides, causing great 
        concern for public safety;
Whereas the United States Government has provided $100,000 in assistance through 
        the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) as a grant to the 
        Serbian Red Cross, which has been used to procure 3 boats and trailers 
        to deliver to the Ministry of Interior, and $50,000 from the Under 
        Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs to fund flood 
        cleanup projects with non-governmental organizations (NGOs);
Whereas in addition, United States Embassy funds have been used to purchase 
        sandbags and other material assistance to respond to flooding, and 
        Embassy volunteers filled hundreds of sandbags in a Belgrade suburb 
        still threatened by Sava River flooding on May 18, 2014, and donated 
        1,000 more sandbags on May 19, 2014;
Whereas the United States Government has further provided $50,000 in OFDA 
        assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as donated 26 boats 
        through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and 5 
        trucks of food and supplies worth over $650,000 for Banja Luka, and the 
        Department of Defense is also providing supplies to people affected by 
        the flooding; and
Whereas Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, and the Republic of 
        Serbia share an increasing commitment to core democratic values, 
        reconciliation, and European integration: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses deep sympathy to all those affected by the 
        flooding in the Western Balkans for the terrible loss of life 
        and massive destruction;
            (2) expresses solidarity with the people of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, and the Republic of 
        Serbia, as well as a continued desire to provide essential 
        assistance to help their countries recover from the natural 
        disaster;
            (3) expresses ongoing support for humanitarian and 
        reconstruction assistance provided by relief agencies and the 
        international community as immediate and long-term needs are 
        identified;
            (4) commends local authorities, first responders and rescue 
        personnel, NGOs, volunteers, and everyday citizens for their 
        efforts to organize and deliver disaster relief to communities 
        in need across Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, 
        and the Republic of Serbia; and
            (5) urges additional assistance by other nations and 
        organizations as needed to alleviate the difficult 
        circumstances and suffering of the people of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia, and the Republic of 
        Serbia, and assist them in their recovery efforts.
