<whereas><text>Whereas an estimated 100,000 landmines remaining from the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s have been lost or dislodged due to landslides, causing great concern for public safety; </text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government has provided $100,000 in assistance through the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) as a grant to the Serbian Red Cross, which has been used to procure 3 boats and trailers to deliver to the Ministry of Interior, and $50,000 from the Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs to fund flood cleanup projects with non-governmental organizations (NGOs); </text></whereas>
