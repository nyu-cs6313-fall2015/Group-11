                               RESOLUTION


 
To recognize and honor our Nation's veterans on the 70th anniversaries 
                        of World War II battles.

Whereas on December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States 
        was attacked at Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii, resulting in the loss of 
        more than 2,400 American lives;
Whereas the United States joined allies from 32 countries to fight the common 
        foe of fascism in a war in which more than 16,000,000 Americans served 
        in the military;
Whereas the United States suffered over 670,000 casualties, including more than 
        400,000 deaths, and over 105,000 Americans were held as prisoners of 
        war; and
Whereas on May 29, 2004, the United States gratefully dedicated the World War II 
        Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, DC: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors all veterans, living and deceased, of the Second 
        World War on the 70th anniversaries of the courageous battles 
        and expresses the deep appreciation and gratitude of the United 
        States for their valor and selfless service to their country;
            (2) calls upon the people of the United States to recognize 
        the 70th anniversaries of major battles throughout the War to 
        remember and appreciate the members of the greatest generation 
        who, through their sacrifices both in the Armed Forces and on 
        the homefront, preserved liberty for future generations and 
        rescued the world from the scourge of fascist militarism; and
            (3) calls upon the people and organizations of the United 
        States to assist veterans of the Second World War in 
        representing America abroad during ceremonies recognizing the 
        70th anniversaries of American battles to honor and remember 
        the sacrifices our veterans made to preserve freedom.
                                 <all>
