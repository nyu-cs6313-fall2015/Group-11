  <summary>6/11/2014--Introduced.
States that the House of Representatives: (1) recognizes that heart disease remains the number one killer of women in the United States, that this is untenable, and that basic, preventive heart disease screenings should be a routine part of women's health care; (2) recognizes the importance of early screening wherever women seek primary care; and (3) commits to improving the heart health of all women, tearing down barriers that prevent women from getting screened for heart disease, ensuring women are provided with personalized lifestyle modification recommendations and support, and ensuring all women have a healthy heart.</summary>
