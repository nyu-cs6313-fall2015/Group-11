                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing that cardiovascular disease continues to be an overwhelming 
    threat to women's health and the importance of providing basic, 
 preventive heart screenings to women wherever they seek primary care.

Whereas heart disease remains the leading cause of death for women in the United 
        States, causing 1 in 4 female deaths and more deaths than all forms of 
        cancer combined;
Whereas since 1984, the number of deaths from heart disease for women has 
        exceeded those for men;
Whereas the rate of cardiovascular death is increasing by 1 percent each year 
        among women ages 35 to 44;
Whereas heart disease claims the life of nearly 422,000 women each year;
Whereas almost half of all African-American women have some form of 
        cardiovascular disease and are more likely to die from heart disease 
        than White women;
Whereas heart disease and stroke account for $312.6 billion in health care 
        expenditures and lost productivity annually;
Whereas only 54 percent of women recognize that their number one killer is heart 
        disease and almost two-thirds of women who unexpectedly die of heart 
        disease have no previous symptoms of disease;
Whereas many women, especially younger women, may not be aware of their risk for 
        heart disease because they have never gotten a basic, preventive heart 
        screening and have no symptoms;
Whereas studies show that nearly 1 in 5 women rely solely on their OB/GYN for 
        primary care, yet only 35 percent of women recall having even discussed 
        heart disease with their OB/GYN;
Whereas identifying cardiovascular disease risk factors early, such as high 
        blood pressure, smoking, excessive weight and obesity, high cholesterol, 
        and diabetes, allows for more effective intervention and treatment, and 
        can dramatically lower a woman's overall risk of heart disease and heart 
        attack;
Whereas the burden of women's heart disease can be reduced in the United States 
        by ensuring that wherever women seek care they get a basic, preventive 
        heart disease screening;
Whereas experts recommend and encourage that a basic, preventive heart screening 
        be a routine part of a woman's visit to a primary care practitioner; and
Whereas once women understand their risk, they also need follow-up information, 
        support, and incentives to maintain cardiovascular health and make the 
        most informed decisions: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes that despite improved education and 
        awareness, heart disease remains the number one killer of women 
        in the United States and this result is untenable;
            (2) recognizes the importance of early basic, preventive 
        cardiovascular screening for women, wherever they seek primary 
        care, so that all women can know their risks and what can be 
        done to reduce them;
            (3) recognizes that basic, preventive heart disease 
        screenings should be a routine part of women's health care; and
            (4) commits to improving the heart health of all women, 
        tearing down the barriers that prevent women from getting 
        screened for heart disease, ensuring women are provided with 
        personalized lifestyle modification recommendations and 
        support, and ensuring all women have a healthy heart.
