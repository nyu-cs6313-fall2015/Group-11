H. Res. 657

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                         July 11, 2014.
Whereas Hamas is a United States-designated terrorist organization whose charter 
        calls for the destruction of the State of Israel;
Whereas Hamas continues to reject the Quartet's core principles--recognize 
        Israel's right to exist, renounce violence, and accept previous Israeli-
        Palestinian agreements;
Whereas Hamas has killed hundreds of Israelis and dozens of Americans in rocket 
        attacks and suicide bombings;
Whereas since Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, Hamas and other terrorist 
        groups have fired thousands of rockets at Israel;
Whereas since June 2014, Hamas has fired nearly 300 rockets at Israel;
Whereas Hamas's weapons arsenal includes approximately 12,000 rockets that vary 
        in range;
Whereas Iran has long provided material support to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic 
        Jihad, including assistance that has enabled these terrorist 
        organizations to produce longer-range rockets capable of striking Tel 
        Aviv and Jerusalem;
Whereas innocent Israeli civilians are indiscriminately targeted by Hamas rocket 
        attacks;
Whereas the United States and Israel have cooperated on missile defense 
        projects, including Iron Dome, David's Sling, and the Arrow Anti-Missile 
        System, projects designed to thwart a diverse range of threats, 
        including short-range missiles and rockets fired by non-state actors, 
        such as Hamas;
Whereas the United States has provided $235,000,000 in fiscal year 2014 for Iron 
        Dome research, development, and production;
Whereas, during the most recent rocket attacks from Gaza, Iron Dome has 
        successfully intercepted dozens of rockets that were launched against 
        Israeli population centers; and
Whereas 5 million Israelis are currently living under the threat of rocket 
        attacks from Gaza: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) reaffirms its support for Israel's right to defend its citizens 
        and ensure the survival of the State of Israel;
            (2) condemns the unprovoked rocket fire at Israel; and
            (3) calls on Hamas to immediately cease all rocket and other attacks 
        against Israel.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
