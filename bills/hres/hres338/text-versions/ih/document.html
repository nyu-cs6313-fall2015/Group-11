                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the National Hellenic Museum in Chicago, Illinois, and the 
 contributions of Hellenism to the United States and celebrating Greek 
                        and American democracy.

Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States were inspired and guided by 
        the democratic principles and political philosophies of the ancient 
        Greeks;
Whereas the Greek and American people share a common heritage of personal 
        freedom and citizen participation in government;
Whereas Greek immigrants to the United States have brought from their Hellenic 
        origins a rich treasure of knowledge, science, history, culture, and art 
        that has contributed greatly to the unique fabric of American life;
Whereas Americans of Greek origin have contributed to and continue to contribute 
        to strengthening and enriching American life and democracy;
Whereas millions of Greek-Americans continue the great Hellenic traditions and 
        values in their families, their neighborhoods, their communities, their 
        States, and their nation;
Whereas the National Hellenic Museum in Chicago, Illinois, is a national 
        institution dedicated to fully celebrating this rich heritage through 
        the documentation, study, exhibition, and elucidation of Hellenic and 
        Greek-American history;
Whereas the National Hellenic Museum seeks to broaden and enrich public 
        knowledge of Hellenic life, history, and the Greek immigrant experience 
        and their contributions to the mosaic of American diversity and 
        strength; and
Whereas the National Hellenic Museum is home to a vast collection of literature, 
        historical data, antiquities, and artifacts, some dating back to 1200 
        BC, bringing to life the stories of ancient times, to great Greek-
        Americans from Civil War heroes, to scientists and humanitarians, and 
        continuing contributions to Greek-American life: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes--
            (1) the significant contributions of Hellenism and the 
        Greek community in the United States;
            (2) the rich history of Greek immigration to the United 
        States; and
            (3) the National Hellenic Museum in Chicago, Illinois, for 
        its role in the documentation, study, perpetuation, and 
        presentation of the Greek-American story, which serves to 
        broaden public understanding of the history, culture, and 
        contributions of Greek immigrants to the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
