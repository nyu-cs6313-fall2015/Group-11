                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing Linemen, the profession of Linemen, and the contributions 
 of these brave men and women to protect public safety, and expressing 
     support of designation of April 18, 2014, as National Lineman 
                           Appreciation Day.

Whereas the profession of Lineman is steeped in personal, family, and 
        professional tradition;
Whereas Linemen are often first responders during storms and other catastrophic 
        events where these brave men and women work to make the scene safe for 
        the other public safety heroes;
Whereas Linemen work with thousands of volts of electricity high atop power 
        lines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to keep electricity flowing;
Whereas Linemen must often work under dangerous conditions far from their 
        families to construct and maintain the Nation's energy infrastructure;
Whereas Linemen put their lives on the line every day with little recognition or 
        appreciation from the community regarding the danger of their work; and
Whereas April 18, 2014, would be an appropriate date to designate as National 
        Lineman's Appreciation Day: Now therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the efforts of Linemen in keeping the power 
        on and protecting public safety; and
            (2) supports the designation of National Lineman 
        Appreciation Day.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
