                               RESOLUTION


 
  Congratulating the Minority Business Development Agency on its 45th 
     anniversary and commending its achievements in fostering the 
 establishment and growth of minority businesses in the United States.

Whereas the success of minority businesses is a critical component of a robust 
        economy in the United States;
Whereas minority businesses employ 5,800,000 people and generate $1 trillion to 
        the economy of the United States;
Whereas minority businesses are supporting the global competitiveness of the 
        United States by utilizing the most effective export capabilities of any 
        segment of the United States economy;
Whereas minority businesses are more likely to generate revenue through exports 
        compared to non-minority businesses due to language capabilities, 
        cultural competence, ancestral ties, and business agility;
Whereas, in 1969, there were 322,000 minority businesses with $11,000,000,000 in 
        gross receipts and the number of minority businesses has continued to 
        increase to nearly 6,000,000 as estimated by the United States Census 
        Bureau;
Whereas the Minority Business Development Agency was established by Executive 
        Order 11458 on March 5, 1969;
Whereas the Minority Business Development Agency has operated for 45 years as 
        the only Federal agency created specifically to serve and foster the 
        growth of minority entrepreneurs;
Whereas the Minority Business Development Agency operates a nationwide network 
        of MBDA Business Centers to assist with the expansion and 
        competitiveness of the rapidly growing minority business community;
Whereas, in fiscal year 2013, the Minority Business Development Agency helped 
        minority businesses gain access to over $4,800,000,000 in contracts and 
        capital, which contributed in excess of 25,000 American jobs created or 
        retained;
Whereas, since 1969, the Minority Business Development Agency has served nearly 
        660,000 minority businesses and assisted in securing more than 
        $25,000,000,000 in contracts and capital for these minority businesses; 
        and
Whereas the long-term strategic direction of the Minority Business Development 
        Agency is to achieve entrepreneurial parity so that the number of 
        businesses that are minority businesses is proportional to the minority 
        population: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates the Minority Business Development Agency 
        on its 45th anniversary;
            (2) commends the Minority Business Development Agency for 
        its achievements in fostering the establishment and growth of 
        minority businesses; and
            (3) encourages the Minority Business Development Agency to 
        continue its efforts to assist minority businesses as minority 
        businesses continue to strengthen communities, create jobs, and 
        contribute to the health of the economy of the United States.
