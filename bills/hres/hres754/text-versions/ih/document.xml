	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations and a signatory to both the Universal Declaration of
			 Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
			 among other international human rights treaties, without reservation;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in violation of these and other international obligations, officials of the Government of
			 Iran continue to perpetrate gross violations of the fundamental human
			 rights of the Iranian people;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Iranian women are increasingly subject to heinous acid attacks, either condoned by, or
			 sponsored by, the Government of Iran, through the Basij and other
			 vigilante groups;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Parliament of Iran recently enacted a law providing legal protection to private
			 citizens to enforce a strict Islamic dress code and other behavior
			 prescribed under Sharia law, emboldening the Basij and other vigilante
			 groups;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Iran <quote>manipulates the electoral process</quote>, according to the United States
			 Department of State’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2013,
			 <quote>severely limit[ing] citizens’ right to change their government peacefully
			 through free and fair elections</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas following voting irregularities that resulted in the election of President Mahmoud
			 Ahmadinejad, the Government of Iran brutally suppressed peaceful political
			 dissent from wide segments of civil society during the Green Revolution in
			 2009 in a cynical attempt to retain its undemocratic grip on power;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Iran has kept the principal leaders of the Green Revolution, Mir Hussein
			 Moussavi and Mehdi Karroubi, under house arrest since February 2011;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Department of State consistently finds that Iranian authorities have
			 <quote>limited freedom of association through threats, intimidation, the
			 imposition of arbitrary requirements on organizations, and the arrests of
			 group leaders and members</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Department of State’s Virtual Embassy Tehran website highlights human
			 rights violations and abuses in Iran on a weekly basis;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Iran continues to restrict freedom of speech and peaceful assembly,
			 particularly for journalists and human rights activists;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic
			 Republic of Iran found in its August 2014 report that the laws and
			 policies of the Government of Iran <quote>continue to place overly broad
			 restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression and access to
			 information</quote>, including <quote>severe content restrictions, intimidation and
			 prosecution of Internet users and limitations on Internet access through
			 throttling and filtering</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the ability of religious freedom and human rights activists to freely express themselves,
			 and mobilize civil society, is actively thwarted by the Government of
			 Iran;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Special Rapporteur found that the Government of Iran continues to apply capital
			 punishment to offenders convicted of crimes below the international human
			 rights law threshold of <quote>most serious crimes</quote>; political prisoners; and
			 juvenile offenders, including 8 individuals in 2014 believed to be less
			 than 18 years of age at the time of their alleged crimes;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Iranian women continue to face legal and societal discrimination, as well as rampant
			 domestic violence, which is not specifically prohibited under domestic
			 law;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on October 25, 2014, Iranian authorities executed Reyhaneh Jabbari, an Iranian woman
			 convicted of killing a man she said she stabbed in self-defense during a
			 sexual assault, an execution preceded by the lack of due process,
			 including a reported forced confession;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Department of State issued a statement condemning Jabbari’s execution and
			 calling on Iran to <quote>respect the fair trial guarantees afforded to its
			 people under Iran’s own laws and its international obligations</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom found in its 2014 Annual
			 Report that the Government of Iran <quote>continues to engage in systematic,
			 ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom, including
			 prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily or entirely
			 upon the religion of the accused</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Iran persecutes such religious minority groups as the Baha’is,
			 Christians, Sufi, Sunni, and dissenting Shi’a Muslims (such as imprisoned
			 Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi) through harassment, arrests, and
			 imprisonment, during which detainees have routinely been beaten, tortured,
			 and killed;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas since 1999, the United States Department of State has repeatedly designated Iran as a
			 <quote>country of particular concern</quote> for severe violations of religious freedom
			 pursuant to the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (Public Law
			 105–292), most recently on July 28, 2014;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Iran has long persecuted with particular intensity the Baha’i community,
			 the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran, who number at least
			 300,000, and are viewed as <quote>heretics</quote>, and therefore are subjected to
			 repression on the grounds of apostasy;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, since 1979,
			 Iranian authorities have killed or executed more than 200 Baha’i leaders;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas ordinary Iranian citizens who belong to the Baha'i faith are disproportionately targeted,
			 interrogated, and detained under the pretext of national security;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas senior governmental, military, and public security officials in Iran are responsible for
			 ordering, controlling, and committing gross human rights violations that,
			 in many cases, represent national policies of the Iranian regime;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Department of the Treasury, pursuant to section 413 of the Iran Threat
			 Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/22/8753">22 U.S.C. 8753</external-xref>), issued a
			 General License in September 2013 to permit the exportation of services
			 and the transfer of funds for activities related to human rights and
			 democracy building projects in Iran, which facilitate United States
			 nongovernmental organizations’ activities that increase Iranian access to
			 information and freedom of expression;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas since 2010, the United States Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the United
			 States Department of State, has sanctioned 19 Iranian officials and 18
			 Iranian entities for their involvement or complicity in serious human
			 rights abuses or in restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of
			 the Iranian people;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the most recent designation was for Morteza Tamaddom, former Governor-General of Tehran
			 Province, designated May 23, 2014, under Executive Order 13628 for his
			 involvement in censorship and other activities that limit the freedom of
			 expression and freedom of assembly of Iran’s citizens;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States led the effort in the United Nations Human Rights Council to renew the
			 mandate of the Special Rapporteur on Iran in order to further expose
			 Iranian human rights abuses; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas it is important that the President of the United States consistently and rigorously
			 exercise the statutory authorities granted by the Comprehensive Iran
			 Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 and the Iran Threat
			 Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 to impose sanctions on
			 officials of the Government of Iran and other individuals directly
			 responsible for human rights abuses, engaging in censorship, or engaging
			 in the diversion of goods intended for the people of Iran: Now, therefore,
			 be it</text>
