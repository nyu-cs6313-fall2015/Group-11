                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the designation of a week as National Federal Nurse 
                           Recognition Week.

Whereas the Federal Government has a mission to deliver quality care in its 
        delivery of health care services to patients in Federal health care 
        facilities in the United States;
Whereas Federal nurses are essential to providing quality, timely medical care 
        to millions of Americans who depend on federally funded health care 
        entities to maintain and restore good health;
Whereas the Department of Veterans Affairs is the largest employer of nurses in 
        the Nation and veterans rely on more than 80,000 nurses to provide care 
        in over 1,400 sites, including medical centers, outpatient clinics, 
        nursing homes and in veterans' homes;
Whereas military men and women and their families rely on nurses in the 
        Department of Defense civilian workforce to help deliver a range of 
        services, from caring for wounded warriors coming from the battlefield 
        to emergency rooms and hospitals to schools on military bases;
Whereas Federal nurses provide essential medical services to enable individuals 
        with disabilities in active duty and civilian status to live meaningful 
        and productive lives;
Whereas Federal nurses also provide the full range of nursing services to 
        inmates in Federal prisons, assisting in providing diagnostic and 
        therapeutic medical care and are also charged with maintaining security;
Whereas Federal nurses are regularly called upon to provide services in 
        extremely challenging environments, including periods of war and natural 
        disasters;
Whereas Federal nurses maintain their unwavering dedication and professional 
        competence in the face of growing demand for services;
Whereas recent advancements in Federal Government health care delivery systems 
        have resulted in higher acuity levels among active duty personnel, 
        veterans and the general patient population;
Whereas those changes highlight the critical need for safe nurse staffing 
        standards; improved quality measures to ensure patient safety; and 
        measures to prevent workplace injuries to Federal nurses and other 
        health care personnel;
Whereas the majority of Federal nurses are female and many are the sole 
        breadwinners of their families; and
Whereas it is in the national interest to have a robust and well-trained Federal 
        nurse workforce to meet growing health care needs: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of National Federal Nurse 
        Recognition Week;
            (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of Federal 
        nurses to maintaining and restoring the health of active duty 
        personnel and their families, veterans, and civilians of all 
        ages;
            (3) commends Federal nurses as integral in supporting the 
        Federal Government's mission to provide quality, accessible and 
        affordable health care; and
            (4) recognizes the need to ensure that we maintain an 
        adequate number of well-trained Federal nurses and provide them 
        with the support they need to provide the highest quality 
        patient care.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
