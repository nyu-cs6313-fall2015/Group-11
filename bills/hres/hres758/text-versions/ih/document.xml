	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas upon entering office in 2009, President Barack Obama announced his intention to <quote>reset</quote> relations with the Russian Federation, which was described by former United States Ambassador to
			 Russia Michael McFaul as a policy to <quote>engage with Russia to seek agreement on common interests</quote>, which included the negotiation of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) in which the
			 United States agreed to major reductions in its nuclear forces;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation has responded to this policy with openly anti-American rhetoric and
			 actions and with armed aggression against United States allies and partner
			 countries, including Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation has subjected Ukraine to a campaign of political, economic, and
			 military aggression for the purpose of establishing its domination over
			 the country and progressively erasing its independence;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation’s invasion of, and military operations on, Ukrainian territory
			 represent gross violations of Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and
			 territorial integrity and a violation of international law, including the
			 Russian Federation's obligations under the United Nations Charter;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation’s forcible occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea and its
			 continuing support for separatist and paramilitary forces in eastern
			 Ukraine are violations of its obligations under the 1994 Budapest
			 Memorandum on Security Assurances, in which it pledged to respect the
			 independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine and to
			 refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity
			 or political independence of Ukraine;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation has provided military equipment, training, and other assistance to
			 separatist and paramilitary forces in eastern Ukraine that has resulted in
			 over 4,000 civilian deaths, hundreds of thousands of civilian refugees,
			 and widespread destruction;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Ukrainian military remains at a significant disadvantage compared to the armed forces
			 of the Russian Federation in terms of size and technological
			 sophistication;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States strongly supports efforts to assist Ukraine to defend its territory and
			 sovereignty against military aggression by the Russian Federation and by
			 separatist forces;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the terms of the ceasefire specified in the Minsk Protocol that was signed on September 5,
			 2014, by representatives of the Government of Ukraine, the Russian
			 Federation, and the Russian-backed separatists in the eastern area of the
			 Ukraine have been repeatedly violated by the Russian Federation and the
			 separatist forces it supports;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas separatist forces in areas they controlled in eastern Ukraine prevented the holding of
			 elections on May 25, 2014, for a new President of Ukraine and on October
			 26, 2014, for a new Rada, thereby preventing the people of eastern Ukraine
			 from exercising their democratic right to select their candidates for
			 office in free and fair elections;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on November 2, 2014, separatist forces in eastern Ukraine held fraudulent and illegal
			 elections in areas they controlled for the supposed purpose of choosing
			 leaders of the illegitimate local political entities they have declared;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation has recognized the results of the illegal elections and continues to
			 provide the military, political, and economic support without which the
			 separatist forces could not continue to maintain their areas of control;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the reestablishment of peace and security in Ukraine requires the full withdrawal of
			 Russian forces from Ukrainian territory, the resumption of the
			 government’s control over all of the country’s international borders, the
			 disarming of the separatist and paramilitary forces in the east, an end to
			 Russia’s use of its energy exports and trade barriers to apply economic
			 and political pressure, and an end to Russian interference in Ukraine’s
			 internal affairs;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a civilian airliner, was destroyed by a Russian-made missile
			 provided by the Russian Federation to separatist forces in eastern
			 Ukraine, resulting in the loss of 298 innocent lives;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation has used and is continuing to use coercive economic measures,
			 including the manipulation of energy prices and supplies, as well as trade
			 restrictions, to place political and economic pressure on Ukraine;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas military forces of the Russian Federation and of the separatists it controls have
			 repeatedly violated the terms of the ceasefire agreement announced on
			 September 5, 2014;</text>
		</whereas><whereas commented="no"><text>Whereas the Russian Federation invaded the Republic of Georgia in August 2008, continues to station
			 military forces in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and is
			 implementing measures intended to progressively integrate these regions
			 into the Russian Federation;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation continues to subject the Republic of Georgia to political and
			 military intimidation, economic coercion, and other forms of aggression in
			 an effort to establish its control of the country and to prevent Georgia
			 from establishing closer relations with the European Union and the United
			 States;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation continues to station military forces in the Transniestria region of
			 Moldova;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation continues to provide support to the illegal separatist regime in the
			 Transniestria region of Moldova;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation continues to subject Moldova to political and military intimidation,
			 economic coercion, and other forms of aggression in an effort to establish
			 its control of the countries and to prevent efforts by Moldova to
			 establish closer relations with the European Union and the United States;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas under the terms of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), a flight-test or
			 deployment of any INF-banned weapon delivery vehicle by the Russian
			 Federation constitutes a violation of the INF Treaty;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on July 29, 2014, the United States Department of State released its report on the
			 Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and
			 Disarmament Agreements and Commitments, as required by Section 403 of the
			 Arms Control and Disarmament Act, for calendar year 2013, which found
			 that, <quote>[t]he United States has determined that the Russian Federation is in violation of its obligations
			 under the INF Treaty not to possess, produce, or flight-test a
			 ground-launched cruise missile (GLCM) with a range capability of 500 km to
			 5,500 km, or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to reports, the Government of the Russian Federation has repeatedly engaged in
			 the infiltration of, and attacks on, computer networks of the United
			 States Government, as well as individuals and private entities, for the
			 purpose of illicitly acquiring information and disrupting operations,
			 including by supporting Russian individuals and entities engaged in these
			 actions;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the political, military, and economic aggression against Ukraine and other countries by the
			 Russian Federation underscores the enduring importance of the North
			 Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as the cornerstone of collective
			 Euro-Atlantic defense;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States reaffirms its obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, especially
			 Article 5 which states that <quote>an armed attack against one or more</quote> of the treaty signatories <quote>shall be considered an attack against them all</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation is continuing to use its supply of energy as a means of political
			 and economic coercion against Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and other
			 European countries;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States strongly supports energy diversification initiatives in Ukraine, Georgia,
			 Moldova, and other European countries to reduce the ability of the Russian
			 Federation to use its supply of energy for political and economic
			 coercion, including the development of domestic sources of energy,
			 increased efficiency, and substituting Russian energy resources with
			 imports from other countries;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation continues to conduct an aggressive propaganda effort in Ukraine in
			 which false information is used to subvert the authority of the legitimate
			 national government, undermine stability, promote ethnic dissension, and
			 incite violence;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation has expanded the presence of its state-sponsored media in national
			 languages across central and western Europe with the intent of using news
			 and information to distort public opinion and obscure Russian political
			 and economic influence in Europe;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas expanded efforts by United States international broadcasting across all media in the
			 Russian and Ukrainian languages are needed to counter Russian propaganda
			 and to provide the people of Ukraine and the surrounding regions with
			 access to credible and balanced information;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Incorporated continue to
			 represent a minority market share in Ukraine and other regional states
			 with significant ethno-linguistic Russian populations who increasingly
			 obtain their local and international news from Russian state-sponsored
			 media outlets;</text>
		</whereas><whereas commented="no"><text>Whereas the United States International Programming to Ukraine and Neighboring Regions Act of 2014
			 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/113/96">Public Law 113–96</external-xref>) requires the Voice of America and RFE/RL, Incorporated
			 to
			 provide programming content to target populations in Ukraine and Moldova
			 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including at least 8 weekly hours of total
			 original video and television content and 14 weekly hours of total audio
			 content while expanding cooperation with local media outlets and deploying
			 greater content through multimedia platforms and mobile devices; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Vladimir Putin has established an increasingly authoritarian regime in the Russian
			 Federation through fraudulent elections, the persecution and jailing of
			 political opponents, the elimination of independent media, the seizure of
			 key sectors of the economy and enabling supporters to enrich themselves
			 through widespread corruption, and implementing a strident propaganda
			 campaign to justify Russian aggression against other countries and
			 repression in Russia, among other actions: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
