                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring the life and legacy of Vaclav Havel by directing the House of 
Representatives Fine Arts Board to provide for the display of a bust of 
               Vaclav Havel in the United States Capitol.

Whereas Vaclav Havel, former President of the Czech Republic, passed away on 
        December 18, 2011, at 75 years of age, at his country home in Hradecek 
        in the Czech Republic;
Whereas Vaclav Havel is widely recognized and respected throughout the world as 
        a defender of democratic principles and human rights;
Whereas through his extensive writings, Vaclav Havel courageously challenged the 
        ideology and legitimacy of the authoritarian communist regimes that 
        ruled Central and Eastern Europe during the Cold War;
Whereas Vaclav Havel, who was imprisoned multiple times by the Communist Party 
        of Czechoslovakia for his advocacy of universal human rights and 
        democratic principles, maintained his convictions in the face of 
        repression;
Whereas Vaclav Havel was one of the founders of Charter 77, a group of 242 
        individuals who called for the human rights guaranteed under the 1975 
        Helsinki accords to be realized in Czechoslovakia;
Whereas Vaclav Havel was a cofounder of the Committee for the Defense of the 
        Unjustly Prosecuted, an organization dedicated to supporting dissidents 
        and their families which helped to advance the cause of freedom and 
        justice in Czechoslovakia;
Whereas Vaclav Havel, as leader of the Civic Forum movement, was a key figure in 
        the 1989 ``Velvet Revolution'', the peaceful overthrow of the 
        Czechoslovakia communist government;
Whereas, on February 21, 1990, Vaclav Havel addressed a Joint Session of 
        Congress where he stated, ``Thomas Jefferson wrote that `governments are 
        instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the 
        governed'. It was a simple and important act of the human spirit. What 
        gave meaning to that act, however, was that the author backed it up with 
        his life. It was not just his words but it was his deeds as well.'';
Whereas following the Velvet Revolution, Vaclav Havel was democratically elected 
        as President of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic in 1990, and after 
        a peaceful partition forming 2 separate states, democratically elected 
        President of the Czech Republic in 1993;
Whereas under the leadership of Vaclav Havel, the Czech Republic became a 
        prosperous, democratic country and a respected member of the 
        international community;
Whereas also under his leadership the Czech Republic became a member of the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on March 12, 1999, and 
        continues to be a valued ally of the United States;
Whereas during his lifetime, Vaclav Havel received praise as one of the world's 
        great democratic leaders and was awarded many international prizes 
        recognizing his commitment to peace and democratic principles;
Whereas, on July 23, 2003, President George W. Bush honored Vaclav Havel with 
        the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the 
        United States Government, for being ``one of liberty's great heroes'';
Whereas after leaving office as president of the Czech Republic in February 
        2003, Vaclav Havel remained a voice on behalf of democratic dissidents 
        worldwide and against authoritarian regimes; and
Whereas the legacy of Vaclav Havel inspires those that advocate and work for 
        freedom from tyranny: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That to honor the life and legacy of Vaclav Havel, the 
House of Representatives Fine Arts Board shall provide for the display 
of an appropriate bust of Vaclav Havel in the House of Representatives 
wing of the United States Capitol.
