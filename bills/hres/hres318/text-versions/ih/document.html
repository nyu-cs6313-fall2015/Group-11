                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing disapproval over the gun violence plaguing America's 
  communities, and calling on the Congress to enact comprehensive gun 
                   reforms that reduce gun violence.

Whereas more than 31,000 people a year in the United States die from gunshot 
        wounds;
Whereas, in 2010, there were an estimated 337,960 nonfatal violent crimes 
        committed with guns, and 73,505 persons treated in hospital emergency 
        departments for nonfatal gunshot wounds;
Whereas the burden of gun violence on American society is substantial when 
        measured in years of productive life lost, disability, fear, and 
        economic costs;
Whereas, in 2005, gun-related deaths and injuries in the United States resulted 
        in medical and lost productivity expenses estimated at $37,000,000,000;
Whereas the use of guns is the second leading cause of traumatic death related 
        to a consumer product in the United States, and is the second most 
        frequent cause of death overall for Americans ages 15 to 24;
Whereas gun violence is the leading cause of death for African-American teens;
Whereas women who are victims of domestic violence are 5 times more likely to be 
        killed if their abuser has a gun;
Whereas tragedies at schools, such as Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, and Columbine 
        bring to the forefront the need to protect our most vulnerable citizens, 
        our children, and school personnel from gun violence;
Whereas similar events have taken place in public areas, such as the Century 
        Movie Theater in Aurora, work places around the Nation, and Fort Hood, 
        which is considered a secure environment;
Whereas stand-your-ground laws have dramatically and recklessly expanded the 
        right of citizens to use deadly force, and have been subject to national 
        scrutiny;
Whereas there has been widespread support among gun owners and non-gun owners 
        for commonsense gun reforms that include banning assault weapons and 
        high capacity magazine clips of more than 10 rounds, reporting the sale 
        of large quantities of ammunition to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
        Firearms and Explosives, and requiring background checks on all gun 
        purchasers, including those purchasing at gun shows; and
Whereas the President of the United States has issued executive actions based on 
        the recommendations of a study commission on gun violence, to promote 
        fact-based, commonsense legislation which would protect the rights and 
        freedom of all citizens: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the President's Plan to Reduce Gun Violence 
        based on the study commission's recommendations;
            (2) urges the Congress to enact legislation based on the 
        recommendations of the President to reduce gun violence;
            (3) condemns all gun violence and relevant parties for 
        their role in obstructing communities ability to be safe from 
        gun violence;
            (4) condemns all efforts to weaken gun laws and proposals 
        that stand in the way of comprehensive gun law reform;
            (5) condemns all relevant parties for their roles in 
        proposing stand-your-ground legislation and similar legislation 
        that compromises public safety and the integrity of the 
        prosecutorial system;
            (6) urges any State legislature considering stand-your-
        ground legislation to reject such proposals; and
            (7) urges the repeal of the stand-your-ground law in every 
        State which has enacted such a law.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
