		<whereas><text>Whereas personal financial literacy is essential to ensuring that individuals are prepared to make
			 informed decisions about financial planning, wealth accumulation, higher

			 complex financial marketplace;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas personal financial management skills begin to develop during childhood;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the move away from traditional pensions to defined contribution plans requires more
			 financial education, so workers need to be equipped with the financial
			 aptitude to not only save and accumulate assets, but they need to be
			 prepared to turn those savings into lifetime income;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Council for Economic Education found that only 16 States require that some sort of
			 personal finance education be offered in high schools and only 15 States
			 require that course for graduation;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a bi-annual study by the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy found that
			 only 5 percent of high school seniors and only 25 percent of graduating
			 college students can be considered financially literate;</text>

			 are obtaining credit cards and the average graduating college student has
			 a credit card debt of $4,100;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a longitudinal research study by the University of Arizona found that high school and
			 college students who have been exposed to ongoing financial education show
			 an increase in financial knowledge;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created to educate consumers and help them
			 make better-informed financial decisions by helping make the financial
			 markets safer for consumers, increasing transparency to enable individuals
			 to compare products and make informed decisions and promote policies that
			 help consumers improve their financial knowledge and capability;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Bureau issued a report in 2013 that included a number of recommendations to improve
			 financial literacy for students;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas section 342 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act directs the
			 Federal financial regulatory agencies to partner with industry
			 organizations and high schools in targeted areas to help promote financial
			 literacy and create <quote>industry internships, summer employment and full-time positions</quote> for talented minorities and women;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the 2012 National Financial Capability Study, developed in consultation with the Department
			 of the Treasury and President Obama’s Advisory Council on Financial
			 Capability, updates key measures from the 2009 National Financial
			 Capability Study of American adults and deepens the exploration of topics
			 that are highly relevant today, including student loans and medical debt;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Money as You Learn Initiative, a coalition of non-profit and for profit organizations,
			 teachers, and academics, provides concrete tools for educators to show how
			 personal finance can provide appropriate context and content for
			 mathematics and English language arts teaching;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Federal Reserve offers publications in English and Spanish that provide consumers tips
			 on a broad range of topics, from avoiding mortgage foreclosure scams to
			 managing a checking account; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a study entitled Financial Literacy, Financial Education and Downstream Financial
			 Behaviors, conducted by Daniel Fernandes, John G. Lynch, Jr., and Richard
			 Netemeyer, found that it <quote>is best to provide assistance just before a decision is made in what is known as <quote>just-in-time
			 education</quote></quote>: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
