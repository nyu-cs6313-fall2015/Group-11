                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the President of the United States and the executive branch 
    of Government for continuous actions that violate the laws and 
                   Constitution of the United States.

Whereas the President violated the Constitution by unilaterally changing 
        sections of the Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) 23 times 
        without congressional approval;
Whereas the President and the Department of Justice, in direct violation of 
        their constitutional responsibility, decided to not enforce Federal law 
        with regards to the Defense of Marriage Act (Public Law 104-199);
Whereas the President and the Department of Justice continues to choose not to 
        enforce Federal drug laws (Public Law 91-513, the Controlled Substances 
        Act, and Public Law 100-690, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986);
Whereas the President violated the Constitution by making presidential 
        appointments to the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer 
        Financial Protection Bureau while Congress was not in session;
Whereas the President and the Department of Justice abused executive privilege 
        with regards to the Operation Fast and Furious scandal, by refusing to 
        comply with a subpoena issued by the Committee on Oversight and 
        Government Reform of the House of Representatives in violation of 
        section 192 of title 2, United States Code;
Whereas the President violated the law (Public Law 89-236) when he unilaterally 
        changed our Nation's immigration laws with regards to Deferred Action;
Whereas the President and the Department of Health and Human Services failed to 
        enforce Federal law (Public Law 111-5) by illegally waiving the work 
        requirement for welfare recipients;
Whereas the Internal Revenue Service violated the First Amendment to the United 
        States Constitution by targeting non-profit organizations because of 
        their religious or political beliefs;
Whereas the President and the Department of Defense knowingly violated the 
        National Defense Authorization Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-66) by not 
        providing a 30-day notice to Congress prior to transporting five 
        Guantanamo detainees to Qatar in a prisoner swap;
Whereas article II, section 3 of the United States Constitution states in 
        pertinent part that the President ``shall take care that the Laws be 
        faithfully executed.''; and
Whereas the House of Representatives reiterates its authority to impeach any 
        president for failing to faithfully enforce the laws of the land or for 
        violating the law: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the President and the executive branch of 
        Government for actions and acts that are beyond the clearly 
        defined laws of the United States;
            (2) calls on the President and the executive branch of 
        Government to adhere to the Constitution and halt all unlawful 
        and illegal actions which circumvent Congress and violate the 
        Constitution; and
            (3) calls on the President and the executive branch of 
        Government to respect the constitutionally defined separation 
        of powers.
                                 <all>
