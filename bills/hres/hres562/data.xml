  <summary>7/25/2014--Passed House amended.
Reaffirms that it is U.S. policy to support the Republic of Moldova's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity.

 Supports the Strategic Dialogue as a means to strengthen relations between the Republic of Moldova and the United States and enhance the democratic, economic, rule of law, and security reforms being implemented by the Republic of Moldova.

 Encourages the President and the Department of State to enhance U.S. cooperation with the government of Moldova and civil society organizations.

Affirms the Republic of Moldova's sovereign right to determine its own partnerships free of external coercion and affirms Moldova's right to associate with the European Union (EU) or any regional organization.

Calls upon the Government of Russia to: (1) withdraw its military forces from within the internationally recognized territory of the Republic of Moldova, (2) refrain from economic threats, and (3) cease actions that support separatist movements in Moldova.

Supports: (1) confidence-building measures between the government of Moldova and the authorities in the Transnistria region in order to secure a peaceful resolution to the conflict; and (2) efforts to resolve the Transnistria issue through a settlement that affirms Moldova's sovereignty and territorial integrity, while providing a special status for the Transnistrian region within Moldova.

Urges officials in the Transnistrian region to allow Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe monitors unrestricted access to the region.

Affirms that lasting stability and security in Europe is a key U.S. priority that can only be achieved if the territorial integrity and sovereignty of all European countries is respected.</summary>
