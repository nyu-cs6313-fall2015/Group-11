Lerner, former IRS Director, Exempt Organizations, and the ongoing disclosure of internal communications showing potentially unlawful conduct by executive branch personnel; (4) given DOJ's conflict of interest, as well as the strong public interest in ensuring that public officials who inappropriately targeted American citizens for exercising their right to free expression are held accountable, appointment of a special counsel would be in the public interest; and (5) Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr., should appoint a special counsel, without further delay, to investigate the targeting of conservative nonprofit advocacy groups by the IRS."
