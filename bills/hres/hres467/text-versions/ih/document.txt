                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of February 12, 2014, as ``Darwin 
 Day'' and recognizing the importance of science in the betterment of 
                               humanity.

Whereas Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by the mechanism of natural 
        selection, together with the monumental amount of scientific evidence he 
        compiled to support it, provides humanity with a logical and 
        intellectually compelling explanation for the diversity of life on 
        Earth;
Whereas the validity of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is 
        further strongly supported by the modern understanding of the science of 
        genetics;
Whereas it has been the human curiosity and ingenuity exemplified by Darwin that 
        has promoted new scientific discoveries that have helped humanity solve 
        many problems and improve living conditions;
Whereas the advancement of science must be protected from those unconcerned with 
        the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change;
Whereas the teaching of creationism in some public schools compromises the 
        scientific and academic integrity of the United States education 
        systems;
Whereas Charles Darwin is a worthy symbol of scientific advancement on which to 
        focus and around which to build a global celebration of science and 
        humanity intended to promote a common bond among all of Earth's peoples; 
        and
Whereas February 12, 2014, is the anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin in 
        1809 and would be an appropriate date to designate as ``Darwin Day'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Darwin Day''; and
            (2) recognizes Charles Darwin as a worthy symbol on which 
        to celebrate the achievements of reason, science, and the 
        advancement of human knowledge.
                                 <all>
