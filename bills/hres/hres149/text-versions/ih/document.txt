                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of April as Parkinson's Awareness 
                                 Month.

Whereas Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive, neurological disease and 
        is the second most common neurological disease in the United States;
Whereas there is inadequate comprehensive data on the incidence and prevalence 
        of Parkinson's disease;
Whereas it is estimated that the disease affects 500,000 to 1,500,000 people in 
        the United States and the prevalence will more than double by 2040;
Whereas there are millions of people in the United States who are caregivers, 
        family members, and friends greatly impacted by Parkinson's disease 
        every day;
Whereas it is estimated that the economic burden of Parkinson's disease is 
        $14,400,000,000 including indirect costs to patients and family members 
        of $6,300,000,000 each year;
Whereas although research suggests the cause of Parkinson's disease is a 
        combination of genetic and environmental factors, the exact cause and 
        progression of the disease is still unknown;
Whereas there is no objective test or biomarker for Parkinson's disease, and the 
        rate of misdiagnosis can be high;
Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from person to person and 
        include tremors, slowness of movement, difficulty with balance, 
        swallowing, chewing, speaking, rigidity, cognitive impairment, dementia, 
        mood disorders (such as depression and anxiety) constipation, skin 
        problems, and sleep difficulties;
Whereas there is no cure, therapy, or drug to slow or halt the progression of 
        Parkinson's disease;
Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson's disease for a limited 
        amount of time each day, often with dose-limiting side effects, and 
        ultimately lose their effectiveness, leaving the person unable to move, 
        speak, or swallow;
Whereas increased education and research are needed to find more effective 
        treatments with fewer side effects and, ultimately, an effective 
        treatment or cure for Parkinson's disease; and
Whereas April would be an appropriate month to designate as Parkinson's 
        Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of Parkinson's Awareness 
        Month;
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkinson's Awareness 
        Month;
            (3) continues to support research to find better 
        treatments, and eventually, a cure for Parkinson's disease;
            (4) recognizes the people living with Parkinson's who 
        participate in vital clinical trials to advance the knowledge 
        of the disease; and
            (5) commends the dedication of State, local, regional, and 
        national organizations, volunteers, researchers, and millions 
        of people in the United States working to improve the quality 
        of life of persons living with Parkinson's disease and their 
        families.
                                 <all>
