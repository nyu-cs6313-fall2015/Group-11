                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of 
  fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United 
            States and throughout the world for their faith.

Whereas since the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, 
        threats and incidents of violence have been directed at law-abiding, 
        patriotic Americans of African, Arab, and South Asian descent, 
        particularly members of the Islamic faith;
Whereas, on September 14, 2001, the House of Representatives passed a concurrent 
        resolution condemning bigotry and violence against Arab-Americans, 
        American Muslims, and Americans from South Asia in the wake of the 
        terrorist attacks;
Whereas it is estimated that there are approximately 1,600,000,000 Muslims 
        worldwide;
Whereas over 3,600 Muslims serve on active duty and over 1,700 Muslims serve as 
        selected reserve personnel in the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas Ramadan is the holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal for Muslims 
        worldwide, and is the 9th month of the Muslim calendar year; and
Whereas the observance of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan commences at dusk on 
        July 8, 2013, and continues for one lunar month: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) during this time of conflict, in order to demonstrate 
        solidarity with and support for members of the community of 
        Islam in the United States and throughout the world, the House 
        of Representatives recognizes the Islamic faith as one of the 
        great religions of the world; and
            (2) in observance of and out of respect for the 
        commencement of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting and 
        spiritual renewal, the House of Representatives acknowledges 
        the onset of Ramadan and expresses its deepest respect to 
        Muslims in the United States and throughout the world on this 
        significant occasion.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
