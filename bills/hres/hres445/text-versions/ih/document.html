                               RESOLUTION


 
Urging the P5+1 to only accept a final nuclear agreement with Iran that 
definitively prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, 
ceases Iran's construction of advanced missiles and warheads, suspends 
 Iran's support for terrorist organizations, and reduces human rights 
                        violations within Iran.

Whereas a nuclear-capable Iran threatens United States national security and 
        global stability;
Whereas since at least the late 1980s, Iran has engaged in a sustained and well-
        documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities to acquire a 
        nuclear weapons capability;
Whereas United States policy is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons 
        capability;
Whereas in November 2013, the P5+1 and Iran announced an interim nuclear 
        agreement and the intent to reach a final comprehensive agreement over 
        Iran's nuclear program;
Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted multiple resolutions 
        since 2006 demanding of Iran its full and sustained suspension of all 
        uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities and its full 
        cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on all 
        outstanding issues related to its nuclear activities, particularly those 
        concerning the possible military dimensions of its nuclear programs;
Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry has publicly stated that the United States 
        does not recognize Iran's self-proclaimed right to enrich uranium;
Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted multiple resolutions 
        demanding of Iran its full and sustained suspension of heavy-water 
        production efforts, including the heavy-water reactor at Arak;
Whereas Iran routinely denies international inspectors access to suspected 
        nuclear and weapons-testing facilities in violation of international 
        agreements, including the Parchin military complex;
Whereas Iran is developing an arsenal of advanced long-range ballistic missiles, 
        including some already capable of reaching India, North Africa, western 
        China, and parts of eastern Europe, and is expected to be able to 
        flight-test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of 
        reaching the United States by 2015;
Whereas, on June 9, 2010, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 
        1929, which states that ``Iran shall not undertake any activity related 
        to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.'';
Whereas the United States Department of State has designated Iran as a state 
        sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and has characterized Iran as the ``most 
        active state sponsor of terrorism'' in the world;
Whereas Iran is a world leader in human rights violations, including the 
        persecution of religious minorities and imprisonment of United States 
        citizens; and
Whereas economic sanctions have brought Iran's economy to the brink of collapse, 
        forcing the Government of Iran to enter serious negotiations over Iran's 
        nuclear program: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) reaffirms its commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring 
        a nuclear weapons capability, which threatens United States 
        national security and global stability;
            (2) declares that Iran should completely dismantle all 
        enrichment facilities and cease all centrifuge production;
            (3) declares that Iran should completely dismantle its 
        heavy-water plutonium reactor at Arak and cease all heavy-water 
        production efforts;
            (4) declares that Iran should allow constant, intrusive 
        inspections and monitoring of all nuclear and weapons-testing 
        facilities and fully implement the Additional Protocol to the 
        nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT);
            (5) declares that Iran should cease the development, 
        production, and testing of long-range ballistic missiles;
            (6) declares that Iran should cease and dismantle the 
        development of a nuclear warhead and cease other weaponization 
        efforts;
            (7) declares that Iran should suspend its support for 
        terrorist organizations including Hamas and Hezbollah, as well 
        as the Assad regime in Syria;
            (8) declares that Iran should take dramatic steps to 
        significantly reduce human rights violations, including the 
        persecution of religious minorities and unjust imprisonment of 
        innocent United States citizens; and
            (9) reaffirms the need for additional economic sanctions 
        against Iran should it fail to meet the negotiated terms of the 
        interim agreement within six months of implementing the deal.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
