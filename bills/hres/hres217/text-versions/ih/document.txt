                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Federal, 
State, and local police officers who have fallen while fulfilling their 
duty both in Michigan and the United States should be honored for their 
         sacrifice and commitment to preserving law and order.

Whereas the week of May 12, 2013, through May 18, 2013, has been designated as 
        ``National Police Week'';
Whereas the brave men and women who serve on the Federal, State, and local 
        levels put themselves in harm's way to protect and preserve the safety 
        and security of law-abiding citizens on a daily basis;
Whereas in 2012 alone, at least 120 Federal, State, and local police officers 
        died in the line of duty while fulfilling their oath to uphold the law; 
        and
Whereas in Michigan, 564 known police officers have died in the line of duty 
        since 1791: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Federal, State, and local police officers who have fallen while 
fulfilling their duty both in Michigan and the United States should be 
honored for their sacrifice and commitment to preserving law and order.
                                 <all>
