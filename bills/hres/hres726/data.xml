  <summary>9/17/2014--Passed House without amendment.
Supports the right of the people of Ukraine to determine their future, including their country's relationship with other nations and international organizations, without interference or coercion by other countries.

Calls on the President to work with nations around the world to reaffirm Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity and to refuse to recognize the Russian Federation's illegal annexation of Crimea.

Condemns the Russian Federation's political, economic, and military aggression against Ukraine and the violation of its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity.

States that the Russian Federation's military intervention:

 is a breach of its obligations under the United Nations (U.N.) Charter and its commitments under the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe; is a violation of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances in which it pledged to respect Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and borders; and poses a threat to international peace and security. Demands that the Russian Federation: (1) remove its military forces and military equipment from the territory of Ukraine; and (2) end its political, military, and economic support of separatist and paramilitary forces in Ukraine.

Demands that the Russian Federation and the separatist and paramilitary forces it supports end their violations of the cease-fire announced on September 5, 2014.

Calls on the President to:

 cooperate with other nations around the world to impose visa bans, targeted asset freezes, sectoral sanctions, and other measures on the Russian Federation and its leadership sufficient to compel it to end its violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity; provide the government of Ukraine with defense articles, services, training, and intelligence information; work with the government of Ukraine, other nations, and international organizations to ensure that the multinational team investigating the destruction of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 is able to conduct an unrestricted investigation and to ensure that those responsible for this tragedy are brought to justice; and expand U.S. international broadcasting efforts to Russian-speaking audiences in Ukraine and inside and outside of Russia. Calls on our European allies, other countries, and international organizations to join the United States in assisting the government of Ukraine to ensure that the parliamentary elections scheduled for October 26, 2014, are held in all regions of Ukraine in accordance with international standards.

Calls on Ukraine and other countries to support energy diversification initiatives to reduce the Russian Federation's ability to use its energy exports as a means of applying political or economic pressure.

Reaffirms the commitment of the United States to its obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and calls on member states to provide their full share of the resources needed to ensure their collective defense.</summary>
