	<preamble><whereas><text>Whereas, on May 11, 2013, in Kabul, Afghanistan, United States Deputy Secretary of State William
			 Burns stated: <quote>a successful political transition is an essential prerequisite for sustainable security. It is
			 vitally important that the elections next April be transparent, credible,
			 and inclusive.</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on July 9, 2013, the United States Senate unanimously agreed to S. Res. 151: <quote>A resolution urging the Government of Afghanistan to ensure transparent and credible presidential
			 and provincial elections in April 2014 by adhering to internationally
			 accepted democratic standards, establishing a transparent electoral
			 process, and ensuring security for voters and candidates.</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on April 5, 2014, the Government of Afghanistan held the first round of a presidential
			 election;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on May 15, 2014, the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan (<quote>IEC</quote>) certified the results of the national election held 40 days prior, and announced a run-off
			 election date of June 14, 2014, for the two top presidential candidate
			 vote
			 recipients;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas voter participation increased from approximately 35 percent in the 2009 Afghan presidential
			 election to almost 60 percent for the election held on April 5, 2014, and
			 the percentage of newly registered female voters slightly increased;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the 2009 Afghan presidential election experienced low female voter turnout due to the
			 insufficient number of female poll workers, and the United Nations
			 Development Programme’s Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan approved
			 a Ministry of Interior request to fund the hiring of 13,000 female
			 election security officers in order to bolster female voter turnout for
			 the 2014 presidential election—but 40 out of Afghanistan’s 407 districts
			 still did not have female election staff due to security concerns;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 27 Afghans were killed on election day in 2009, and 17 members of the Afghan National
			 Security Forces (<quote>ANSF</quote>) were killed over the course of nearly 300 insurgent attacks carried out during the election held
			 on April 5, 2014;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas after the 2009 Afghan presidential election, the Independent Electoral Complaints
			 Commission
			 (<quote>IECC</quote>) ordered the results from 210 polling stations be invalidated, and later, after investigating 579
			 more polling stations quarantined by the IEC, found that all but 18 of
			 those should be excluded as well—and on May 14, 2014, the IEC, based on
			 IECC decisions, invalidated the results from 331 polling stations during
			 the 2014 election and removed them from the final tabulation;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, to date, 809,349 votes cast for the first place presidential candidate,  165,339 votes
			 cast for the second place presidential candidate, and 39,555 votes cast
			 for the third place presidential candidate during the June 14, 2014,
			 election have been invalidated for fraud;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there have been widespread reports of voter and election monitor 
intimidation, as well as attempts to bribe members of the IEC, the IECC, and other election
			 monitoring organizations;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas vote counting by the IEC was performed behind closed doors instead of 
in front of international monitors, and information was leaked to some 
candidates but not others;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas investigations by the IECC, and their coordination with the IEC, have not 
been conducted in a transparent manner;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Government of Afghanistan eliminated text messaging capabilities the 
evening prior to the 2014 presidential election until 5:00 p.m. on election day—greatly inhibiting
			 monitoring efforts by international organizations—explaining that the
			 decision was made in response to two candidates sending more than one
			 million text messages during the <quote>silent period</quote> and to combat further advertising—an explanation denied by the Chairman of the IEC who requested
			 that texting capabilities be restored;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas members of the National Democratic Institute (<quote>NDI</quote>) were killed during 
an attack at the Serena Hotel in Kabul on March 20, 2014, causing NDI to remove significant numbers
			 of staff from Afghanistan and spreading fear among other monitors;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a run-off date of June 14, 2014, means the snows will have melted across 
Afghanistan, allowing the Taliban to move more freely, leading to a greater chance of disruption
			 during the run-off presidential election;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas some candidates, and some campaign staff, have proclaimed that should 
their opponents prevail, Afghanistan will be a less secure nation in which more civilians will
			 die—thereby creating a climate that is not conducive to democratic
			 transition;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas some polling places used the entirety of their allotted 600 ballots in one to two hours
			 leading some candidates, or their representatives, to call for more
			 ballots—even though it is highly implausible that so many ballots could be
			 exhausted in such a short time; and</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States contributed approximately $175 million toward
conducting the 2009 Afghan presidential election, and will contribute approximately $200 million
			 toward the 2014 Afghan presidential election: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble><resolution-body id="H9BE5E8B33203431C9D90001BE1EFB8B3" style="traditional">
