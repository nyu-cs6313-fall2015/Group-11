                               RESOLUTION


 
   Commending Korean American veterans of the Vietnam War for their 
                     service to the United States.

Whereas Korean veterans of the Vietnam War served honorably throughout the 
        conflict, fighting courageously alongside the United States Armed Forces 
        and often making the ultimate sacrifice, with many later becoming United 
        States citizens;
Whereas the United States holds as its highest ideals freedom, democracy, and 
        self-determination;
Whereas during the Vietnam War, more than 3,000,000 members of the United States 
        Armed Forces fought bravely to preserve and defend these ideals with 
        some still missing in action;
Whereas 58,193 members of the United States Armed Forces were killed, more than 
        300,000 were wounded, and 2,000 are missing in action;
Whereas soldiers from the Republic of Korea were sent to the Vietnam War to 
        support the United States Armed Forces and the cause of freedom at the 
        request of the United States;
Whereas 325,517 Korean soldiers served in Vietnam from 1964 until the last 
        soldier left Saigon on March 23, 1973, making Korean soldiers the second 
        largest contingent of troops sent by allies of the United States;
Whereas Korean troops fought bravely throughout the theater and were known for 
        their dedication, tenacity, and effectiveness on the battlefield;
Whereas 5,099 Korean soldiers were killed and 10,962 Korean soldiers were 
        injured, many in defense of United States friends and allies;
Whereas it is estimated that 20 percent of Korean veterans of the Vietnam War 
        suffer from significant injuries including post-traumatic stress 
        disorder, total disability, and the effects of the toxic defoliant Agent 
        Orange; and
Whereas Korean American veterans of the Vietnam War honorably upheld the highest 
        ideals of the United States through their dedicated service and 
        considerable sacrifices: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives commends Korean 
American veterans of the Vietnam War for their service to the United 
States.
