H. RES. 732

  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that mandates 
imposed on manufacturers requiring inclusion of unproven and unreliable 
 technology in firearms is costly and punitive, and the prohibition of 
  firearms without such features is an infringement on the rights of 
                  citizens under the Second Amendment.

  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that mandates 
imposed on manufacturers requiring inclusion of unproven and unreliable 
 technology in firearms is costly and punitive, and the prohibition of 
  firearms without such features is an infringement on the rights of 
                  citizens under the Second Amendment.

Whereas California has implemented a law requiring firearms manufacturers to 
        micro laser-engrave a gun's make, model, and serial number on two or 
        more internal parts of each semiautomatic pistol so that, in theory, the 
        information is imprinted on the cartridge casing in two locations when 
        the firearm is fired;
Whereas other States and the District of Columbia are considering similar 
        mandates;
Whereas based on the current state of this nascent technology, it is impossible 
        to microstamp a firearm in two locations and have the required 
        identifying information imprinted on the cartridge casing when fired;
Whereas the scientific literature concludes there is no existing microstamping 
        technology that will reliably, consistently, and legibly imprint the 
        required identifying information from the tip of the firing pin of a 
        semi-automatic pistol on to the cartridge casing it fires;
Whereas one study found that the impressions were not decipherable nearly 50 
        percent of the time;
Whereas the holder of the patent for the technology was a coauthor of peer-
        reviewed study that concluded, ``legitimate questions exist related to 
        both the technical aspects, production costs, and database management 
        associated with microstamping that should be addressed before wide scale 
        implementation is legislatively mandated'';
Whereas a subsequent study noted the use of expensive scanning electron 
        microscope (SEM) technology still failed to solve the problems 
        associated with microstamping;
Whereas the microstamping process is costly and time-consuming, and threatens 
        the employment of thousands in the firearms industry;
Whereas the passage of legislation requiring its use would raise the cost of 
        legal firearms by well over $200 per gun for both law-abiding citizens 
        seeking to exercise their Second Amendment right and for United States 
        law enforcement personnel; and
Whereas manufacturers have publicly stated it is impossible for any manufacturer 
        to comply with the provisions of the California law which are invalid, 
        that cannot be enforced, and that will not contribute to improving 
        public safety: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) mandates imposed on manufacturers requiring inclusion 
        of unproven and unreliable microstamping technology in firearms 
        is costly and punitive; and
            (2) the prohibition of firearms without such features is an 
        infringement on the rights of citizens under the Second 
        Amendment.
