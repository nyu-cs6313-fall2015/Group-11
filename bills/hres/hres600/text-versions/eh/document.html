H. Res. 600

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                          June 9, 2014.
Whereas on April 5, 2014, the Government of Afghanistan held the first round of 
        the presidential election in which voter participation was 60 percent;
Whereas on May 15, 2014, Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission (IEC) 
        certified the results, and announced that a run-off election would be 
        held on June 14, 2014, because no candidate received more than 50 
        percent of the votes;
Whereas on May 14, 2014, the IEC invalidated votes from 331 polling stations and 
        removed them from the final tabulation, based on Electoral Complaints 
        Commission (ECC) decisions;
Whereas there have been widespread reports of voter and election monitor 
        intimidation, including the killing of members of the National 
        Democratic Institute (NDI) during an attack at the Serena Hotel in Kabul 
        on March 20, 2014, as well as attempts to bribe members of the IEC, the 
        ECC, and other election monitoring organizations;
Whereas investigations by the ECC, and its coordination with the IEC, have not 
        been conducted in a transparent manner;
Whereas 17 members of the Afghanistan National Security Forces (ANSF) were 
        killed in Taliban and insurgent attacks while supporting the April 5, 
        2014, elections;
Whereas the United States and Afghanistan signed the Enduring Strategic 
        Partnership Agreement to strengthen Afghan sovereignty, stability, and 
        prosperity, while emphasizing a shared goal to defeat al-Qaeda and its 
        terrorist affiliates;
Whereas United States and coalition armed forces have greatly contributed to the 
        stability and security of Afghanistan at a considerable personal 
        sacrifice; and
Whereas the United States has contributed more than $100,000,000 toward the 2014 
        Afghan presidential election: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) commends the Government of Afghanistan for holding a successful 
        first round of the presidential election and expresses strong support 
        for a credible, inclusive, and transparent second round on June 14, 
        2014;
            (2) supports the mandate of Afghan electoral bodies such as the 
        Independent Election Commission (IEC) and the Electoral Complaints 
        Commission (ECC) to administer, adjudicate, and manage polls, as well as 
        oversee logistical and technical preparations in a transparent, fair, 
        and credible manner to prevent fraud and misconduct;
            (3) encourages the Government of Afghanistan to implement measures 
        that will increase voter participation, particularly among the Afghan 
        female population;
            (4) recognizes the determination of the Afghan people to exercise 
        their right to vote and determine their country's destiny;
            (5) urges the Government of Afghanistan to take steps to assure that 
        fraudulent electoral activities do not take place during the runoff;
            (6) urges the IEC to adopt measures to better mitigate fraud, 
        improve electoral transparency of the polling and counting process, and 
        communicate these measures clearly and consistently to the people of 
        Afghanistan;
            (7) urges close and continuing communication between the IEC and the 
        Afghanistan National Security Forces (ANSF) to identify and provide 
        security for vulnerable areas of the country during the election period;
            (8) encourages all elements of Afghan society to refrain from 
        fomenting violence and other disturbances in voting areas;
            (9) urges the ANSF to make every necessary effort to ensure the 
        safety of voters, candidates, poll workers, and election observers;
            (10) expresses its support for the full participation of Afghan 
        civil society in the election process;
            (11) recognizes that a democratically-elected government that 
        reflects the will of the Afghan people and is committed to combating 
        terrorism would promote the long-term stability and security interests 
        of Afghanistan, its neighbors, and its partners in the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization International Security Assistance Force, including 
        the United States; and
            (12) recognizes the sacrifices of United States and coalition armed 
        forces that have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to the 
        security and stability of Afghanistan.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
