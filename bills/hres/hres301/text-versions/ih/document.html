                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for designation of September 2013 as National 
                    Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.

Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers;
Whereas ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer deaths among women in 
        the United States;
Whereas, in 2013, approximately 22,240 new cases of ovarian cancer will be 
        diagnosed and 14,030 women will die of ovarian cancer in the United 
        States;
Whereas these are deaths of our mothers, sisters, daughters, family members, and 
        community leaders;
Whereas the mortality rate for ovarian cancer has not significantly decreased 
        since the ``War on Cancer'' was declared 40 years ago;
Whereas the relative 5-year survival rate is 44 percent, although survival rates 
        vary depending on the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis;
Whereas the lack of a reliable early detection test means that approximately 75 
        percent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected at an advanced stage;
Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and 90 percent of women 
        diagnosed with ovarian cancer do not have a family history that puts 
        them at a higher risk;
Whereas some women, such as those with a family history of breast or ovarian 
        cancer, are at a higher risk for ovarian cancer;
Whereas the Pap test is sensitive and specific to the early detection of 
        cervical cancer, but not ovarian cancer;
Whereas there is currently no reliable early detection test for ovarian cancer;
Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of ovarian cancer often 
        include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling 
        full quickly, urinary symptoms, and several other symptoms that are 
        easily confused with other diseases;
Whereas awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer by women and health care 
        providers can lead to a quicker diagnosis;
Whereas, in June 2007, the first national consensus statement on ovarian cancer 
        symptoms was developed to provide consistency in describing symptoms to 
        make it easier for women to learn and remember the symptoms;
Whereas there are factors that are known to reduce the risk for ovarian cancer 
        and that play an important role in the prevention of the disease, such 
        as prophylactic surgery, the use of oral contraceptives, and 
        breastfeeding;
Whereas each year during the month of September, the Ovarian Cancer National 
        Alliance and its partner members hold a number of events to increase 
        public awareness of ovarian cancer; and
Whereas September 2013 should be designated as ``National Ovarian Cancer 
        Awareness Month'' to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
