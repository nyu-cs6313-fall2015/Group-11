                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Federal 
   laboratories have been and continue to be on the cutting edge of 
scientific and technological advancement and supporting the designation 
              of 2013 as the ``Year of the Federal Lab''.

Whereas a Federal laboratory is defined as any laboratory, federally funded 
        research and development center, or center that is owned, leased, or 
        otherwise used by a Federal agency and funded by the Federal Government;
Whereas the national network of Federal laboratories should be commended for the 
        unique role they have had in countless innovations and advances in the 
        areas of environment, health, national security, and the basic sciences;
Whereas technological progress is responsible for up to half the growth of the 
        United States economy and is the principal driving force behind long-
        term economic growth and increases in our standard of living;
Whereas federally supported research and development has led to new products and 
        processes for the commercial marketplace, including antibiotics, 
        plastics, airplanes, computers, microwaves, and bioengineered drugs;
Whereas Federal laboratories frequently partner with State and local governments 
        and regional organizations to transfer technology to the private sector;
Whereas earning prestigious national and international awards for their research 
        and technology transfer efforts, Federal laboratories lead the way in 
        cutting-edge science and technology;
Whereas the innovations that are produced at the Nation's Federal laboratories 
        fuel economic growth by creating new industries, companies, and jobs;
Whereas since the United States global leadership and national security is 
        dependent on innovation and new industries, the work of the Nation's 
        network of Federal laboratories is essential to the Nation's continued 
        prosperity; and
Whereas 2013 would be an appropriate year to designate as the ``Year of the 
        Federal Lab'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of the ``Year of the Federal 
        Lab'' in celebration of all of the work and accomplishments of 
        the national network of Federal laboratories;
            (2) recognizes that one key to maintaining United States 
        innovation and competitiveness in a global economy is to 
        continue to support federally sponsored research and 
        development;
            (3) acknowledges that the knowledge base, technologies, and 
        techniques generated in the Federal laboratory system serve as 
        a foundation for additional commercially relevant efforts in 
        the private sector;
            (4) commits to find ways to increase Federal investment in 
        the network of Federal laboratories in order to increase 
        support of federally sponsored research and development; and
            (5) encourages the laboratories, the executive branch 
        agencies, and Congress to hold educational and outreach events 
        during the ``Year of the Federal Lab'' to make the public more 
        aware of the work of the Nation's network of Federal 
        laboratories.
