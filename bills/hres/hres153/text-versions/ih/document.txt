                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 violates article I, section 
 7, clause 1 of the United States Constitution because it was a ``Bill 
     for raising Revenue'' that did not originate in the House of 
                            Representatives.

Whereas article I, section 7, clause 1 of the United States Constitution 
        provides that, ``All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the 
        House of Representatives'';
Whereas, on June 28, 2012, a majority of the United States Supreme Court held 
        that the individual mandate provision of the Patient Protection and 
        Affordable Care Act of 2009 ``cannot be upheld as an exercise of 
        Congress's power under the Commerce Clause'' but ``was within Congress's 
        power to tax'';
Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 was originally 
        introduced in the United States Congress by its sponsor as the ``Senate 
        health care bill'' in the form of a Senate Amendment to H.R. 3590, which 
        had passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 416-0 as the 
        ``Service Members Home Ownership Tax Act of 2009'';
Whereas there is ample evidence that the sponsors of the ``Senate health care 
        bill'' not only contemplated the possibility of substantial excess 
        revenues, but explicitly announced on its Senate introduction that, 
        ``This bill will cut the deficit by $130 billion'';
Whereas section 1563 of the Senate amended H.R. 3590 explicitly stated that it 
        was the ``Sense of the Senate [that] this Act will reduce the Federal 
        deficit between 2010 and 2019'', and ``this Act will continue to reduce 
        budget deficits after 2019.''; and
Whereas the ``Senate health care bill'' that the President ultimately signed as 
        H.R. 3590 contains 17 numbered ``Revenue Provisions'', none of which are 
        germane to the subject matter of the original H.R. 3590, and nothing 
        else in the ``Senate health care bill'' was germane to the subject 
        matter of H.R. 3590: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 
        was a ``Bill for raising Revenue'' as those words were intended 
        to be understood in article I, section 7, clause 1 of the 
        United States Constitution; and
            (2) the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009 
        did not originate in the House of Representatives.
                                 <all>
