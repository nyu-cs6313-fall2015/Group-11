                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that adding art 
 and design into Federal programs that target the Science, Technology, 
 Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields encourages innovation and 
                 economic growth in the United States.

Whereas the innovative practices of art and design play an essential role in 
        improving Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) 
        education and advancing STEM research;
Whereas art and design provide real solutions for our everyday lives, 
        distinguish United States products in a global marketplace, and create 
        opportunity for economic growth;
Whereas artists and designers can effectively communicate complex data and 
        scientific information to multiple stakeholders and broad audiences;
Whereas the tools and methods of design offer new models for creative problem-
        solving and interdisciplinary partnerships in a changing world;
Whereas artists and designers are playing an integral role in the development of 
        modern technology;
Whereas artists and designers are playing a key role in manufacturing; and
Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as ``STEM-to-STEAM 
        Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of art and design in the 
        Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) 
        fields;
            (2) supports the designation of ``STEM-to-STEAM Month'';
            (3) encourages the inclusion of art and design in the STEM 
        fields during reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary 
        Education Act;
            (4) encourages the inclusion of art and design in the STEM 
        fields during reauthorization of the Higher Education Act; and
            (5) encourages the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of 
        the Department of Education, the Chairman of the National 
        Endowment for the Arts, and the Director of the National 
        Science Foundation to develop a STEM to STEAM Council 
        representative of artists, designers, education and business 
        leaders, and Federal agencies in order to facilitate a 
        comprehensive approach to incorporate art and design into the 
        Federal STEM programs.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
