                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating Marcel Closset, a French citizen and former member of 
 the French Resistance who was instrumental in saving a United States 
  Army Air Corps pilot during World War II, for receiving the French 
                            Legion of Honor.

Whereas, on September 27, 2014, Marcel Closset, a French citizen and former 
        member of the French Resistance, received the French Legion of Honor in 
        the rank of Knight;
Whereas the French Legion of Honor was created by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 to 
        recognize the accomplishments of military personnel and civilians for 
        their service to France;
Whereas the French Legion of Honor is the highest-ranking order and decoration 
        given in France;
Whereas, on July 17, 2014, the President of France nominated Marcel Closset for 
        the French Legion of Honor to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the 
        liberation of France during World War II;
Whereas Marcel Closset is the current president of L'Amicale des Anciens du 
        maquis de Mazinghien, an association that works to preserve the memory 
        of the members of the French Resistance who fought for the liberation of 
        Mazinghien, France, in 1944; and
Whereas Marcel Closset was one of four people who risked their lives to rescue 
        and hide Eliot Shapleigh, Sr., a United States Army Air Corps pilot from 
        El Paso, Texas, who was forced to parachute from his crippled P-51 
        Mustang into Nazi-occupied France in 1944: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives congratulates Marcel 
Closset for receiving the French Legion of Honor.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
