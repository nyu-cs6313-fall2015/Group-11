                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives in support of the 
                Common Core State Standards Initiative.

Whereas the Common Core State Standards Initiative is a joint effort by the 
        National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council 
        of Chief State School Officers in partnership with Achieve, ACT, and the 
        College Board;
Whereas governors and State commissioners of education from across the country 
        committed to joining a State-led process to develop a common core of 
        State standards in English-language arts and mathematics for grades K-
        12;
Whereas these standards will be research and evidence-based, internationally 
        benchmarked, aligned with college and work expectations, and include 
        rigorous content and skills;
Whereas the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the 
        Council of Chief State School Officers are coordinating the process to 
        develop these standards and have created an expert validation committee 
        to provide an independent review of the common core State standards, as 
        well as the grade-by-grade standards;
Whereas students in the United States compete with peers across the country and 
        around the world; and
Whereas the future economic, diplomatic, and military strength of the United 
        States will be determined by the quality of education available to the 
        Nation's young people: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the 
Council of Chief State School Officers should be commended for their 
efforts to increase the rigor, utility, and comparability of State 
academic standards.
                                 <all>
