                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the goals and ideals of International Water Safety Day.

Whereas International Water Safety Day is celebrated to bring awareness to the 
        ongoing drowning epidemic and educate people in becoming safer in and 
        around the water;
Whereas fatal unintentional drowning is the second leading cause of death for 
        children 1 to 14 years of age;
Whereas fatal unintentional drowning is the sixth leading cause of death for 
        people of all ages;
Whereas an estimated 388,000 people died from drowning, making drowning a major 
        public health problem worldwide and accounting for nearly 10 percent of 
        total global mortality;
Whereas drowning deaths are an epidemic;
Whereas drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury death, 
        accounting for 7 percent of all injury-related deaths;
Whereas water safety education and water safety awareness can help curve the 
        number of drowning fatalities;
Whereas research shows that formal swimming lessons can reduce the risk of 
        drowning by 88 percent among children aged 1 to 4 years old;
Whereas courses such as CPR have shown to improve outcomes for drowning victims 
        since interventions occur more quickly;
Whereas water safety is a life skill that can be taught; and
Whereas water safety education should be included in primary and secondary 
        school education: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of International Water 
        Safety Day;
            (2) acknowledges that water safety education should be 
        included in primary and secondary school education;
            (3) acknowledges the importance of water safety and that 
        every person should engage in water safety education; and
            (4) acknowledges that every person should learn to swim.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
