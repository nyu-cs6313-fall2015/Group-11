                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of the week beginning September 8, 
  2013, as ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week''.

Whereas direct support professionals, direct care workers, personal assistants, 
        personal attendants, in-home support workers, and paraprofessionals 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``direct support professionals'') are 
        the primary providers of publicly funded long-term supports and services 
        for millions of individuals;
Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, trusted relationship 
        with an individual with disabilities;
Whereas a direct support professional assists an individual with disabilities 
        with the most intimate needs on a daily basis;
Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range of support, 
        including--

    (1) preparing meals;

    (2) managing medications;

    (3) bathing;

    (4) dressing;

    (5) helping with mobility;

    (6) providing transportation to school, work, and religious, and 
recreational activities; and

    (7) helping with general daily affairs;

Whereas a direct support professional provides essential support to help keep an 
        individual with disabilities connected to the family and community of 
        the individual;
Whereas direct support professionals enable individuals with disabilities to 
        live meaningful, productive lives;
Whereas a direct support professional is the key to allowing an individual with 
        disabilities to live successfully in the community and avoid more costly 
        institutional care;
Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are female, and many are 
        the sole breadwinners of their families;
Whereas direct support professionals work and pay taxes, but many are 
        impoverished and are eligible for the same Federal and State public 
        assistance programs on which the individuals with disabilities served by 
        the direct support professionals must depend;
Whereas Federal and State policies, as well as the Supreme Court in Olmstead v. 
        L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), assert the right of an individual to live in 
        the home and community of the individual;
Whereas, in 2013, the majority of direct support professionals are employed in 
        home- and community-based settings, and this trend is projected to 
        increase during this decade;
Whereas there is a documented critical and growing shortage of direct support 
        professionals in every community throughout the United States;
Whereas many direct support professionals are forced to leave jobs due to 
        inadequate wages and benefits, creating high turnover and vacancy rates 
        that research demonstrates adversely affects the quality of support 
        provided to individuals with disabilities; and
Whereas the week beginning September 8, 2013, would be an appropriate week to 
        designate as ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Direct Support 
        Professionals Recognition Week'';
            (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct 
        support professionals in enhancing the lives of individuals of 
        all ages with disabilities;
            (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support 
        professionals in supporting the needs that are beyond the 
        capacities of millions of families in the United States;
            (4) commends direct support professionals as integral in 
        supporting the long-term support and services system of the 
        United States; and
            (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public 
        policies of the United States depends on the dedication of 
        direct support professionals.
                                 <all>
