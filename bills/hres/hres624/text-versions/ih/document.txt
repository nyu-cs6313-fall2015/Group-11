                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the 350th anniversary of the founding of New Jersey and 
   honoring the valuable contributions of people of the Garden State.

Whereas in 1664, the parcel of land between the Delaware and Hudson Rivers came 
        under the control of the English, who named the land New Jersey;
Whereas New Jersey played an instrumental role in the colonies' success during 
        the American Revolutionary War, serving as the location of more military 
        engagements than any other colony during the war, including two pivotal 
        colonial victories at Trenton and Princeton in the winter of 1776;
Whereas in 1789, New Jersey became the first State in the United States to 
        ratify the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the United States 
        Constitution;
Whereas men and women of New Jersey, such as Thomas Mundy Peterson, Alice Paul, 
        and Paul Robeson, bravely challenged the Nation to recognize and support 
        equal and just rights of citizenship for all people in the United 
        States;
Whereas New Jersey has been a veritable cauldron of culture, contributing iconic 
        and talented artists in literature, film, theater, dance, music, and 
        visual arts;
Whereas world renowned scientists and scholars, including Thomas Alva Edison and 
        Albert Einstein, conducted their research and launched their discoveries 
        in laboratories and institutions throughout the State, resulting in New 
        Jersey serving as a birthplace for inventions and innovations that 
        fundamentally change the way humans interact with each other and the 
        world around them;
Whereas New Jersey has been a leader in developing and engineering formative 
        infrastructure and transportation accomplishments, from the Morris, and 
        Delaware and Raritan Canals to the iconic Garden State Parkway, as well 
        as the now ubiquitous ``Jersey Barriers'' that provide for the safety of 
        drivers and passengers on roads throughout the country;
Whereas in 1954, the New Jersey State Legislature passed legislation for the 
        State to officially adopt the nickname of the ``Garden State'', a proud 
        acknowledgment of the State's strong agricultural heritage and 
        reflection of the continued abundance of blueberries, cranberries, 
        peaches, and other produce that contribute to New Jersey's robust 
        agricultural industry;
Whereas the people of New Jersey take pride in enjoying and preserving the 
        State's vast natural resources, including the 130 miles of sandy beaches 
        along ``the shore'', as well as the 1,100,000 acres of Pine Barrens that 
        constitute the Nation's first National Reserve; and
Whereas it is fitting and desirable that the people of New Jersey and the United 
        States celebrate the current and historic role of New Jersey in the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes and 
celebrates the 350th anniversary of the founding of New Jersey.
                                 <all>
