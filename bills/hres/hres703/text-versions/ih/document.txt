  Establishing an academic competition in the field of robotics among 
                  students in Congressional districts.

    Resolved,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This resolution may be cited as the ``Robotics Competition 
Resolution of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The House of Representatives finds as follows:
            (1) STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and 
        Mathematics) fields and knowledge have been integral to the 
        development of civilization over the centuries.
            (2) The competitiveness of the United States in the field 
        of robotics in particular is vital to a strong, thriving 
        economy in a world of continuous and rapid technological 
        advancements and needs.
            (3) Robots serve myriad functions that humans cannot, 
        including reducing exposure to toxins and increasing accuracy 
        and speed on assembly lines, thereby reducing risk to members 
        of the military and first responders, among others.
            (4) Robotics technology research and development should be 
        a priority of the United States, especially in encouraging 
        students of all ages to pursue careers in robotics and other 
        STEM fields.
            (5) The robotics industry is positioned to fuel a broad 
        array of next-generation products and applications in fields as 
        diverse as manufacturing, health-care, national defense and 
        security, agriculture, and transportation.
            (6) The global economy demands that the United States 
        continue to lead the world in innovation, creativity, and 
        robotics-related advancements.
            (7) Bringing together Members of Congress and their younger 
        constituents to participate in activities that will result in a 
        deeper appreciation for robotics will foster enthusiasm for 
        education in the sciences.
            (8) The support which students will gain through 
        Congressional recognition of their work on robotics-related 
        projects will encourage them to pursue career paths in 
        robotics, continuing the leadership of the United States in 
        robotics technology development.
            (9) It is appropriate for the House of Representatives to 
        institute a new and worthwhile competition to encourage 
        students to participate in robotics studies and research.
            (10) It would be appropriate to initially challenge 
        students to develop robots that serve certain functions in 
        everyday life.

SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL COMPETITION IN ROBOTICS.

    (a) Establishment of Competition.--There is hereby established an 
academic competition in the field of robotics which shall be held each 
year among students in each Congressional district.
    (b) Regulations.--The competition under this resolution shall be 
carried out in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by 
the Committee on House Administration, except that the regulations 
shall permit the office of a Member to seek guidance from outside 
experts in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics--for the purposes of establishing criteria for the 
selection of competition judges and for the judgment of competition 
submissions.
                                 <all>
