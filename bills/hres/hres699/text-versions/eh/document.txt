H. Res. 699

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                        August 1, 2014.
Whereas the people of Africa share the hopes and aspirations of the people of 
        the United States for peace and prosperity, and are both committed to 
        strengthening economic relations;
Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States to support the 
        reduction of poverty in the continent of Africa;
Whereas greater opportunities for mutually beneficial trade and investments 
        promote economic growth, development, poverty reduction, democracy, the 
        rule of law, and stability;
Whereas the countries in Africa are important economic partners of the United 
        States;
Whereas Africa has today 6 of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world, 
        over 1 billion people, 60 percent of the world's uncultivated 
        agricultural land, and expanding democracies;
Whereas Africa is rich through the youth of its population, enjoying a 
        demographic advantage over all other regions of the world, and is likely 
        to replace the People's Republic of China as the biggest contributor to 
        the global workforce by 2050;
Whereas it is in the economic interest of the United States to engage and 
        compete in emerging African markets, boost United States-Africa trade 
        and investment, support greater capacity building for Africa, and invest 
        in Africa's youth and leadership development;
Whereas in 2000 the Congress passed the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
        (AGOA), with broad bipartisan support and with a view to expanding 
        growth and opportunity in Africa;
Whereas in the original AGOA legislation, Congress encouraged the establishment 
        of more regular high-level dialogues, including regular meetings by the 
        President with his African counterparts;
Whereas exports from sub-Saharan Africa to the United States under AGOA have 
        increased over three-fold from $7.6 billion in 2001 to $24.8 billion in 
        2013;
Whereas United States exports to sub-Saharan Africa have increased from $6.9 
        billion to $23.9 billion and United States investment in sub-Saharan 
        Africa has increased six-fold;
Whereas per capita income in sub-Saharan Africa has more than tripled to $1,624 
        annually since Congress first passed AGOA, yet nearly half the 
        population in sub-Saharan Africa lives in poverty;
Whereas regional integration should be strengthened to boost economic growth in 
        Africa, and elimination of barriers to trade and investment in Africa, 
        such as high tariffs, forced localization requirements, restrictions on 
        investment, and customs barriers, among others, will strengthen and 
        improve regional and global integration;
Whereas it remains the goal of United States policy to support the 
        diversification of sub-Saharan exports in terms of products and 
        countries that utilize AGOA;
Whereas the members of the World Trade Organization adopted several important 
        Decisions and Declarations in Bali, Indonesia, in December 2013, 
        including the Agreement on Trade Facilitation and specific results on 
        agriculture and development, with the protocol of amendment for the 
        Agreement on Trade Facilitation to be adopted on July 31, 2014;
Whereas full implementation by our trading partners of the Agreement on Trade 
        Facilitation will help to address supply-side constraints in Africa, 
        promote regional integration on the continent, and facilitate 
        integration into global supply chains;
Whereas on June 30, 2013, in Cape Town, South Africa, President Barack Obama 
        announced the Power Africa Initiative, to double the number of people 
        with access to power in Sub-Saharan Africa;
Whereas on May 8, 2014, the House of Representatives passed the Electrify Africa 
        Act, to make it a national policy of the United States to support the 
        electrification of sub-Saharan Africa, and to direct United States 
        agencies to devote resources to facilitate and support the 
        implementation of this initiative; and
Whereas the first United States-Africa Leaders' Summit and the 13th African 
        Growth and Opportunity Act Forum will be held in Washington, DC, this 
        summer: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) is studying ways to improve the effectiveness and utilization of 
        the range of United States trade policy tools with respect to Africa, 
        including AGOA, and exploring how Africa can address barriers to become 
        more attractive to trade and investment within Africa as well as 
        globally; and
            (2) looks forward to continuing to work with African leaders to 
        improve our economic and bilateral relationships.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
