                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the significance of Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month 
in May as an important time to celebrate the significant contributions 
   of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to the Nation's history.

Whereas the United States joins together each May to pay tribute to the 
        contributions of generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
        who have enriched our Nation's history;
Whereas the history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United 
        States is inextricably tied to the story of the Nation;
Whereas the Asian American and Pacific Islander community is an inherently 
        diverse population, comprised of over 45 distinct ethnicities and over 
        100 language dialects;
Whereas the United States Census Bureau found that the Asian American population 
        grew faster than any other racial or ethnic group over the last decade, 
        surging nearly 46 percent between 2000 and 2010, a growth rate 4 times 
        faster than the total U.S. population;
Whereas the 2010 decennial census estimated that there are now approximately 
        17,300,000 residents of the United States who identify as Asian and 
        approximately 1,200,000 residents of the United States who identify 
        themselves as Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, making up 
        nearly 6 percent of the total United States population;
Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month 
        because the first Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States on 
        May 7, 1843, and the first transcontinental railroad was completed on 
        May 10, 1869, with substantial contributions from Chinese immigrants;
Whereas the year 2014 marks several important milestones for the Asian American 
        and Pacific Islander community, including the 20th anniversary of the 
        founding of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the 20th 
        anniversary of the creation of the Asian Pacific American Institute for 
        Congressional Studies, and the 15th anniversary of the establishment of 
        the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
        under Executive Order 13125 by President William J. Clinton;
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, officially designates May 
        as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, and requests the President to 
        issue each year a proclamation calling on the people of the United 
        States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
        activities;
Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, such as Daniel K. Inouye, a Medal 
        of Honor and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient who, as President 
        Pro Tempore of the Senate, was the highest-ranking Asian American 
        government official in United States history, Dalip Singh Saund, the 
        first Asian American Congressman, Patsy T. Mink, the first woman of 
        color and Asian American woman to be elected to Congress, Daniel K. 
        Akaka, the first Senator of Native Hawaiian ancestry, Hiram L. Fong, the 
        first Asian American Senator, Norman Y. Mineta, the first Asian American 
        member of a Presidential Cabinet, and others have made significant 
        contributions in both our government and military;
Whereas the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a bicameral caucus of 
        Members of Congress advocating on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders, is composed of 41 Members this year, including 13 Members of 
        Asian or Pacific Islander descent;
Whereas the 113th Congress welcomed a number of historic firsts, including Mazie 
        K. Hirono of Hawaii, the first Asian American woman and first Buddhist 
        to ever serve in the United States Senate, Tammy Duckworth, the first 
        Thai American woman, first wounded female combat Veteran, and first 
        Asian American from Illinois to serve in Congress, Tulsi Gabbard, the 
        first Hindu American and first Pacific Islander woman to serve in 
        Congress, Grace Meng, the first Asian American Member of Congress 
        elected to represent the State of New York, and Mark Takano, the first 
        openly gay person of color to ever serve in Congress;
Whereas in 2014, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are serving in State and 
        Territorial legislatures across the United States in record numbers, 
        including in the States of Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, 
        Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, 
        Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, 
        Utah, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington and in the Territories of 
        American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
        Islands;
Whereas the number of Asian American and Pacific Islander Article III judges 
        more than tripled between 2009 and 2014, reflecting a commitment to 
        diversity in the Federal judiciary that has resulted in the 
        confirmations of high caliber Asian American and Pacific Islander 
        judicial nominees;
Whereas there remains much to be done to ensure that Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders have access to resources, a voice in the United States 
        Government, and continue to advance in the Nation's political landscape; 
        and
Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month provides the people of 
        the United States with an opportunity to recognize the achievements, 
        contributions, history, and address the challenges faced by Asian 
        Americans and Pacific Islanders: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the significance of Asian/Pacific American 
        Heritage Month as an important time to celebrate the 
        significant contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders to the Nation's history; and
            (2) recognizes that Asian American and Pacific Islander 
        communities enhance the rich diversity of the United States and 
        strengthen the Nation.
                                 <all>
