                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Food and 
    Drug Administration should encourage the use of abuse-deterrent 
                         formulations of drugs.

Whereas when abuse-deterrent formulations of a drug have been developed, 
        approved, and recognized as effective by the Food and Drug 
        Administration, the approval and marketing of generic versions that do 
        not have abuse-deterrent features are likely to prevent achievement of 
        the public health purposes of the efforts to develop such abuse-
        deterrent formulations;
Whereas the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Food and Drug 
        Administration have for many years strongly encouraged manufacturers of 
        opioid drug products to develop abuse-deterrent formulations designed to 
        prevent or discourage the abuse or misuse of those products;
Whereas in response, several opioid drug manufacturers have developed abuse-
        deterrent formulations;
Whereas helping to reduce the level of abuse of opioid drug products is 
        dependent on the widespread adoption of new technologies and approaches 
        to the safer formulation of these drugs;
Whereas the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has acknowledged that the Food and 
        Drug Administration has the authority under current law to require 
        generic versions of products that have been formulated or reformulated 
        with abuse-deterrent features to have comparable features; and
Whereas fourteen Members of Congress in a bipartisan coalition have cosponsored 
        the Stop Tampering with Prescription Pills (STOPP) Act, which would 
        similarly promote abuse-deterrent technologies in addictive painkillers: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Food and Drug Administration should exercise its acknowledged 
authority to--
            (1) refuse to approve generic versions of non-abuse-
        deterrent opioid products that have been replaced in the market 
        with abuse-deterrent formulations; and
            (2) require generic versions of abuse-deterrent opioid 
        products to be formulated with comparable abuse-deterrent 
        features.
                                 <all>
