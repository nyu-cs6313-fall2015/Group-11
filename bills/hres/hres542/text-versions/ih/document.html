                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that United States 
  foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority should be suspended until 
 Palestinian Authority Government Resolutions relating to providing a 
monthly salary to anyone imprisoned in Israel's prisons as a result of 
   participation in the struggle against the Israeli occupation are 
                               repealed.

Whereas since fiscal year 2008, the annual regular-year United States bilateral 
        assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has averaged approximately 
        $500 million, including annual averages of approximately $200 million in 
        direct budgetary assistance and $100 million in non-lethal security 
        assistance for the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank;
Whereas the Government Accountability Office has found some glaring 
        insufficiencies in the vetting process of the foreign aid grants to the 
        Palestinian Authority and as such it is very easy for United States 
        foreign aid dollars to be used to provide a monthly stipend for accused 
        terrorists;
Whereas Palestinian Authority Government Resolutions 21 and 23 (2010) codified 
        into law a longstanding Palestinian Authority practice of providing a 
        monthly salary to ``anyone imprisoned in the occupation's [Israel's] 
        prisons as a result of his participation in the struggle against the 
        occupation.''; and
Whereas, according to the Palestinian Authority's definition, more than 4,500 
        Palestinian prisoners as of December 2012 are serving time for terror-
        related offenses and are recipients of salaries allocated from the 
        Palestinian Authority's general salary budget that range from 2,400 to 
        12,000 shekels ($680 to $3,400) a month: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
United States foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority should be 
suspended until Palestinian Authority Government Resolutions 21 and 23 
(2010) are repealed.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
