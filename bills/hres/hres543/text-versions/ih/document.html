Whereas Macedonia is an active participant as the first state partner of the 
        Vermont National Guard for the past 20 years, and since 1995, more than 
        3,000 Macedonians and Vermonters have shared their expertise in more 
        than 800 events as the partnership has developed, including a joint 
        military embedment in Afghanistan in 2011;
Whereas during the 1999 Kosovo crisis, Macedonia received and accommodated 
        400,000 Kosovar refugees, and served as a staging area and main corridor 
        for logistical support to the NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR) as well as 
        leading the KFOR Coordination Centre for logistical support in Skopje 
        since 2006;
Whereas under its NATO Membership Action Plan, Macedonia, in its 14th cycle of 
        MAP, has made strong strides on major reforms and reconstruction of its 
        armed forces towards the goal of building and sustaining a modern, 
        professional defense force of about 12,000 troops that is fully 
        interoperable with NATO;
Whereas Macedonia was one of the first countries to offer support to the United 
        States after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which has had a

        as stated by the late Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski;
Whereas in Afghanistan, Macedonia, who patrols International Security Assistance 
        Force (ISAF) headquarters in Kabul, and is the fifth largest ISAF troop

        United States troops, increasing troop levels in 2010;

        Herzegovina and has contributed troops in Lebanon;

        Declaration in Bucharest made clear that the Republic of Macedonia has 
        met NATO's democratic, economic, and defense standards through its 
        rigorous participation in the Membership Action Plan.'';
Whereas the 2008 Declaration outlined the importance of close partnership 
        between the two countries based upon common goals, interests, and 
        values, in order to enhance their strategic relationship through 
        intensified consultation and cooperation in the areas of security,

        to provide additional assistance to Macedonia to help build prosperity 
        and strengthen security;
Whereas the United States and Macedonia noted that a democratic, secure, and 
        prosperous Macedonia, with friendly and constructive relations with its 
        neighbors is vital to peace and stability in Southeast Europe;
Whereas the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2011 in its final 
        judgment, without possibility for appeal, and binding on the parties, 
        found that Greece, by objecting to the admission of Macedonia to NATO 
        during the 2008 Bucharest Summit, has breached its obligation under 
        article 11 of the United Nations Interim Accord of September 13, 1995;
Whereas current United States President Barack Obama on April 4, 2009, at the 
        Strasbourg-Kehl NATO Summit stated ``I look forward to the day when we 
        can welcome Macedonia to the Alliance.'';

        aspirant partners Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 
        Georgia;
Whereas Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at the 2012 Chicago Summit 
        stated ``I believe this summit should be the last summit that is not an 
        enlargement summit'';
Whereas Macedonia is strategically located in Southeast Europe displaying a 
        unique gateway for rapid NATO troop deployments to the Middle East and 
        North Africa in order to maintain regional stability;
Whereas Macedonia has been recognized by the World Bank and the European Union 
        as an economic reformer, and according to the Heritage Foundation/Wall 
        Street Journal 2014 Index of Economic Freedom, Macedonia's economic 
        freedom score is 68.6, making its economy the 43rd freest in the 2014 
        Index and is ranked 20th out of 43 countries in the Europe region, and 
        its overall score is above the world and regional averages;
Whereas Macedonia's NATO membership would benefit Greek businesses, which are 
        one of the most significant foreign direct investors in Macedonia; and

        made by 2008 Bucharest Summit, 2010 Lisbon Summit, and 2012 Chicago 
        Summit, is active in NATO missions, and obtained the support of the ICJ, 
        the UK Summit in September 2014 provides a moment of opportunity for the 
        Alliance to complete Macedonia's transition into NATO: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--

            (3) recognizes the significant benefits of closer economic 
        and political ties between NATO members and Macedonia in its

        principle of mutual defense of all NATO members, including 
        Greece;
            (4) recognizes the importance of the NATO membership for 
        Macedonia for its economic growth, strengthening of the

            (5) greatly appreciates the efforts of Macedonia in its

            (7) acknowledges and supports the progress made by 
        Macedonia's efforts in the NATO membership process;
            (8) calls on the Administration and United States 
        Department of State to work with Greece and NATO allies to 
        ensure that bilateral disputes do not impede Macedonia's NATO 
        accession for the sake of regional stability in light of the 
        current situation with Ukraine; and
            (9) urges NATO members to formally extend an invitation to
