        leaders;
Whereas financial education is the first line of defense against financial fraud 
        and securing a prosperous future;

        confident'' about having enough money for a comfortable retirement, up 
        by 5 percent points from the previous year, but a sharp decline in

Whereas according to the 2013 Consumer Financial Literacy Survey Final Report of 
        the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, 26 percent, or more than

        United States adults say they are saving less in 2013 than the year 
        before;

        confident in making financial decisions;
Whereas expanding access to the mainstream financial system will provide 
        individuals with less expensive and more secure options for managing 
        finances and building wealth;

        individuals are prepared to manage money, credit, and debt, and to 
        become responsible workers, heads of households, investors,

Whereas increased financial literacy empowers individuals to make wise financial

        schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and the people of 
        the United States to support the goals and ideals of 
        ``Financial Literacy Month'' with appropriate programs and 
        activities.
