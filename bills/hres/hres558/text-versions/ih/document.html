                               RESOLUTION


 
Prohibiting the use of the Members' Representational Allowance for the 
      payment of the costs of first-class airline accommodations.

    Resolved,

SECTION 1. PROHIBITING USE OF MEMBERS' REPRESENTATIONAL ALLOWANCE FOR 
              FIRST-CLASS AIRLINE ACCOMMODATIONS.

    (a) Revision of Regulations Governing the Use of the MRA.--The 
Committee on House Administration shall promulgate revisions to the 
regulations governing the use of the Members' Representational 
Allowance to ensure that the Allowance is not used for the payment of 
the costs of first-class airline accommodations for domestic travel 
except as provided under subsection (b).
    (b) Exceptions.--Under the revisions promulgated by the Committee 
on House Administration under subsection (a), a Members' 
Representational Allowance may be used for the payment of the costs of 
first-class airline accommodations for domestic travel if the Member 
whose Allowance will be used for such payment certifies in writing to 
the Committee that any of the following applies:
            (1) The use of first-class accommodations is necessary to 
        accommodate a medical disability or other special need, as 
        demonstrated by such documentation as the Committee may 
        require.
            (2) No accommodations other than first-class accommodations 
        are reasonably available given the timing of the travel, but 
        only if the travel is urgent and the purpose of the travel may 
        not be carried out on alternative dates.
            (3) The use of first-class accommodations is necessary 
        because of exceptional security circumstances or other 
        exceptional circumstances.
            (4) The use of first-class accommodations will result in an 
        overall cost savings by avoiding additional subsistence costs, 
        overtime, or lost productive time while awaiting coach-class 
        accommodations.
            (5) The length of the flight is 5 hours or greater.
    (c) Domestic Travel Defined.--For purposes of this resolution, 
``domestic travel'' means travel within the continental United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
