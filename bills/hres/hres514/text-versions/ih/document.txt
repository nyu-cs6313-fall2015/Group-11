                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring Thomas Jennings of New York City as the first African-American 
              to be granted a patent by the United States.

Whereas Thomas Jennings was born a free African-American in New York City in 
        1791 and became a successful tailor with a shop on Church Street in New 
        York City;
Whereas Thomas Jennings invented a cleaning process called ``dry scouring'', 
        which was the precursor to dry cleaning;
Whereas, on March 3, 1821, Thomas Jennings became the first African-American to 
        be granted a patent by the United States for his cleaning process;
Whereas, before the Civil War, patent laws made it significantly hard, if not 
        impossible, for slaves to hold a patent, but Thomas Jennings was able to 
        obtain a patent because of his free status; and
Whereas Thomas Jennings utilized the earnings from his invention and business to 
        help advance civil rights for African-Americans and to advocate for the 
        abolition of slavery: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors Thomas Jennings as the first African-American to 
        be granted a patent by the United States Patent and Trademark 
        Office;
            (2) commends Thomas Jennings for his economic contributions 
        to the United States through use of the patent system; and
            (3) acknowledges that Thomas Jennings' inventive 
        contributions encourage Americans to continue a legacy of 
        innovation in the fields of science, technoloy, engineering, 
        and math.
