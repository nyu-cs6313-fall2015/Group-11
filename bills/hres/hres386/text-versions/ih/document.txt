                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the religious and historical significance of the festival 
                               of Diwali.

Whereas for millions of Indian Americans, Diwali (or Deepavali) is a time for 
        thanksgiving and prayer for health, knowledge and peace;
Whereas this year, 2013, many Members of Congress will celebrate Diwali in the 
        United States Capitol for the first time;
Whereas Diwali, a festival of great significance to Indian Americans, is 
        celebrated annually by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and others throughout the 
        United States;
Whereas Diwali is a festival of lights, during which celebrants light small oil 
        lamps, place them around the home, and pray for health, knowledge and 
        peace;
Whereas celebrants of Diwali believe that the rows of lamps symbolize the light 
        within the individual that rids the soul of the darkness of ignorance;
Whereas Diwali falls on the last day of the last month in the lunar calendar and 
        is celebrated as a day of thanksgiving and the beginning of the New Year 
        for many Hindus;
Whereas for Hindus, Diwali is a celebration of the return of God following the 
        vanquishing of demonic forces;
Whereas for Sikhs, Diwali is feted as the day on which the sixth founding Sikh 
        guru, Guru Hargobind, was released from captivity by the Mughal Emperor 
        Jehangir;
Whereas for Jains, Diwali marks the anniversary of the attainment of Nirvana by 
        Lord Mahavira, the last of the Tirthankaras (founders of the Jain 
        philosophy); and
Whereas Diwali is a celebration of great importance in Indian American 
        communities throughout the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the historical and religious significance of 
        Diwali;
            (2) in observance of Diwali, the festival of lights, 
        expresses its deepest respect for Indian Americans and the 
        Indian Diaspora throughout the world on this significant 
        occasion;
            (3) recognizes and appreciates the religious diversity in 
        both India and the United States and throughout the world; and
            (4) acknowledges and supports the relationship of 
        collaboration and respect between the United States and India.
