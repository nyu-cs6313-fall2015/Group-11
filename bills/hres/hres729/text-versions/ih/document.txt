                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for the designation of September 19, 2014 as 
  National Service Coordinator Day to recognize the value of service 
coordinators in subsidized and other affordable housing communities for 
    their work to promote and support economic self-sufficiency and 
independence for low-income families, older Americans, and persons with 
                             disabilities.

Whereas the work of service coordinators in the United States aids more than 
        1,000,000 low-income Americans residing in publicly subsidized and other 
        affordable housing communities;
Whereas recent evidence shows that the provision of resident services through 
        service coordinators results in dramatic benefits for both residents and 
        developers of affordable housing;
Whereas low-income families who are assisted by service coordinators have 
        housing stability, experience growth in household income, have improved 
        job skills and better parenting skills, have access to convenient after-
        school programs for their children, and move faster towards economic 
        self-sufficiency;
Whereas older Americans who are assisted by service coordinators experience 
        benefits in their health outcomes and have the ability to age in-place 
        as they become more frail, thereby delaying or preventing the transfer 
        to a more expensive nursing home setting;
Whereas persons with disabilities residing in housing communities having a 
        service coordinator are aided in maximizing their independence to the 
        greatest extent possible;
Whereas affordable housing developers are benefitted by having a service 
        coordinator on staff as coordinators can intervene rapidly to address 
        resident crises and issues that otherwise might lead to evictions, can 
        reduce damages to the property, and can provide a sense of community and 
        safe and stable housing;
Whereas the profession of service coordination is dedicated to empowering 
        residents to maximize their independence and self-sufficiency, holds 
        residents' rights to self-determination in the highest regard, and 
        instills trust through maintaining high standards of confidentiality;
Whereas residents in subsidized and affordable housing communities having a 
        service coordinator report higher satisfaction with their living 
        environments and a heightened desire to be productive members of their 
        communities;
Whereas service coordinators in subsidized and other affordable housing 
        communities are collectively supported and promoted through the efforts 
        of the American Association of Service Coordinators that was 
        incorporated in the State of Ohio on September 19, 1999; and
Whereas September 19, 2014 is the 15th anniversary of such incorporation and 
        would be an appropriate day to designate as National Service Coordinator 
        Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of National Service 
        Coordinator Day;
            (2) recognizes the value of service coordinators in 
        assisting low-income Americans to maintain and maximize their 
        independence and strive toward economic self-sufficiency; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to learn 
        about service coordination and the role service coordinators 
        play in aiding in the stabilization of housing, maximizing 
        independence, and achieving self-sufficiency for America's 
        vulnerable populations.
