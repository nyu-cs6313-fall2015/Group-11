  Honoring the service and sacrifice of members of the United States

Whereas, on April 9, 2003, with the removal of a statue of Saddam Hussein in 
        Firdos Square in Baghdad by members of the United States Armed Forces

        effectively neutralized the Iraqi Army just three weeks after ground 
        operations began;

        United States Air Force airstrike near Baquba killed Abu Musab al-

Whereas, on January 10, 2007, with the number of members of the United States 
        Armed Forces in Iraq totaling approximately 140,000, a surge of 21,000 
        American troops was announced under the banner of ``A New Way Forward'';
Whereas, on June 1, 2007, in what was called ``The Awakening'', Sunni tribe

        and coalition forces, Iraqi parliamentary elections are held under the 
        control of Iraqi security forces, with voter turnout registering above 
        60 percent;
Whereas in September 2010, the remaining combat forces of the United States 
        Armed Forces departed from Iraq, prompting the redesignation of the 
        contingency operation from Operation Iraqi Freedom to Operation New 
        Dawn;
Whereas, on December 18, 2011, all remaining members of the United States Armed 
        Forces departed from Iraq;
Whereas between March 2003 and December 2011, more than 1.5 million members of 
        the United States Armed Forces served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and 
        Operation New Dawn;
Whereas 4,486 members of the United States Armed Forces made the ultimate 
        sacrifice while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New 
        Dawn and more than 32,000 members of the United States Armed Forces were 
        wounded during almost nine years of military operations in Iraq;
Whereas four Medals of Honor, the highest United States award for military 
        valor, were awarded for service in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation

Whereas at least 327 Silver Stars, 21 Navy Crosses, and 15 Distinguished Service 
        Crosses were awarded to members of the United States Armed Forces for 
        gallantry in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn; and
Whereas March 19, 2013, is the 10th anniversary of the start of United States 
        military operations in Iraq as Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New

        Forces in operations against a dangerous and determined enemy;
            (3) recognizes the tremendous personal sacrifice of the

        and the contributions of military families on the homefront;
            (4) pays tribute to the 4,486 members of the United States 
        Armed Forces who lost their lives in Operation Iraqi Freedom
