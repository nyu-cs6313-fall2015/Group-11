                               RESOLUTION


 
                 Celebrating the West Linn Centennial.

Whereas in 1845, at Robert Moore's request, the Provisional Legislature of 
        Oregon named the town on the site ``Linn City'', in honor of former 
        Senator Lewis Linn who had advocated for passage of the Donation Land 
        Claim Act that Moore used to establish the town;
Whereas West Linn became home to burgeoning industry including flour mills, 
        lumber mills, and shipping;
Whereas on August 15, 1913, after nearly 75 years as a United States settlement 
        and thousands of years as a sacred home to indigenous peoples, West Linn 
        was incorporated as a city in the State of Oregon;
Whereas West Linn played an important role in the development of Oregon and the 
        industrialization of the West;
Whereas Robert Moore came from Illinois to Oregon in the early 1840s and 
        purchased a 1,000 acre plot of land along the west bank of the 
        Willamette River, an area that would eventually become West Linn, from 
        Chief Wanaxha of the Wallamut Indians;
Whereas in 1913, the West Side Improvement Club voted 50-7 to incorporate the 
        districts of West Oregon City, Bolton, Sunset, and Willamette Heights as 
        the modern city of West Linn, in order to obtain needed utilities and 
        improvements;
Whereas West Linn has adopted the motto, ``City of Hills, Trees, and Rivers'', 
        which recognizes the natural beauty of its landscape; and
Whereas in order to commemorate its centennial and to properly celebrate the 
        history of its people, the West Linn Centennial Planning Committee was 
        established in 2010 to organize, oversee, and execute the celebration to 
        mark the one hundred year anniversary of West Linn: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives honors and commends the 
City of West Linn, Oregon, and its people on West Linn's centennial.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
