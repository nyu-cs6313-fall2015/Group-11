		<whereas><text>Whereas additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a process by which digital 3D design
			 data is used to build up a component in layers by depositing material;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 3D printing creates an object layer by layer, greatly reducing waste and increasing
			 efficiency compared to traditional manufacturing techniques;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 3D printing has grown exponentially over the last several years;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States is a world leader in advanced manufacturing, and has a history of design
			 innovation;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas public-private partnerships that promote advanced manufacturing, such as the Digital
			 Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute and other Manufacturing
			 Innovation Institutes, will develop enhanced digital capabilities to
			 design and test new products and reduce costs in manufacturing processes
			 across a variety of industries;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 3D printing has widespread applications in home construction, home goods production,
			 biotechnology, the automotive sector, aerospace, medicine, consumer
			 electronics, and defense;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 3D printing has the potential to reshape manufacturing in the United States, by decreasing
			 the cost of producing goods for small businesses and local manufacturers;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas innovation will be increased, as 3D printing reduces the time required for product
			 development and market launch; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas December 3, 2014, would be an appropriate date to designate as the <quote>National Day of 3D Printing</quote>: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
