 Recognizing the 20th anniversary of AmeriCorps on September 12, 2014.

Whereas every day in communities across America, AmeriCorps members are making a 
        powerful impact on the most critical issues facing our Nation;
Whereas, on September 12, 2014, the Nation will mark the 20th anniversary of 
        AmeriCorps with a simultaneous, nationwide swearing-in of a new class of 
        AmeriCorps members and recognition events saluting AmeriCorps members 
        and alumni for their dedication and impact;
Whereas AmeriCorps has proven to be a highly effective way to engage Americans 
        in solving problems, strengthening communities, bolstering the volunteer 
        sector, renewing the ethic of service, and expanding economic and 
        educational opportunity for those who serve;
Whereas since 1994, more than 900,000 Americans of all ages and backgrounds have 
        joined AmeriCorps, serving more than 1 billion hours and improving the 
        lives of countless Americans;
Whereas AmeriCorps members address the most pressing challenges facing our 
        Nation: educating students for jobs of the 21st century, expanding 
        economic opportunity, addressing the needs of military families and a 
        new generation of veterans returning from war, helping communities 
        rebuild after natural disasters, promoting health and well-being, and 
        preserving the Nation's parks and public lands;
Whereas national service expands economic opportunity by creating more 
        sustainable, resilient communities and providing experience, career 
        skills, and more than $2.7 billion in college scholarships for those who 
        serve;
Whereas AmeriCorps members last year mobilized more than 4,000,000 community 
        volunteers, helping the organizations they serve significantly increase 
        their reach and impact;
Whereas AmeriCorps members serve in more than 25,000 locations nationwide, 
        bolstering the civic, neighborhood, and faith-based organizations that 
        are so vital to our Nation's well-being;
Whereas AmeriCorps is a model public-private partnership that generates hundreds 
        of millions of dollars of nongovernmental resources each year to 
        strengthen community impact and increase return on taxpayer dollars;
Whereas AmeriCorps, working hand-in-hand with its network of Governor-appointed 
        State Service commissions, has developed an efficient and effective 
        structure for engaging Americans in results-driven service that is 
        poised for further growth and success in the future;
Whereas in response to the strong demand from nonprofit organizations and from 
        individuals who want to serve, AmeriCorps has developed innovative and 
        cost-effective partnerships with other Federal agencies and the private 
        sector that meet critical national needs and expand opportunities for 
        Americans to serve their country; and
Whereas AmeriCorps members demonstrate commitment, dedication, and patriotism by 
        making an intensive commitment to service, and after their terms of 
        service remain engaged in our communities as volunteers, public 
        servants, and civic leaders in disproportionately high levels: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) acknowledges the significant impact and value of 
        AmeriCorps members, alumni, and community partners over the 
        past 20 years;
            (2) promotes a national effort to salute AmeriCorps members 
        and alumni for 20 years of service to America; and
            (3) encourages citizens of all ages to find ways to give 
        back to their communities and country through AmeriCorps and 
        other programs.
                                 <all>
