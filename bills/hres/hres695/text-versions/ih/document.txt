    Resolved,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This resolution may be cited as the ``Restore Democracy 
Resolution''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

    It is the purpose of this resolution to express the sense of the 
House of Representatives that Congress should--
            (1) clarify its power to set limits on the amount of money 
        that can be spent on a campaign for election for Federal 
        office;
            (2) make clear that corporations are not people for 
        purposes of the First Amendment right to make campaign 
        contributions;
            (3) confirm that money is not free speech;
            (4) limit the campaign advertising season to 60 days before 
        an election;
            (5) prohibit candidates from soliciting or collecting 
        campaign contributions during legislative sessions;
            (6) protect the constitutional right to vote by expanding 
        online voter registration systems;
            (7) emphasize the need for compact, contiguous 
        Congressional districts that are not gerrymandered to favor an 
        incumbent or political party; and
            (8) restore regular order in the legislative process by 
        requiring bills to go through committee consideration and come 
        to the floor under an open rule.

          TITLE I--REDUCING THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS

SEC. 101. REDUCING THE INFLUENCE OF MONEY IN POLITICS.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
            (1) the case of Citizens United v. Federal Election 
        Commission (558 U.S. 310) opened the door to the corrupting 
        influence of money in politics;
            (2) in order to restore the American people's faith in the 
        integrity of their elected government, Congress should have the 
        power to regulate the raising and spending of money and in-kind 
        equivalents with respect to Federal elections, including 
        through regulating--
                    (A) the amount of contributions to candidates for 
                nomination or election to Federal office,
                    (B) the amount of expenditures that may be made by, 
                in support of, or in opposition to such candidates, and
                    (C) the content and integrity of such expenditures; 
                and
            (3) all political contributions should be publicly 
        disclosed, including those made to or by independent groups, so 
        that voters have complete information about who is paying for 
        political advertisements.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that, in order to 
eliminate the undue influence of money in politics--
            (1) Congress should create a public finance system for 
        Congressional elections, which will ensure that Congress is 
        responsible to voters instead of well-financed special 
        interests; and
            (2) Members of Congress should devote their full time to 
        regular order and governing instead of campaign fundraising.

        should not be allowed to expend campaign funds on advertising 
        more than 60 days before a primary or general election;
            (3) candidates for Congressional office, both incumbents 
        and challengers, should not be allowed to solicit or collect 
        campaign contributions during the hours in which Congress is in 
        session; and
            (4) States should create a single Congressional primary 
        date to increase voter education and participation.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
            (1) Congress has the power to prohibit voter suppression 
        activities; and
            (2) in order to increase voter access and participation, 
        Congress should require every State to create and maintain an 
        online voter registration system.

SEC. 501. ELIMINATING PARTISAN REDISTRICTING AND GERRYMANDERING.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
            (1) Congress should establish a Federal reapportionment

        geographic boundaries and county lines;
            (2) Congressional districts should not favor or disfavor an 
        incumbent or political party;
            (3) Congressional districts should adhere to the existing 
        standards of equal population; and
            (4) the highest court of each State should have the power

        above criteria.

    It is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
            (1) it should not be in order to consider a bill or 
        resolution in the House unless each committee to which the bill 
        or resolution is referred--
                    (A) had a hearing on the bill or resolution at 
                which amendments were permitted to be offered and 
                debated and a vote was taken on each amendment offered 
                and on final passage, and
