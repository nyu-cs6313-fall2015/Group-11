        justice;
Whereas social workers know that poverty and trauma can create lifelong social 
        and economic disadvantages;
Whereas social workers know that discrimination of any kind limits human 
        potential and must be eliminated;
Whereas social workers stand up for individuals and support diverse families in 
        every community;

        their environments, improve their relationships with others, and solve 
        personal and family problems;
Whereas all children have the right to safe environments and quality education;
Whereas dignity and care giving for older adults help define a Nation's 
        character;
Whereas veterans and their families need community support to ensure successful 
        transitions after service;
Whereas access to mental health treatment and health care services saves 
        millions of lives;
Whereas social workers are change agents who put the ideals of citizenship into 
        action every day;
Whereas social workers believe in shared prosperity and opportunity for 
        everyone;
Whereas social work research and advocacy turn community needs into national 
        priorities;
Whereas social workers celebrate the courage, hope, and strength of the human 
        spirit throughout their careers; and
