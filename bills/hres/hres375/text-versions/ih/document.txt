                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Congress 
should refrain from conditioning the resolution of fiscal and budgetary 
 disputes on the taking of action relating to non-germane legislative 
                                matters.

Whereas the American Government was formed to establish a more perfect union, 
        establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common 
        defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of 
        liberty;
Whereas Americans have a right to expect their Federal Government will be there 
        for them when needed;
Whereas the cost of a shutdown of Government operations has major, adverse, and 
        lasting consequences on the economy, on people, and on workers;
Whereas the legislative and executive branches are expected to resolve 
        differences over budgetary and fiscal priorities in a responsible way; 
        and
Whereas conditioning the resolution of budgetary and fiscal disputes on the 
        taking of action relating to non-germane legislative matters, including 
        the repeal or modification of a duly enacted law, negatively impacts the 
        ability to reach agreement and hurts the American economy and the 
        persons who provide and depend upon the services of the Federal 
        Government: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Congress should refrain from conditioning the resolution of fiscal and 
budgetary disputes on the taking of action relating to non-germane 
legislative matters, including the repeal or modification of a duly 
enacted law.
                                 <all>
