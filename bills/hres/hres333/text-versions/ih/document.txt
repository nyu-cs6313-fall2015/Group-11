                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the firm conviction of the House of Representatives that any 
 continuing resolution or debt ceiling increase it may approve for the 
duration of the 113th Congress shall affirmatively include a provision 
   specifically prohibiting the expenditure of any Federal funds in 
 support of or in implementation or effectuation or enforcement of any 
         provision of the Affordable Care Act (``ObamaCare'').

Whereas every Representative solemnly swore to support and defend the 
        Constitution of the United States against all domestic enemies, and bear 
        true faith and allegiance to the same, and freely took said obligation 
        before God;
Whereas a majority of Representatives believes the Affordable Care Act 
        (``ObamaCare'') violates the Constitution in sundry ways, and its 
        implementation and enforcement would deprive American citizens of 
        cherished fundamental constitutional rights;
Whereas in addition to its organic constitutional infirmities, at least one 
        Administrative Rule promulgated pursuant to ObamaCare has further harmed 
        the constitutional rights of citizens by attacking religious liberties 
        guaranteed by the First Amendment to our constitution for over two 
        centuries, said liberties being once held sacrosanct by this body;
Whereas the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget Resolution already passed by this House of 
        Representatives wisely and appropriately presumed the defunding of 
        ObamaCare subsequent to and pursuant to a more sober consideration of 
        its rash and sweeping provisions, free from the hysteria and parochial 
        politics of the moment of its passing, which sober consideration 
        revealed ObamaCare's many and now manifest kinks, flaws, deficiencies, 
        and inadequacies, both constitutional and logistical;
Whereas a bipartisan majority of Representatives voted to repeal ObamaCare on 
        May 16, 2013;
Whereas a majority of Representatives supports the provision of the House 
        Republicans' 2010 ``Pledge to America'' that promises, in no uncertain 
        terms, ``We will repeal President Obama's government takeover of health 
        care'';
Whereas a majority of Representatives remains committed to the ``Repealing 
        Obamacare'' Plank of the 2012 Republican Party Platform, which states, 
        in pertinent part: ``We agree with the four dissenting justices of the 
        Supreme Court: `In our view the entire Act before us is invalid in its 
        entirety.' . . . Obamacare has been struck down in the court of public 
        opinion and is falling by the weight of its own confusing, unworkable, 
        budget-busting, and conflicting provisions. . . . If fully implemented, 
        it could not function; . . . Congressional Republicans are committed to 
        its repeal'';
Whereas a majority of Representatives shares the Speaker's view that ObamaCare 
        is a ``monstrosity'' that will ``ruin the best health care system in the 
        world and bankrupt this country'', that it is ``driving up the cost of 
        health insurance, denying people access to quality care, and killing 
        jobs in America'', and asks, as the Speaker has asked, ``How can you 
        provide subsidies through these health exchanges without verifying 
        people's income? I mean our job is to protect the American people, is to 
        spend their taxpayer money wisely. I think it's wide open for abuse'';
Whereas a majority of Representatives supports the pledge twice expressed by the 
        Speaker in July 2013 regarding the funding of ObamaCare: ``We're going 
        to do everything we can to make sure it never happens, and further'', 
        ``[We will] do everything we can to make sure this doesn't really go 
        into effect. We will continue to do everything we can to defund it . . . 
        and to make sure that the American people aren't put through this 
        horrific experience'';
Whereas notwithstanding the oft-repeated ``guarantee'' previously expressed by 
        President Obama that citizens will definitely be able to keep their 
        present doctors after the implementation of ObamaCare, the Department of 
        Health and Human Services (HHS) has recently announced ``you MAY be able 
        to keep your current doctor'' (emphasis supplied), thereby conceding 
        that the President's promise to the citizenry has not been kept, and 
        that the legislation contains no such guarantee;
Whereas the Presidential Administration's recent decision to delay ObamaCare's 
        employer mandate and eligibility verification for individual exchanges 
        constitutes a tacit admission that ObamaCare is, in the words of the 
        Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, at best, a ``train wreck'' 
        not yet ready for prime time, and more likely, an imminent disaster;
Whereas the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reports (1) the Federal Government 
        will spend $48 billion in 2014--and nearly $1.8 trillion through 2023--
        on ObamaCare's new entitlement programs, (2) the Presidential 
        Administration has requested more than $400 million in funding and 
        nearly 2,000 bureaucrats for the IRS to implement the individual mandate 
        and 46 other statutory provisions in the law, (3) executive branch 
        agencies' bureaucrats have already written more than 20,000 pages of 
        ObamaCare-related rules and notices published in the Federal Register, 
        and (4) CBO estimates ObamaCare will raise individual health insurance 
        premiums by $2,100 per year;
Whereas the current ObamaCare statute is no longer the legitimate product of the 
        legislative voice of the American people, having been rewritten by the 
        two branches of government least accountable to those people, inasmuch 
        as the President has used and continues to use myriad waivers and delays 
        to alter various sections of the legislation to suit his own policy and 
        political objectives, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court having 
        flagrantly disregarded the position of the people that ObamaCare is not 
        a product of the taxing power;
Whereas the House of the people should not force the American citizenry to fund 
        ObamaCare if the Presidential Administration will not enforce the law as 
        written;
Whereas inasmuch as the House of Representatives cannot control the actions of 
        the United States Senate or the President, and has no power to prevent 
        the Senate or the President from shutting down the government if either 
        chooses to do so by refusing to approve or sign a Continuing Resolution, 
        passed by the House of Representatives, that will fund the government's 
        operations and satisfy its obligations to it citizenry and others;
Whereas the Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate has had sixty (60) or 
        more Members for only four months of the last 34 years, and 
        Congressional Democrats exploited that anomalous window in the 111th 
        Congress to pass ObamaCare;
Whereas the Republican Conference of the United States Senate has not had sixty 
        (60) or more Members since the 61st Congress adjourned sine die in the 
        year of our Lord 1911 and therefore the ``outright repeal'' of ObamaCare 
        must be presumed to be nigh unto an electoral impossibility, 
        irrespective of how favorable the next election is to Republican Senate 
        candidates;
Whereas the only means by which ObamaCare can be halted is for the Congress to 
        exercise its ``power of the purse'' to defund it, and thereby effect 
        constructive repeal; and
Whereas defunding ObamaCare will become more complicated and difficult to 
        achieve after October 1, 2013 (the date enrollment for the Medicaid 
        expansion and exchange subsidies begins) and especially after January 1, 
        2014 (the date those new entitlement programs are scheduled to take 
        effect, and Americans will be forced either to buy a product or pay tax 
        penalties administered by the IRS): Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That for the balance of the 113th Congress, the House of 
Representatives shall pass no bill or resolution that continues 
appropriations in the event of a lapse in appropriations or increases 
the borrowing authority relating to the public debt limit (or suspends 
or terminates the debt ceiling) unless said resolution contains a 
provision affirmatively and specifically prohibiting the expenditure of 
any Federal funds (whether such expenditure be discretionary or 
mandatory) to implement or enforce any provision of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) or title I or 
subtitle B of title II of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation 
Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152).
