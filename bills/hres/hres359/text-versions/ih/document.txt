                           September 25, 2013

Mr. Schneider (for himself, Mr. Carney, Mr. Mulvaney, and Mr. Scalise)

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that tax reform 
    should jointly address corporate and pass-through entities in a 
fiscally responsible manner, and that reform should reduce the current 
tax rate differences between corporate and pass-through entities while 
       maintaining adequate forms of organization for businesses.

Whereas pass-through entities such as S corporations, partnerships, limited 
        liability companies, and sole proprietorships account for more than 90 
        percent of all business entities;
Whereas the Internal Revenue Service reports 4.5 million S corporations, 3.5 
        million partnerships and limited liability companies, 23 million sole 
        proprietorships, and less than 2 million C corporations;
Whereas pass-through entities employ 54 percent of the private sector workforce;
Whereas pass-through entities are taxed at individual income tax rates; and
Whereas the top pass-through tax rate is now 39.6 percent for taxable income 
        above $400,000 and the top corporate income tax rate is 35 percent: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
tax reform should jointly address corporate and pass-through entities 
in a fiscally responsible manner, and that reform should reduce the 
current tax rate differences between corporate and pass-through 
entities while maintaining adequate forms of organization for 
businesses.
