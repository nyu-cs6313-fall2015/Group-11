H. Res. 146

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                        April 11, 2013.
    Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to 
consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1120) to prohibit the National Labor 
Relations Board from taking any action that requires a quorum of the members of 
the Board until such time as Board constituting a quorum shall have been 
confirmed by the Senate, the Supreme Court issues a decision on the 
constitutionality of the appointments to the Board made in January 2012, or the 
adjournment sine die of the first session of the 113th Congress. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment in 
the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Education and the 
Workforce now printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute 
consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 113-6, shall be considered as 
adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question 
shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further 
amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce; and (2) one motion to 
recommit with or without instructions.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
