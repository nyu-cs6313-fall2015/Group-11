                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
    Urging the President to immediately request the resignation of 
              Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki.

Whereas Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki is assigned to provide the 
        Nation's veterans the quality of care and benefits they deserve and have 
        earned;
Whereas Secretary Shinseki's poor oversight and failed leadership has led to the 
        tragic and avoidable deaths of some of the Nation's veterans;
Whereas officials of the Department of Veterans Affairs revealed inexcusable 
        delays in providing emergency health care to the Nation's veterans;
Whereas Secretary Shinseki has shown ineffectiveness and a lack of transparency 
        as the top official at the Department of Veterans Affairs;
Whereas the clerks at the Department of Veterans Affairs were instructed how to 
        falsify appointment records to meet agency goals;
Whereas Secretary Shinseki has displayed an unwillingness or inability to change 
        the culture of falsifying documents at the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs;
Whereas Secretary Shinseki has failed to implement modern age technology to 
        reduce backlogs in veterans' claims;
Whereas reports indicate that the Department of Veterans Affairs has paid out 
        more than $200,000,000 in wrongful-death claims to the families of 
        nearly 1,000 veterans since September 11, 2001; and
Whereas veterans have earned the right to have timely access to quality 
        healthcare: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress urges the President, in light of these aforementioned 
failures, to immediately request the resignation of Veterans Affairs 
Secretary Eric Shinseki.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
