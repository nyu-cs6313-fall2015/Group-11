                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring the service of Native American Indians in the United States 
                             Armed Forces.

Whereas Native American Indians have served with distinction in the United 
        States Armed Forces and in military actions for more than 200 years;
Whereas the courage, determination, and fighting spirit of Native American 
        Indians were strengths recognized and valued by American military 
        leaders;
Whereas more than 150,000 Native American Indians have fought for the United 
        States in the struggle for freedom and peace, and often in a percentage 
        well above their percentage of the population of the United States as a 
        whole;
Whereas the Elders of the American Indian Society have proclaimed that official 
        recognition of the military service of Native American Indians would 
        help engender a sense of self-esteem and pride in Native American 
        Indians;
Whereas, although November 11, Veterans Day, marks a day of observance for all 
        veterans who served in the Armed Forces, the establishment of a specific 
        National Native American Indian Veterans Day would honor the service of 
        Native American Indians in the Armed Forces; and
Whereas November 7, a date during the annual Native American Indian Heritage 
        Month, would be an appropriate day to establish as National Native 
        American Indian Veterans Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors the service of Native American Indians in the 
        Armed Forces;
            (2) recommends the establishment of a National Native 
        American Indian Veterans Day;
            (3) encourages all Americans to learn about the history of 
        the service of Native American Indians in the Armed Forces; and
            (4) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling 
        on the people of the United States to observe the day with 
        appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs to demonstrate 
        their support for Native American Indian veterans.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
