		<whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reports as of January 2014 a total

			 refugees and internally displaced persons, many of whom face grave
			 deprivation and imminent threats to life, health, and safety;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas recent extremist attacks on civilians have exacerbated the serious dislocations and
			 pressures facing individuals within this population of concern, and have
			 had a particularly severe effect on ethnic and religious minority
			 communities in the region, where civilians require immediate and urgent
			 access to potable water, health care, fuel, electricity, and basic
			 security;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations Security Council stated on July 22, 2014, <quote>The members of the Security Council further recall that widespread or systematic attacks directed
			 against any civilian populations because of their ethnic background,
			 religious beliefs or faith may constitute a crime against humanity, for
			 which those responsible must be held accountable,</quote> and denounced the persecution of Iraqi Christians and other minorities, including Yizidis and
			 Mandeans;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas reports indicate that some 150,000 Iraqi people in the immediate region of the Nineveh
			 Plain, whose families have a history in the region dating back hundreds
			 and even thousands of years, are now facing ethnic and religious
			 cleansing, persecution, harassment, intimidation, extortion, displacement
			 from their homes, and have been targeted for retribution by extremist
			 elements affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS);</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2165 (July 14, 2014), which can
			 provide guidance for urgent action in Iraq, as it addresses similarly
			 grave humanitarian needs in neighboring Syria;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Iraqi civilians in the Nineveh Plain region require immediate protection from armed
			 militants and urgent humanitarian assistance; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the grave humanitarian crisis in the Nineveh Plain region has serious potential
			 implications for the broader stability of Iraq and other nations in the
