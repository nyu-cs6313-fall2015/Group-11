		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Sailors of the United States Submarine Force recently completed the 4,000th deterrent
			 patrol of a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN);</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas this milestone is significant for the Submarine Force, its crews and their families, the

		</whereas>
    <whereas>

			 patrol of USS George Washington (SSBN 598) in 1960;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas, as a result of the dedication and commitment to excellence of the Sailors of the United

			 who might seek to do harm to the United States or United States allies;</text>
		</whereas>

			 allies: Now, therefore, be it</text>
