                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the formation of a bipartisan Presidential Commission to 
  study the establishment of a National Museum of the American People.

Whereas the United States was created and built by peoples from every land, and 
        these people made this Nation the world's economic, military, 
        scientific, and cultural leader;
Whereas Canada and Mexico, the nations bordering the United States, have major 
        museums in or near their capital cities telling the story of the making 
        of their peoples;
Whereas the people of the United States do not have a comprehensive and accurate 
        picture of all the peoples who created and continue to build the Nation;
Whereas few foreigners know the story of the peoples who came to be citizens of 
        the United States, nor the story of the people from their own nations 
        who came to this land;
Whereas a museum telling the story of the making of the people of the United 
        States and celebrating all who migrated and settled in the present day 
        United States, from the very first to the most recent, belongs near the 
        National Mall in Washington, DC;
Whereas the National Museum of the American People would serve as a resource to 
        assist State, local, and ethnic museums throughout the Nation present 
        exhibits that celebrate the heritage of the people of the United States;
Whereas non-Federal sources will be sought to provide full funding for a 
        Presidential Commission to study establishment of the Museum and that 
        such sums will commence when the President signs an Executive order 
        creating a bipartisan Presidential Commission; and
Whereas non-Federal sources are anticipated to provide full funding to design 
        and build the Museum, its exhibitions and its components: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress supports the establishment of a bipartisan Presidential 
Commission to study the establishment of a National Museum of the 
American People to tell the immigration and migration stories of all 
people in the United States.
                                 <all>
