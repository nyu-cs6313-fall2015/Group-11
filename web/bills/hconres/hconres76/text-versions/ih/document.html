                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the significance of the anniversary of the American 
     Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Science and 
Technology Policy Fellowship program, and reaffirming the commitment to 
support the use of science in governmental decisionmaking through such 
                                program.

Whereas Congress hosted the American Association for the Advancement of 
        Science's (AAAS) first Congressional Science and Engineering Fellows 40 
        years ago in 1973;
Whereas the AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering Fellowship program was 
        the first to provide an opportunity for doctoral-level scientists and 
        engineers to learn about the policymaking process while bolstering the 
        technical expertise available to Members of Congress and staff;
Whereas Members of Congress hold the AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering 
        Fellowship program in high regard for the substantial contributions that 
        Fellows have made, serving in nearly 100 Congressional offices and 
        committees, as well as the Congressional Research Service, Government 
        Accountability Office, and the former Office of Technology Assessment;
Whereas the Congress is increasingly required to legislate on public policy 
        issues of a scientific and technical nature and recognizes the need to 
        develop additional in-house expertise in the areas of science and 
        engineering;
Whereas nearly 1,200 individuals have held AAAS Congressional Science and 
        Engineering Fellowships since 1973;
Whereas more than 1,400 individuals, across 20 Federal agencies and departments, 
        have held the AAAS Executive Branch Science and Technology Policy 
        Fellowships since its launch in 1980;
Whereas in total more than 2,600 Science and Technology Policy Fellows have had 
        the opportunity to contribute knowledge and analytical skills in service 
        to the United States Government;
Whereas over four decades AAAS has partnered with more than 60 professional 
        societies and organizations to sponsor Science and Technology Policy 
        Fellows;
Whereas the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows represent the full range 
        of physical, biological, and social sciences, and all fields of 
        engineering;
Whereas the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows bring to Congress and the 
        Executive Branch new insights and ideas, extensive knowledge, and 
        perspectives from a variety of disciplines;
Whereas the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows learn about the 
        development and implementation of policy, stakeholder outreach, and 
        communications through assignments that offer a wide array of 
        responsibilities;
Whereas AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellowships provide an opportunity 
        for scientists and engineers to transition into careers in government 
        service; and
Whereas many former AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows return to their 
        disciplines and share knowledge with students and peers to encourage 
        more scientists and engineers to participate in informing government 
        processes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That the Congress--
            (1) recognizes the significance of the anniversary of the 
        American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) 
        Science and Technology Policy Fellowship program;
            (2) acknowledges the value of 40 years of participation by 
        the American Association for the Advancement of Science's 
        Science and Technology Policy Fellows; and
            (3) reaffirms its commitment to support the use of science 
        in governmental decisionmaking through the American Association 
        for the Advancement of Science's Science and Technology Policy 
        Fellowship program.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
