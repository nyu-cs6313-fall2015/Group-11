                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the need for the continued 
 availability of religious services to members of the Armed Forces and 
            their families during a lapse in appropriations.

Whereas the Department of Defense has determined that some military chaplains 
        and other personnel, including contract personnel, hired to perform 
        duties of a military chaplain are not able to perform religious services 
        on military installations during a lapse in appropriations;
Whereas this determination threatens the ability of members of the Armed 
        Services and their families to

              

 exercise their First Amendment rights to worship and participate in 
religious activities; and

Whereas the Department of the Interior has permitted the performance of First 
        Amendment activities in areas controlled by the National Park Service 
        despite the lapse in appropriations: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) recognizes that the performance of religious services 
        and the provision of ministry are protected activities under 
        the First Amendment of the United States Constitution;
            (2) urges and intends that the Secretary of Defense permit 
        the performance of religious services on property owned or 
        maintained by the Department of Defense, during any lapse in 
        appropriations, in the same manner and to the same extent as 
        such religious services are otherwise available; and
            (3) urges and intends that the Secretary of Defense permit 
        military chaplains and other personnel, including contract 
        personnel, hired to perform duties of a military chaplain to 
        perform religious services and ministry, during any lapse in 
        appropriations, in the same manner and to the same extent as 
        such chaplains and other personnel are otherwise permitted to 
        perform religious services and ministry.

            Passed the House of Representatives October 5, 2013.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
