[From the U.S. Government Printing Office]
[H. Con. Res. 58 Engrossed Amendment Senate (EAS)]

                  In the Senate of the United States,

                                                      October 10, 2013.
    Resolved, That the resolution from the House of Representatives (H. 
Con. Res. 58) entitled ``Concurrent resolution expressing the sense of 
Congress regarding the need for the continued availability of religious 
services to members of the Armed Forces and their families during a 
lapse in appropriations.'', do pass with the following

                              AMENDMENTS:

(1)Strike the preamble and insert the following:
Whereas the Department of Defense determined that some contractor clergy, like 
        other Department of Defense contractors, were unable to perform their 
        contractual duties during the current lapse in appropriations;
Whereas this determination may have impacted the ability of members of the Armed 
        Forces and their families to worship and participate in religious 
        activities;
Whereas military chaplains on active duty, like all military personnel on active 
        duty, continue to perform their duties during the current lapse in 
        appropriations;
Whereas the Department continues to analyze its authorities under the Pay Our 
        Military Act (Public Law 113-39) with respect to contractors; and
Whereas the Pay Our Military Act appropriates such sums as are necessary to pay 
        contractors of the Department whom the Secretary of Defense determines 
        are providing support to members of the Armed Forces: Now, therefore, be 
        it

(2)On page 2, strike line 3 and all that follows through page 3, line 
2, and insert the following:
            (1) finds that the provision and availability of religious 
        services and clergy is important to the morale and wellbeing of 
        many members of the Armed Forces and their families; and
            (2) hopes the Secretary of Defense is able to determine 
        that contractor clergy provide necessary support to military 
        personnel, and would therefore be covered under the 
        appropriations made available under the Pay Our Military Act 
        (Public Law 113-39).

            Attest:

                                                                      Secretary.
