                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the sense of Congress that health workers deserve our 
profound gratitude and respect for their commitments and sacrifices in 
             addressing the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

Whereas the current Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone is the 
        first Ebola outbreak in West Africa and by far the largest Ebola 
        outbreak ever;
Whereas the Ebola Virus Disease is a severe acute viral illness that has 
        symptoms that are also common to other viruses, such as fever, muscle 
        pain, and intestinal problems, making it difficult to properly identify;
Whereas Ebola outbreaks are characterized by human-to-human transmission of the 
        virus through direct contact with blood, body fluids, and tissues of 
        infected people such as through needle sticks, unprotected care of 
        infected individuals, and unsafe funeral preparation or burial 
        ceremonies;
Whereas Ebola outbreaks historically have a case fatality rate of up to 90 
        percent;
Whereas there is currently no licensed vaccine for Ebola or treatment for Ebola 
        other than supportive care;
Whereas according to the World Health Organization, as of November 12, 2014, 
        Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have reported 14,098 suspected, 
        probable, and confirmed cases since December 2013;
Whereas the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 
        for every case reported an additional 1.5 cases are not recorded;
Whereas second order impacts of the Ebola outbreak are threatening local public 
        health systems, economic and food security, and political stability;
Whereas the Ebola virus threatens to destabilize the nascent political systems 
        in affected countries and disrupt the free flow of people and goods in a 
        globalized world economy;
Whereas the United States cannot truly protect itself from the Ebola crisis 
        without ending the outbreak in West Africa;
Whereas the United States has addressed the crisis by disbursing over 
        $414,000,000 to date, deploying a Disaster Assistance Response Team 
        (DART) to coordinate the United States Government response in West 
        Africa, sending United States military and broader uniformed services to 
        support logistics, training, and engineering;
Whereas the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2015 included $88,000,000 to 
        support the international response to the outbreak and to invest in the 
        research and development of Ebola vaccines and treatments;
Whereas at the time of the initial outbreak many health workers in West Africa 
        did not have proper training or experience to recognize, diagnose, and 
        care for Ebola patients and prevent transmission;
Whereas the United States is helping to train health workers from member states 
        of the African Union to directly respond to medical needs in Guinea, 
        Liberia, and Sierra Leone, but more trained workers are still needed;
Whereas nongovernmental organizations such as Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the 
        International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, 
        American Jewish World Service, International Medical Corps, 
        International Rescue Committee, Partners in Health, Samaritan's Purse, 
        Global Communities, and many more are responding to the crisis;
Whereas the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the 
        Center for International Disaster Information operate a database for 
        medical professionals in the United States who are willing to go 
        overseas to fight Ebola;
Whereas, as of November 10, 2014, USAID has received nearly 4,800 self-
        nominated, non-vetted volunteers through the usaid.gov online 
        registration portal for health care volunteers and passing these 
        contacts to interested aid organizations working in the region for 
        vetting, possible selection, and training;
Whereas MSF has said what is needed most to fight the epidemic in West Africa is 
        not cash contributions, but rather additional health workers;
Whereas according to the World Health Organization, over 540 health workers in 
        West Africa, including several United States citizens, have been 
        infected in the current outbreak and over 310 have died;
Whereas 2 nurses contracted Ebola while treating a patient in the United States, 
        and have since recovered; and
Whereas the United States Government, in cooperation with international 
        partners, must do everything possible to protect health workers who may 
        come into contact with Ebola, such as by procuring additional units of 
        personal protective equipment (PPE) and investing in research and 
        development of better methods of protection: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) recognizes and honors the commitment, courage, and 
        sacrifices made by medical professionals, national and 
        community health care workers, government officials, military 
        personnel, nongovernmental organizations, members of civil 
        society, faith leaders, and volunteers engaged in the effort to 
        combat and contain the Ebola Virus Disease, thereby saving 
        countless lives;
            (2) calls on research and development groups and medical 
        device companies to develop better ways to protect health 
        workers from Ebola infection;
            (3) remains committed to mobilizing the resources and 
        personnel necessary to help fight the spread of this disease to 
        save lives and to protect the national security and global 
        health interests of the United States;
            (4) calls on the international community to increase its 
        commitments of resources, services, and personnel to assist 
        affected nations in addressing the current epidemic; and
            (5) recognizes the need to address long-term solutions to 
        the Ebola epidemic, including by helping to build resilient 
        public health systems.
