  <summary>11/14/2014--Introduced.
Honors the commitment, courage, and sacrifices made by medical professionals, health care workers, government officials, military personnel, nongovernmental organizations, members of civil society, faith leaders, and volunteers engaged in the effort to combat Ebola.

Calls on: (1) research and development groups and medical device companies to develop better ways to protect health workers from Ebola infection; and (2) the international community to increase its commitments of resources, services, and personnel to assist affected nations in addressing Ebola.

Remains committed to mobilizing the resources and personnel necessary to fight the spread of Ebola and to protect U.S. national security and global health interests.

Recognizes the need to address long-term solutions to Ebola, including by helping to build resilient public health systems.</summary>
