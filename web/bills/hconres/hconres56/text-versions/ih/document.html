                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           September 18, 2013

     referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of Congress that a certain lock and dam should be 
     known and designated as the ``Donald G. Waldon Lock and Dam''.

Whereas the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Development Authority is a 4-State 
        compact comprised of the States of Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and 
        Tennessee;
Whereas the Tennessee-Tombigbee Authority is the regional non-Federal sponsor of 
        the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway;
Whereas the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, completed in 1984, has fueled growth 
        in the United States economy by reducing transportation costs and 
        encouraging economic development; and
Whereas the selfless determination and tireless work of Donald G. Waldon, while 
        serving as administrator of the waterway compact for 21 years, 
        contributed greatly to the realization and success of the Tennessee-
        Tombigbee Waterway: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that at an appropriate time and in 
accordance with the rules of the House of Representatives and the 
Senate, the lock and dam located at mile 357.5 on the Tennessee-
Tombigbee Waterway should be known and designated as the ``Donald G. 
Waldon Lock and Dam''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
