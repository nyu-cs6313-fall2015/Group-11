                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            January 3, 2013

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress that the use of offensive military 
force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of 
 Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under 
               article II, section 4 of the Constitution.

Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congress' exclusive power to 
        declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that, except in response to an actual 
or imminent attack against the territory of the United States, the use 
of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear 
authorization of an Act of Congress violates Congress' exclusive power 
to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the 
Constitution and therefore constitutes an impeachable high crime and 
misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.
