                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
    To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against the 
terrorist organization Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (``ISIL'').

Whereas for months Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (``ISIL'') has been 
        engaged in an almost unchecked campaign of murder and mayhem across a 
        broad swath of Iraq and Syria that has killed thousands of innocent 
        people and terrorized millions;
Whereas ISIL has brought under its control large areas of Iraq and Syria and 
        announced on June 29, 2014, the establishment of a new caliphate;
Whereas in its conduct of military operations, its treatment of personnel 
        captured on the battlefield, and its behavior towards civilians in areas 
        under its control, ISIL has shown a level of brutality and depravity 
        that shocks the conscience;
Whereas ISIL brutally murdered two American journalists and a British aid worker 
        and has threatened the lives of other western hostages;
Whereas the threat posed by the recruitment of ISIL fighters in the United 
        States and Europe and the prospect of these fighters returning to the 
        United States or allied countries jeopardizes the security of the United 
        States and its allies;
Whereas ISIL poses an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security 
        and foreign policy of the United States and if left unchecked will be 
        the locus of plots to attack our homeland;
Whereas the rise of ISIL, the continuing threat posed by al Qaeda, and the 
        pending redeployment of United States combat troops from Afghanistan 
        highlight the need to re-examine and harmonize the legal authorities 
        under which the President is authorized to take offensive military 
        action; and
Whereas the President has authority under the Constitution to take action to 
        protect the United States and its citizens from imminent threat or 
        attack but Congress alone holds the power to declare war: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,
