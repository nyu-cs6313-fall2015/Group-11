  Conferring honorary citizenship of the United States on Bernardo de 
      Galvez y Madrid, Viscount of Galveston and Count of Galvez.

Whereas the United States has conferred honorary citizenship on 7 other 
        occasions during its history, and honorary citizenship is and should 
        remain an extraordinary honor not lightly conferred nor frequently 
        granted;
Whereas Bernardo de Galvez y Madrid, Viscount of Galveston and Count of Galvez, 
        was a hero of the Revolutionary War who risked his life for the freedom 
        of the United States people and provided supplies, intelligence, and 
        strong military support to the war effort;
Whereas Bernardo de Galvez recruited an army of 7,500 men made up of Spanish, 
        French, African-American, Mexican, Cuban, and Anglo-American forces and 
        led the effort of Spain to aid the United States' colonists against 
        Great Britain;
Whereas during the Revolutionary War, Bernardo de Galvez and his troops seized 
        the Port of New Orleans and successfully defeated the British at battles 
        in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Natchez, Mississippi, and Mobile, Alabama;
Whereas Bernardo de Galvez led the successful 2-month Siege of Pensacola, 
        Florida, where his troops captured the capital of British West Florida 
        and left the British with no naval bases in the Gulf of Mexico;
Whereas Bernardo de Galvez was wounded during the Siege of Pensacola, 
        demonstrating bravery that forever endeared him to the United States 
        soldiers;
Whereas Bernardo de Galvez's victories against the British were recognized by 
        George Washington as a deciding factor in the outcome of the 
        Revolutionary War;
Whereas Bernardo de Galvez helped draft the terms of treaty that ended the 
        Revolutionary War;
Whereas the United States Continental Congress declared, on October 31, 1778, 
        their gratitude and favorable sentiments to Bernardo de Galvez for his 
        conduct towards the United States;
Whereas after the war, Bernardo de Galvez served as viceroy of New Spain and led 
        the effort to chart the Gulf of Mexico, including Galveston Bay, the 
        largest bay on the Texas coast;
Whereas several geographic locations, including Galveston Bay, Galveston, Texas, 
        Galveston County, Texas, Galvez, Louisiana, and St. Bernard Parish, 
        Louisiana, are named after Bernardo de Galvez;
Whereas the State of Florida has honored Bernardo de Galvez with the designation 
        of Great Floridian; and
Whereas Bernardo de Galvez played an integral role in the Revolutionary War and 
        helped secure the independence of the United States: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That Bernardo de Galvez y 
Madrid, Viscount of Galveston and Count of Galvez, is proclaimed 
posthumously to be an honorary citizen of the United States.
