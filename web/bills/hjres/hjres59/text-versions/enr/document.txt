SEC. 1002. FINDINGS; PURPOSE STATEMENT.

    In order to support the provision of quality care for our nation's 
seniors, Congress finds it appropriate to reform physician 
reimbursements under the Medicare program. SGR reform legislation 
provides such an opportunity, but not until next year. In order to 
facilitate such reform, Congress finds that the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services should continue to focus its efforts on the following 
areas:
        (1) Simplify and reduce administrative burden on physicians.--
    The application and assessment of measures and other activities 
    under SGR reform should be facilitated by the Centers for Medicare 
    and Medicaid Services (CMS) in a way that accounts for the 
    administrative burden such measurement places on physicians. 
    Therefore, the Congress encourages CMS to identify and implement, 
    to the extent practicable, mechanisms to ensure that the 
    application and assessment of measures be coordinated across 
    programs.
        (2) Timely feedback for physicians.--In order for measure and 
    assessment programs to encourage the highest quality care for 
    Medicare seniors, the Congress finds it critical that CMS provide 
    physicians with feedback on performance in as close to real time as 
    possible. Such timely feedback will ensure that physicians can 
    excel under a system of meaningful measurement.
        (3) Encourage development of new models.--There is great need 
    to test alternatives to Fee-For-Service reimbursement in the 
    Medicare program. One option is the promotion and adoption of new 
    models of care for physicians. To date, there has been significant 
    development and testing of models for primary care. Congress 
    supports these efforts and encourages them to continue in the 
    future. Congress also encourages the development and testing of 
    models of specialty care.
