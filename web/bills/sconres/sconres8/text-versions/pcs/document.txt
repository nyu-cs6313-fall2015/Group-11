conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in relation 
to, a bill, upon a point of order being made by any Senator pursuant to 
this section, and such point of order being sustained, such material 
contained in such conference report shall be stricken, and the Senate 
shall proceed to consider the question of whether the Senate shall 
recede from its amendment and concur with a further amendment, or 
concur in the House amendment with a further amendment, as the case may 
be, which further amendment shall consist of only that portion of the 
conference report or House amendment, as the case may be, not so 
stricken. Any such motion in the Senate shall be debatable. In any case 
in which such point of order is sustained against a conference report 
(or Senate amendment derived from such conference report by operation 
of this subsection), no further amendment shall be in order.
    (f) Inapplicability.--In the Senate, section 402 of S. Con. Res. 13 
(111th Congress) shall no longer apply.

SEC. 403. ADJUSTMENTS FOR SEQUESTRATION OR SEQUESTRATION REPLACEMENT.

    (a) Adjustments Under Current Law.--If the enforcement procedures 
established under section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985 and section 901(e) of the American Taxpayer 
Relief Act of 2012 go into, or remain in effect, the Chairman of the 
Committee on the Budget of the Senate may adjust the allocation called 
for in section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 
633(a)) to the appropriate committee or committees of the Senate, and 
may adjust all other budgetary aggregates, allocations, levels, and 
limits contained in this resolution, as necessary, consistent with such 
enforcement.
    (b) Adjustments if Amended.--If a measure becomes law that amends 
the discretionary spending limits established under section 251(c) of 
the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the 
adjustments to discretionary spending limits under section 251(b) of 
that Act, or the enforcement procedures established under section 251A 
of that Act or section 901(e) of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 
2012, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may 
adjust the allocation called for in section 302(a) of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 633(a)) to the appropriate committee or 
committees of the Senate, and may adjust all other budgetary 
aggregates, allocations, levels, and limits contained in this 
resolution, as necessary, consistent with such measure.

SEC. 404. SENATE POINT OF ORDER AGAINST PROVISIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS 
              LEGISLATION THAT CONSTITUTE CHANGES IN MANDATORY PROGRAMS 
              AFFECTING THE CRIME VICTIMS FUND.

    (a) In General.--In the Senate, it shall not be in order to 
consider any appropriations legislation, including any amendment 
thereto, motion in relation thereto, or conference report thereon, that 
includes any provision or provisions affecting the Crime Victims Fund 
(as established by section 1402 of Public Law 98-473 (42 U.S.C. 10601)) 
which constitutes a change in a mandatory program that would have been 
estimated as affecting direct spending or receipts under section 252 of 
the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as in 
effect prior to September 30, 2002) were they included in legislation 
other than appropriations legislation. A point of order pursuant to 
this section shall be raised against such provision or provisions as 
described in subsections (d) and (e).
    (b) Determination.--The determination of whether a provision is 
subject to a point of order pursuant to this section shall be made by 
the Committee on the Budget of the Senate.
    (c) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be waived or 
suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of 
the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths 
of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required 
to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order 
raised under this section.
    (d) General Point of Order.--It shall be in order for a Senator to 
raise a single point of order that several provisions of a bill, 
resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report violate this 
section. The Presiding Officer may sustain the point of order as to 
some or all of the provisions against which the Senator raised the 
point of order. If the Presiding Officer so sustains the point of order 
as to some of the provisions (including provisions of an amendment, 
motion, or conference report) against which the Senator raised the 
point of order, then only those provisions (including provision of an 
amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the Presiding 
Officer sustains the point of order shall be deemed stricken pursuant 
to this section. Before the Presiding Officer rules on such a point of 
order, any Senator may move to waive such a point of order as it 
applies to some or all of the provisions against which the point of 
order was raised. Such a motion to waive is amendable in accordance 
with rules and precedents of the Senate. After the Presiding Officer 
rules on such a point of order, any Senator may appeal the ruling of 
the Presiding Officer on such a point of order as it applies to some or 
all of the provisions on which the Presiding Officer ruled.
    (e) Form of the Point of Order.--When the Senate is considering a 
conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in relation 
to, a bill, upon a point of order being made by any Senator pursuant to 
this section, and such point of order being sustained, such material 
contained in such conference report or amendment shall be deemed 
stricken, and the Senate shall proceed to consider the question of 
whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment and concur with a 
further amendment, or concur in the House amendment with a further 
amendment, as the case may be, which further amendment shall consist of 
only that portion of the conference report or House amendment, as the 
case may be, not so stricken. Any such motion shall be debatable. In 
any case in which such point of order is sustained against a conference 
report (or Senate amendment derived from such conference report by 
operation of this subsection), no further amendment shall be in order.

Accountability Office's High Risk list and the annual report to reduce 
program duplication. Based on these oversight efforts and performance 
reviews of programs within their jurisdiction, committees are directed 
to include recommendations for improved governmental performance in

Code, the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference 
report on any concurrent resolution on the budget shall include in its

SEC. 413. APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS AND 
              AGGREGATES.

    (a) Application.--Any adjustments of allocations and aggregates 
made pursuant to this resolution shall--
            (1) apply while that measure is under consideration;
            (2) take effect upon the enactment of that measure; and
            (3) be published in the Congressional Record as soon as 
        practicable.
    (b) Effect of Changed Allocations and Aggregates.--Revised 
allocations and aggregates resulting from these adjustments shall be 
considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as 
allocations and aggregates contained in this resolution.
    (c) Budget Committee Determinations.--For purposes of this 
resolution the levels of new budget authority, outlays, direct 
spending, new entitlement authority, revenues, deficits, and surpluses 
for a fiscal year or period of fiscal years shall be determined on the 
basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the Senate.

SEC. 414. ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS.

    Upon the enactment of a bill or joint resolution providing for a 
change in concepts or definitions, the Chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget of the Senate may make adjustments to the levels and allocations 
in this resolution in accordance with section 251(b) of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.

SEC. 415. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.

    Congress adopts the provisions of this title--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, 
        and as such they shall be considered as part of the rules of 
        the Senate and such rules shall supersede other rules only to 
        the extent that they are inconsistent with such other rules; 
        and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        the Senate to change those rules at any time, in the same 
        manner, and to the same extent as is the case of any other rule 
        of the Senate.

                         TITLE V--OTHER MATTERS

SEC. 501. TO REQUIRE TRANSPARENT REPORTING ON THE ONGOING COSTS TO 
              TAXPAYERS OF OBAMACARE.
