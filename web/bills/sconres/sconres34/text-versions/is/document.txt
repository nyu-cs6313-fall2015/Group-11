                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 25, 2014

Mr. Rubio (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Cornyn, 
     Mr. Walsh, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Risch) submitted the following 
 concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of Congress that the President should hold the 
  Russian Federation accountable for being in material breach of its 
    obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

Whereas the Russian Federation is in material breach of its obligations under 
        the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet 
        Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and 
        Shorter-Range Missiles, commonly referred to as the Intermediate-Range 
        Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and 
        entered into force June 1, 1988; and
Whereas such behavior poses a threat to the United States, its deployed forces, 
        and its allies: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should hold the Russian Federation 
        accountable for being in material breach of its obligations 
        under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty;
            (2) the President should demand the Russian Federation 
        completely and verifiably eliminate the military systems that 
        constitute the material breach of its obligations under the 
        Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty;
            (3) the President should not engage in further reductions 
        of United States nuclear forces generally and should not engage 
        in nuclear arms reduction negotiations with the Russian 
        Federation specifically until such complete and verifiable 
        elimination of the military systems has occurred; and
            (4) the President, in consultation with United States 
        allies, should consider whether it is in the national security 
        interests of the United States to unilaterally remain a party 
        to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty if the Russian 
        Federation is still in material breach of such Treaty beginning 
        one year after the date of the adoption of this concurrent 
        resolution.
                                 <all>
