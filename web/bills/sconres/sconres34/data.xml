  <summary>3/25/2014--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should: (1) hold the Russian Federation accountable for being in material breach of its obligations under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; (2) demand that the Russian Federation eliminate the military systems that constitute such material breach; (3) not engage in further reductions of U.S. nuclear forces and not engage in nuclear arms reduction negotiations with the Russian Federation until such military systems have been eliminated; and (4) consider, in consultation with U.S. allies, whether it is in U.S. national security interests to remain unilaterally a party to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty if the Russian Federation is still in material breach of it after one year.</summary>
