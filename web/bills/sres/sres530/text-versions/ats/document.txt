                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate on the current situation in Iraq and 
 the urgent need to protect religious minorities from persecution from 
  the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

Whereas Iraq is currently embroiled in a surge of violence arising from an ISIL-
        led offensive that began in Anbar province and has spread to key 
        locations such as Mosul, Tikrit, and Samarra and continues to engulf the 
        region in violence and instability;
Whereas, on June 29, 2014, ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi renamed the group 
        the Islamic State and pronounced himself Caliph of a new Islamic 
        caliphate encompassing the areas under his control, and Mr. al-Baghdadi 
        has a stated mission of spreading the Islamic State and caliphate across 
        the region through violence against Shiites, non-Muslims, and 
        unsupportive Sunnis;
Whereas Iraq's population is approximately 31,300,000 people, with 97 percent 
        identifying themselves as Muslim and the approximately 3 percent of 
        religious minorities groups comprising of Christians, Yezidis, Sabean-
        Mandaeans, Bahais, Shabaks, Kakais, and Jews;
Whereas the Iraqi Christian population is estimated to be between 400,000 and 
        850,000, with two-thirds being Chaldean, one-fifth Assyrian, and the 
        remainder consisting of Syriacs, Protestants, Armenians, and Anglicans;
Whereas the Iraqi constitution provides for religious freedom by stating that 
        ``no law may be enacted that contradicts the principles of democracy,'' 
        ``no law may be enacted that contradicts the rights and basic freedoms 
        stipulated in this Constitution,'' and ``[this Constitution] guarantees 
        the full religious rights to freedom of religious belief and practice of 
        all individuals such as Christians, Yazidis, and Mandean Sabeans'';
Whereas the fall of Mosul in particular has sparked enough anxiety among the 
        Christian population that, for the first time in 1,600 years, there was 
        no Mass in that city;
Whereas over 50 percent of Iraq's Christian population has fled since the fall 
        of Saddam Hussein, and the government under Prime Minister Nouri al-
        Maliki did not uphold its commitment to protect the rights of religious 
        minorities;
Whereas the United States Government has provided over $73,000,000 of cumulative 
        assistance to Iraq's minority populations since 2003 through economic 
        development, humanitarian services, and capacity development;
Whereas 84,902 Iraqis have resettled to the United States between 2007 and 2013 
        and over 300,000 Chaldean and Assyrians currently reside throughout the 
        country, particularly in Michigan, California, Arizona, Illinois, and 
        Ohio; and
Whereas President Barack Obama recently declared on Religious Freedom Day, 
        ``Foremost among the rights Americans hold sacred is the freedom to 
        worship as we choose . . . we also remember that religious liberty is 
        not just an American right; it is a universal human right to be 
        protected here at home and across the globe. This freedom is an 
        essential part of human dignity, and without it our world cannot know 
        lasting peace.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) reaffirms its commitment to promoting and to protecting 
        religious freedom around the world;
            (2) calls on the Department of State to work with the 
        Government of Iraq, the Kurdistan Regional Government, 
        neighboring countries, the diaspora community in the United 
        States, and other key stakeholders to address the urgent plight 
        of those Iraqi minority groups seeking safety and protection 
        from persecution in Iraq;
            (3) respectfully requests the Government of Iraq to 
        prioritize the issue of protecting religious minorities and 
        take concrete action to enact and enforce laws protecting 
        religious freedom; and
            (4) urges the President to ensure the timely processing of 
        visas for Iraq's minority groups fleeing religious persecution, 
        in accordance with existing United States immigration law and 
        national security screening procedures.
                                 <all>
