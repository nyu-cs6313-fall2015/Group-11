                               RESOLUTION


 
Congratulating the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee on the 
  celebration of its 100th anniversary and commending its significant 
 contribution to empower and revitalize developing communities around 
                               the world.

Whereas the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (referred to in this 
        preamble as the ``JDC''), the leading Jewish humanitarian assistance 
        organization in the world, provides economic relief to communities 
        facing hardship and builds the foundation for self-sustaining Jewish 
        community life;
Whereas when the JDC was founded in 1914, the organization initiated relief 
        projects in communities primarily in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, 
        and, as of November 2013, the JDC works in 70 countries worldwide and 
        touches more than 1,000,000 lives each year;
Whereas the JDC has pioneered high-impact programs that provide access to 
        education, health care, food, shelter, and assistance with job training 
        and placement for governments and other organizations to utilize;
Whereas the JDC has developed and implemented initiatives in Israeli society 
        aimed at meeting the needs of the most disadvantaged citizens in the 
        State of Israel, including children and youth at risk, the chronically 
        unemployed (including ultra-Orthodox Jews, people with disabilities, and 
        Israeli Arabs), and the elderly;
Whereas the JDC received the Israel Prize in 2007 for its lifetime achievements 
        and special contributions to society and the State of Israel for 
        developing innovative, scalable solutions to meet the needs of the most 
        disadvantaged citizens in the State of Israel;
Whereas the JDC has helped transform the lives of women and girls throughout the 
        world, through initiatives that provide access to health care and 
        education to girls, encouraging them to overcome gender barriers, 
        receive an education, and become community leaders;
Whereas the JDC is engaging many young individuals in the United States to 
        participate in rescue, renewal, and revitalization work through service 
        and volunteer programs around the world;
Whereas the JDC and the United States Government have a historic and enduring 
        relationship that has evolved from cooperating in life-saving work in 
        Europe through the American Relief Administration following World War I 
        and the War Refugee Board during World War II to the more recent 
        partnerships between the JDC and the Department of Agriculture, the 
        Department of State, and the United States Agency for International 
        Development;
Whereas the JDC mobilizes its expert professionals and network of local, United 
        States, Israeli, and global partners, including the Jewish Coalition for 
        Disaster Relief, to provide immediate relief and long-term assistance in 
        the aftermath of natural disasters, such as by providing emergency 
        supplies and medical assistance following the earthquake and tsunami in 
        Japan in 2011 and the earthquake in Haiti in 2010; and
Whereas the JDC creates programs and solutions that benefit the neediest 
        populations in communities around the world and confronts the most 
        difficult challenges, such as natural disasters, extreme poverty, 
        political instability, and genocide: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes and celebrates the 100th anniversary of the 
        founding of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee; 
        and
            (2) commends the American Jewish Joint Distribution 
        Committee on its valuable work around the world and wishes the 
        organization success in its future efforts.
                                 <all>
