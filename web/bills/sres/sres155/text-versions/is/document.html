                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the City of Erie, Pennsylvania, for its critical role in 
   the development and construction of the fleet of Commodore Oliver 
                  Hazard Perry during the War of 1812.

Whereas the City of Erie, Pennsylvania, due to its abundant resources and 
        strategic positioning, was recommended by shipbuilder Daniel Dobbins to 
        the United States Department of the Navy as an ideal location for the 
        construction of a naval fleet;
Whereas the victory by the United States over Great Britain in the Battle of 
        Lake Erie on September 10, 1813, was a crucial victory for the United 
        States during the War of 1812, and ensured that the United States 
        maintained control over Lake Erie for the duration of the war;
Whereas the success of the fleet of Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry in the Battle 
        of Lake Erie helped to facilitate the important victory of General 
        William Henry Harrison at the Battle of the Thames, as well as other 
        military actions of the United States throughout the War of 1812;
Whereas the USS Lawrence and the USS Niagara, 2 flagships of the fleet of 
        Commodore Perry, were returned to Presque Isle Bay, off the coast of the 
        City of Erie, after completion of their service;
Whereas the City of Erie is home to the USS Niagara, which continues to sail in 
        memory of the heroism of the United States forces in the Battle of Lake 
        Erie;
Whereas the City of Erie honors the legacy of Commodore Perry through the Perry 
        Monument at Presque Isle State Park; and
Whereas the City of Erie this year is recognizing the 200th anniversary of the 
        Battle of Lake Erie: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors the City of Erie, Pennsylvania, for its role in 
        the development and construction of the fleet of Commodore 
        Oliver Hazard Perry during the War of 1812; and
            (2) recognizes the historical significance of the 
        construction of the fleet of Commodore Perry and the consequent 
        victory of the United States in the Battle of Lake Erie.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
