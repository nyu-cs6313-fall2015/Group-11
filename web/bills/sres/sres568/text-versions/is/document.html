                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 18, 2014

 Mr. Schumer submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
                     the Committee on the Judiciary

                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the month of September 2014 as ``National Sepsis Awareness 
                                Month''.

Whereas sepsis is a medical condition resulting from an immune system response 
        to an infection;
Whereas the overwhelming flood of immune chemicals released into the blood to 
        fight an infection can impair blood flow, injuring organs;
Whereas sepsis is a serious community-acquired infection and a leading cause of 
        death in the United States;
Whereas in severe cases of sepsis, a patient can experience a drop in blood 
        pressure, a weakened heart, and septic shock, causing potentially fatal 
        multiple organ failure;
Whereas approximately 1,000,000 individuals in the United States are infected 
        with sepsis each year;
Whereas sepsis has killed over 4,000,000 individuals in the United States 
        between 2004 and 2014;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 
        approximately 50 percent of individuals infected with sepsis die, 
        accounting for more deaths in the United States than prostate cancer, 
        breast cancer, and AIDS combined;
Whereas according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, sepsis is 
        the most expensive cause of hospitalization in the United States, with 
        an annual cost of $24,000,000,000;
Whereas the number of sepsis deaths is on the rise in the United States;
Whereas an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reports 
        that more than 80 percent of individuals who die from sepsis arrive at 
        the hospital with sepsis;
Whereas early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment can prevent sepsis 
        fatalities; and
Whereas September 2014 is an appropriate month to designate as ``National Sepsis 
        Awareness Month'' to raise awareness of sepsis and encourage educating 
        patients, families, health care professionals, and government agencies 
        on the importance of early detection as the key for patients to survive 
        sepsis: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates the month of September 2014 as 
``National Sepsis Awareness Month''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
