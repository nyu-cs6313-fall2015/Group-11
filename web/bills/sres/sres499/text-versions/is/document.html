        annually; and
Whereas the American Motorcyclist Association's headquarters in Pickerington, 
        Ohio, is home to the American Motorcyclist Association Motorcycle Hall 
        of Fame, which honors those who have contributed to the history of 
        motorcycling through political activism, culture, and sport, and which 
        preserves the heritage of motorcycling for future generations: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the American Motorcyclist

protecting the rights and interests of motorcyclists and motorcycle
