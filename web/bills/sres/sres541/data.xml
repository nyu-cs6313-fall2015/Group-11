Recognizes: (1) the threat that Ebola poses to populations, governments, and economies in Africa; and (2) that the limited capacity of the initial outbreak countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia to combat the epidemic has been exhausted and the potential threat to regions beyond Africa if the Ebola outbreak is not contained.

Supports the governments of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo for their efforts to combat the Ebola virus.

Urges citizens of affected countries to respect preventative guidelines.

Supports the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of State, the Forest Service, and other U.S. government agencies providing technical, logistical, and material support.

Encourages deepened U.S. and international commitments to the global Ebola response.

Welcomes the delivery of assistance and increased engagement from donors such as the Economic Community of West African States, the African Union (AU), the World Bank, the European Union (EU), and Canada.

Supports the World Health Organization's Ebola Response Roadmap.

Encourages Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone to work together and with other nations and regional and subregional organizations to establish emergency response systems.

Recognizes the work of thousands of African, U.S., and international officials and volunteers on the ground in West Africa, and particularly health care workers.</summary>
