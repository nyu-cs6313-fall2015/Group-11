			 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on
			 February 11, 1986;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, for approximately 100 days between April 7, 1994, and July 1994, more than 800,000
			 civilians were killed in a genocide in Rwanda that targeted members of the
			 Tutsi, moderate Hutu, and Twa populations, resulting in the horrific
			 deaths of nearly 70 percent of the Tutsi population living in Rwanda;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas the massacres of innocent Rwandan civilians were premeditated and systematic attempts to
			 eliminate the Tutsi population by Hutu extremists, fueled by hatred and
			 incitement propagated by newspapers and radio;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas in addition to systematic targeting of an ethnic minority in Rwanda resulting in the mass
			 slaughter of innocent civilians, rape was also used as a weapon of war;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, despite the deployment of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in
			 October 1993 following the end of the Rwandan Civil War, its mandate was
			 insufficient to ensure the protection of large swathes of the population,
			 demonstrating the inability of the United Nations to effectively respond
			 to the unfolding genocide and stop or mitigate its impact;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, on July 4, 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a trained military group consisting of
			 formerly exiled Tutsis, began its takeover of the country, which resulted
			 in an ending of the genocide, though not a complete end to the violence,
			 including retribution;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, in October 1994, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established as

			 including genocide and crimes against humanity as well as the first
			 convictions for rape as a weapon of war;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas the United States Government supports initiatives to ensure that victims of genocide and

			 Representatives adopted House Concurrent Resolution 467, declaring that
			 “the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are
			 genocide”, and calling on the United States Government and the 
			 international community to take measures to address the situation
			 immediately;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, in September 2004, the United States Government, in testimony by Secretary of
			 State	Colin Powell before the Committee on Foreign Relations
			 of the Senate, declared the
			 ongoing conflict in Darfur, Sudan, a “genocide” perpetrated by the
			 government based in Khartoum against its own people and affecting over
			 2,400,000 people in Sudan, including an estimated 200,000 fatalities;</text></whereas><whereas><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, in September 2005, the United States joined other members of the United Nations in
			 adopting United Nations General Assembly Resolution 60/1, which affirmed

			 mitigate such acts;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, in April 2012, President Barack Obama established the Atrocities Prevention Board within
			 the United

			 genocide, as a core national security interest and core moral
			 responsibility;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, in July 2013, the National Intelligence Council completed the first ever National
			 Intelligence Estimate on the global risk for mass atrocities and genocide;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, in January 2014, the National Director of Intelligence testified before the Select
			 Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, stating that “the overall risk of
			 mass
			 atrocities worldwide will probably increase in 2014 and beyond. … Much of
			 the
			 world will almost certainly turn to the United States for leadership to
			 prevent and respond to mass atrocities.”;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas, despite measures taken by the United States Government and other governments since 1994,
			 the international
			 community still faces the challenges of responding to escalation of
			 violence, atrocities, and religious-based conflict in many corners of the
			 globe, including Syria and the Central African Republic, and a failure of
			 the international community to appropriately respond to and address the
			 rapidly deteriorating situation could result in further atrocities;</text></whereas><whereas commented="no"><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whereas the United Nations Security Council was unable to pass a resolution condemning the
