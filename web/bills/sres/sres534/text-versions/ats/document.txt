                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             July 31, 2014

     Mr. Kirk (for himself and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating September 6, 2014, as ``Everett McKinley Dirksen and 
                            Marigold Day''.

Whereas the great Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen of Pekin, Illinois, has 
        passed from the halls of the United States Capitol;
Whereas the current Senators wish to honor Senator Dirksen;
Whereas, upon the passing of Senator Dirksen, his contemporaries and peers 
        stated that--

    (1) Senator Dirksen--

    G    (A) provided sage advice and counsel and wholehearted wisdom;

    G    (B) provided support that made the civil rights legislation of the 
1960s a fact rather than a dream during that decade; and

    G    (C) was known as an American who cultivated a high sense of honor; 
and

    (2) when Senator Dirksen spoke, the country listened, and his eloquence 
was a source of national strength;

Whereas, as the obituary for Senator Dirksen in the New York Times noted, 
        Senator Dirksen ``was ever constant to the marigold, which he sought to 
        make the national flower and which he grew profusely in his garden'';
Whereas, as Senator Dirksen said on the Senate floor on April 17, 1967, the 
        marigold ``is a native of North America and can in truth and in fact be 
        called an American flower'';
Whereas, as Senator Dirksen said in that speech, the marigold ``is national in 
        character, for it grows and thrives in every one of the fifty states of 
        this nation'';
Whereas, as Senator Dirksen said in that speech, the marigold's ``robustness 
        reflects the hardihood and character of the generations who pioneered 
        and built this land into a great nation'';
Whereas, beginning in 1973, Pekin has held the Pekin Marigold Festival each year 
        to honor Pekin's favorite son, Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen; and
Whereas the 40th Pekin Marigold Festival will be held during the first week of 
        September 2014, which includes Saturday, September 6: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates September 6, 2014, as 
``Everett McKinley Dirksen and Marigold Day''.
