                               RESOLUTION


 
  Honoring former Senator and Rear Admiral Jeremiah Andrew Denton, Jr.

Whereas Jeremiah Andrew Denton, Jr. (referred to in this preamble as ``Senator 
        Denton'') was born in Mobile, Alabama, on July 15, 1924, and graduated 
        from the United States Naval Academy in 1946;
Whereas Senator Denton married Kathryn Jane Maury in 1946 and had 7 children 
        with her before she passed away in 2007;
Whereas Senator Denton is survived by his second wife, Mary Belle Bordone, and 
        his children, Jeremiah A. Denton III, William C. Denton, Donald A. 
        Denton, James S. Denton, Michael C. Denton, Madeleine D. Doak, and Mary 
        D. Lewis;
Whereas Senator Denton had a distinguished military career as a Naval Aviator--

    (1) receiving credit in 1957 as the architect of the ``Haystack 
Concept'', which revolutionized the way in which the Navy deployed ships to 
ensure that a single Russian nuclear attack could not destroy an entire 
fleet;

    (2) serving in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War;

    (3) providing significant support during the Cuban Missile Crisis as 
the Commander of the Guantanamo Defense Force;

    (4) receiving awards that include the Navy Cross, the Defense 
Distinguished Service Medal, the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, 3 Silver 
Stars, the Distinguished Flying Cross, 5 Bronze Stars, 2 Air Medals, 2 
Purple Hearts, and numerous combat theater and campaign awards;

    (5) retiring in 1977 at the rank of Rear Admiral after serving as 
Commandant of the Armed Forces Staff College; and

    (6) being inducted into the Alabama Military Hall of Honor in 2003;

Whereas Senator Denton was shot down on July 18, 1965, while leading a squadron 
        of 28 A-6 Intruders on his twelfth mission over North Vietnam and spent 
        the next 7 years and 7 months as a prisoner of war in North Vietnamese 
        prison camps, including the ``Hanoi Hilton'', where he suffered torture, 
        beatings, and starvation, and spent 4 years in solitary confinement 
        until his release in 1973;
Whereas despite extreme hardship, Senator Denton was revered by his fellow 
        prisoners and maintained a chain of command that lasted throughout his 
        imprisonment and helped prisoners of war stick together in resistance 
        against abuse from their captors;
Whereas in a televised propaganda interview released by the North Vietnamese in 
        1966, Senator Denton became a national hero when he answered the 
        questions of his interviewer and simultaneously blinked the letters ``T-
        O-R-T-U-R-E'' in Morse code, confirming to the world the harsh and 
        inhumane treatment of United States prisoners of war by the North 
        Vietnamese;
Whereas after returning to the United States, Senator Denton had a successful 
        legislative career, becoming in 1980 the first Republican elected to the 
        Senate from Alabama since the Reconstruction Era, maintaining a strong 
        conservative record, and working tirelessly with President Ronald Reagan 
        to combat the rise of Communism in Latin America;
Whereas Senator Denton was particularly proud of the ``Denton Program'', 
        authorizing the United States military to carry humanitarian aid on a 
        space-available basis to countries in need at no cost to the donor and 
        providing humanitarian aid for almost 30 years;
Whereas in 2007, the National Archives designated Senator Denton as 1 of the 25 
        most influential men in United States history; and
Whereas the life of service of Senator Denton should serve as an example to all 
        people of the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the Senate--
                    (A) has heard with profound sorrow and deep regret 
                the announcement of the death of the Honorable Jeremiah 
                Andrew Denton, Jr., former member of the Senate;
                    (B) honors the legacy and service of the former 
                Senator and retired Rear Admiral, Jeremiah Andrew 
                Denton Jr. (referred to in this resolution as ``Senator 
                Denton''), for his life of loyalty, duty, integrity, 
                and moral sincerity;
                    (C) extends its deepest condolences and sympathy to 
                the family and friends of Senator Denton who have lost 
                an inspiring leader and confidant;
                    (D) honors the dauntless valor of Senator Denton, 
                beloved son of Alabama, for his dedication and life of 
                selfless service to the people of the United States;
                    (E) recognizes that Senator Denton was a champion 
                for humanitarian aid and international assistance 
                programs through his legislative work and initiatives;
                    (F) reiterates the resolute character of Senator 
                Denton as a paragon of bravery who lived a life of 
                honor guided by his values and commitment to the 
                defense of the United States;
                    (G) expresses admiration and profound respect for 
                the legacy of Senator Denton as a truly courageous and 
                inspirational leader; and
                    (H) directs the Secretary of the Senate to 
                communicate this resolution to the House of 
                Representatives and transmit an enrolled copy thereof 
                to the family of the deceased; and
            (2) when the Senate adjourns today, it will stand adjourned 
        as a further mark of respect for the memory of the Honorable 
        Jeremiah Andrew Denton, Jr.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
