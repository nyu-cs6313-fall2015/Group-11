  condemning the terrorist acts of the Islamic State of Iraq and the

        Special Emergency Response and Assistance;
Whereas Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig represented the best qualities of humanity 
        through his work administering medical aid, food and shelter to the 
        people most impacted by the war in Syria;
Whereas Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig served with honor as a United States Army 
        Ranger;
Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (referred to in this preamble 
        as ``ISIL'') is a terrorist organization that has committed widespread 
        acts of violence against innocent civilians throughout Iraq and Syria, 
        forcing many people to flee their homeland;
Whereas ISIL has carried out grave atrocities targeting Muslims and religious 
        and ethnic minorities in the region, including women and children, for 
        enslavement, torture, and massacre;
Whereas ISIL has captured and assassinated journalists and humanitarian and 
        health workers, deepening the suffering of a war-torn region;
Whereas ISIL is responsible for the murder of United States citizens; and
Whereas ISIL continues to hold hostages in contravention of international law: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved,
