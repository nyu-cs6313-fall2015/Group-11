                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing and honoring the 150th anniversary of the establishment of 
                        the Yosemite Grant Act.

Whereas Yosemite National Park is internationally renowned as one of the most 
        extraordinary examples of natural beauty, splendor, and majesty, and is 
        a showcase of spectacular waterfalls, fantastic geologic history, and 
        abundant wildlife that has provided sanctuary, comfort, and inspiration 
        to humans for thousands of years;
Whereas, on June 30, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Act entitled 
        ``An Act authorizing a Grant to the State of California of the `Yo-
        Semite Valley' and of the Land embracing the `Mariposa Big Tree 
        Grove''', approved June 30, 1864 (commonly known as the Yosemite Grant) 
        which--

    (1) for one of the first times in United States history set aside land 
for enjoyment and protection for future generations; and

    (2) demonstrated--during some of the bloodiest days of the Civil War--
the unique vision of the United States to protect what would become one of 
the most cherished and iconic national parks;

Whereas with President Lincoln's action, this vision was codified and marked 
        Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove as the seed of the conservation 
        movement in what is now known as ``America's Best Idea'';
Whereas June 30, 1864, marks the birth of the national park idea, the concept 
        that has inspired over 400 National Park units in the United States and 
        hundreds of national parks worldwide;
Whereas the land surrounding Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove was designated 
        the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> national park on October 1, 1890, and Yosemite Valley 
        and Mariposa Grove were added to Yosemite National Park in 1906;
Whereas the land preserved within Yosemite National Park is part of the 
        ancestral homeland of several American Indian tribes and groups;
Whereas Yosemite National Park was dedicated a World Heritage Site in 1984 and 
        has fostered sister park relationships with national parks in foreign 
        countries including--

    (1) Huangshan National Park and Jiuzhaigou National Park in China; and

    (2) Torres del Paine National Park in Chile;

Whereas Yosemite National Park, a leader within the National Park Service, is--

    (1) the first national park to open a museum;

    (2) the first national park to hire a female law enforcement ranger;

    (3) the birthplace of rustic style architecture and of big wall rock 
climbing;

    (4) the first national park to formally implement park education and 
interpretation programs; and

    (5) the first national park to partner with a nonprofit stewardship 
organization;

Whereas Yosemite National Park receives over 4,000,000 visitors each year from 
        around the world;
Whereas Yosemite National Park is home to a variety of natural resource 
        features, containing--

    (1) wilderness areas encompassing 94 percent of the park's acreage;

    (2) more than 800 miles of trails including the renowned Pacific Crest 
Trail and John Muir Trail;

    (3) 2 federally designated wild and scenic rivers, the Tuolumne River 
and the Merced River;

    (4) the largest intact subalpine meadow complex in the Sierra Nevada; 
and

    (5) 30 properties and districts listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places and 5 National Historic Landmarks;

Whereas Yosemite National Park continues to embody amazing opportunities for 
        recreation and public enjoyment in one of the most amazing natural 
        physical landscapes in the world; and
Whereas the preservation of Yosemite National Park is a testament to the 
        commitment and determination of many dedicated people and institutions 
        over the past 150 years: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes and honors the 150<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary 
        of the establishment of the Act entitled ``An Act authorizing a 
        Grant to the State of California of the `Yo-Semite Valley' and 
        of the Land embracing the `Mariposa Big Tree Grove''', approved 
        June 30, 1864 (commonly known as the Yosemite Grant) (referred 
        to in this resolving clause as the ``Yosemite Grant Act'') on 
        June 30, 2014; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        and honor the 150<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the establishment 
        of the Yosemite Grant Act.
                                 <all>
