                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the Alaska Aces hockey team on winning the 2014 Kelly 
           Cup as champions of the East Coast Hockey League.

Whereas on June 9, 2014, the Alaska Aces hockey team claimed the championship of 
        the East Coast Hockey League with a 4-0 series-clinching win over the 
        Cincinnati Cyclones, which resulted in the Alaska Aces winning the East 
        Coast Hockey League's Kelly Cup trophy;
Whereas the June 9 victory gave the Alaska Aces a 4-2 series win in the 
        championship round and resulted in a 16-5 win-loss record for the Alaska 
        Aces in the 2014 playoffs;
Whereas the 2014 East Coast Hockey League championship is the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> 
        championship for the Alaska Aces in the past 9 years, making the Alaska 
        Aces only the 2<SUP>nd </SUP>East Coast Hockey League team to win more 
        than 2 East Coast Hockey League championships;
Whereas in 2014, the Alaska Aces set an East Coast Hockey League record by 
        winning the team's 4<SUP>th</SUP> straight Brabham Cup, which honors the 
        East Coast Hockey League's best regular-season record and guarantees 
        home-ice advantage throughout the entire postseason;
Whereas the East Coast Hockey League is a premier ``AA'' hockey league featuring 
        22 teams from around the country playing a 72-game regular season 
        schedule;
Whereas the Alaska Aces are affiliated with the Calgary Flames of the National 
        Hockey League, opening a pathway to allow promising players to advance 
        to the top tier of professional hockey in the United States and Canada; 
        and
Whereas the people of the State of Alaska are proud of the dedication, hard 
        work, and gritty determination of the players, coaches, and management 
        of the Alaska Aces: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Alaska Aces hockey team for winning 
        the 2014 Kelly Cup as champions of the East Coast Hockey 
        League;
            (2) recognizes the players, coaches, students, staff, and 
        fans whose dedication helped the Alaska Aces win the East Coast 
        Hockey League championship; and
            (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--
                    (A) the managing owner of the Alaska Aces, to be 
                shared with the other team owners;
                    (B) the head coach of the Alaska Aces; and
                    (C) the assistant coach of the Alaska Aces.
                                 <all>
