                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              May 15, 2013

 Mr. Graham (for himself, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Begich, Ms. 
   Heitkamp, Ms. Murkowski, and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
      Designating May 15, 2013, as ``National MPS Awareness Day''.

Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this resolution as ``MPS'') are a 
        group of genetically determined lysosomal storage diseases that render 
        the human body incapable of producing certain enzymes needed to break 
        down complex carbohydrates;
Whereas MPS diseases cause complex carbohydrates to be stored in almost every 
        cell in the body and progressively cause cellular damage;
Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS--

    (1) adversely affects the human body by damaging the heart, respiratory 
system, bones, internal organs, and central nervous system; and

    (2) often results in intellectual disabilities, short stature, corneal 
damage, joint stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and hearing impairment, 
heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic respiratory problems, and, most 
importantly, a drastically shortened life span;

Whereas symptoms of MPS are usually not apparent at birth;
Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an individual afflicted with 
        MPS begins to decrease at a very early stage in the life of the 
        individual;
Whereas research has resulted in the development of limited treatments for some 
        MPS diseases;
Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments for additional MPS 
        diseases are underway as of the date of agreement to this resolution;
Whereas, despite the creation of new remedies, the blood-brain barrier continues 
        to be a significant impediment to effectively treating the brain, which 
        prevents the treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;
Whereas the quality of life of the individuals afflicted with MPS, and the 
        treatments available to those individuals, will be enhanced through the 
        development of early detection techniques and early intervention;
Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are limited by a lack of 
        awareness about MPS diseases;
Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS diseases extends to individuals within 
        the medical community;
Whereas the cellular damage that is caused by MPS makes MPS a model for the 
        study of many other degenerative genetic diseases; and
Whereas the development of effective therapies and a potential cure for MPS 
        diseases can be accomplished by increased awareness, research, data 
        collection, and information distribution: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates May 15, 2013, as ``National MPS Awareness 
        Day''; and
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS 
        Awareness Day''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
