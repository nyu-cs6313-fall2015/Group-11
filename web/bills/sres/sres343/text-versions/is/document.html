                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            February 4, 2014

 Mr. McCain submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
               the Committee on Rules and Administration

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Establishing a Select Committee of the Senate to make a full and 
 thorough investigation of the unauthorized disclosures of apparently 
    classified information concerning the National Security Agency 
intelligence-collection programs, operations, and activities, including 
     programs affecting Americans, to make findings based upon the 
 investigation, and to make recommendations based on the investigation 
                             and findings.

Whereas since June 2013, publications have revealed details about certain 
        National Security Agency intelligence-collection programs, operations, 
        and activities, including intelligence-collection programs affecting 
        Americans;
Whereas such publications appear to be based in substantial part on unauthorized 
        disclosures of classified information concerning intelligence 
        collection;
Whereas the unauthorized disclosure of classified information is a felony under 
        Federal law;
Whereas the National Security Agency relies on Federal agency contractors to 
        carry out important aspects of its national security mission;
Whereas the extent of reliance on contract positions may unwisely increase the 
        number of individuals with potential access to classified information 
        and may increase the risk of unauthorized disclosures;
Whereas such unauthorized disclosures may cause damage to United States national 
        security interests, intelligence sources and methods, and relationships 
        with key allies;
Whereas senior officials in the intelligence community may have misled Congress 
        or otherwise obfuscated the nature, extent, or use of certain 
        intelligence-collection programs, operations, and activities of the 
        National Security Agency, including intelligence-collection programs 
        affecting Americans;
Whereas the provision of incomplete or inaccurate information by officials of 
        the intelligence community has inhibited effective congressional 
        oversight of certain intelligence-collection programs, operations, and 
        activities of the National Security Agency, including intelligence-
        collection programs affecting Americans, and undermined congressional 
        and public support of these programs;
Whereas intelligence-collection programs, operations, and activities of the 
        National Security Agency have been valuable to combating terrorism and 
        ensuring the security of the homeland;
Whereas some such programs, operations, and activities that are the subject 
        matter of the unauthorized disclosures may not have been authorized, or 
        may have exceeded that which was authorized, by law, or may not have 
        been permitted under the Constitution of the United States; and
Whereas a Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies was 
        established by the President and issued a final report entitled 
        ``Liberty and Security in a Changing World'' on December 12, 2013: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved,

SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATION.

                the national security mission of the Agency;

                are the subject matter of those disclosures;
                    (C) the extent to which such programs, operations, 
                and activities that were the subject matter of such 
                unauthorized disclosures may have gone beyond what was 
                authorized by law or permitted under the Constitution 
                of the United States;
                    (D) the extent and sufficiency of oversight of such

                findings and recommendations; and
                    (B) the legislative action that would be required 
                to implement those findings and recommendations.
            (7) The need for specific legislative authority to govern
