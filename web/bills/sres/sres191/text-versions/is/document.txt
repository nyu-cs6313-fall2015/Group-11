                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating July 27, 2013, as ``National Day of the American Cowboy''.

Whereas pioneering men and women, recognized as ``cowboys'', helped establish 
        the American West;
Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, integrity, courage, compassion, respect, a 
        strong work ethic, and patriotism;
Whereas the cowboy spirit exemplifies strength of character, sound family 
        values, and good common sense;
Whereas the cowboy archetype transcends ethnicity, gender, geographic 
        boundaries, and political affiliations;
Whereas the cowboy is an excellent steward of the land and its creatures, who 
        lives off the land and works to protect and enhance the environment;
Whereas cowboy traditions have been a part of American culture for generations;
Whereas the cowboy continues to be an important part of the economy through the 
        work of many thousands of ranchers across the United States who 
        contribute to the economic well-being of every State;
Whereas millions of fans watch professional and working ranch rodeo events 
        annually, making rodeo one of the most-watched sports in the United 
        States;
Whereas membership and participation in rodeo and other organizations that 
        promote and encompass the livelihood of cowboys span every generation 
        and transcend race and gender;
Whereas the cowboy is a central figure in literature, film, and music and 
        occupies a central place in the public imagination;
Whereas the cowboy is an American icon; and
Whereas the ongoing contributions made by cowboys and cowgirls to their 
        communities should be recognized and encouraged: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates July 27, 2013, as ``National Day of the 
        American Cowboy''; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
