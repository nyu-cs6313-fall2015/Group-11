To designate the year 2013 as the ``International Year of Statistics''.

Whereas more than 2,000 organizations worldwide have recognized 2013 as the 
        International Year of Statistics, a global celebration and recognition 
        of the contributions of statistical science to the well-being of 
        humankind;
Whereas the science of statistics is vital to the improvement of human life 
        because of the power of statistics to improve, enlighten, and 
        understand;
Whereas statistics is the science of collecting, analyzing, and understanding 
        data that permeates and bolsters all sciences;
Whereas statisticians contribute to the vitality and excellence of myriad 
        aspects of United States society, including the economy, health care, 
        security, commerce, education, and research;
Whereas rapidly increasing numbers of students in grades K through 16 and 
        educators are recognizing the many benefits of statistical literacy as a 
        collection of skills to intelligently cope with the requirements of 
        citizenship, employment, and family;
Whereas statisticians contribute to smart and efficient government through the 
        production of statistical data that informs on all aspects of our 
        society, including population, labor, education, economy, 
        transportation, health, energy, and crime;
Whereas the goals of the International Year of Statistics are to increase public 
        awareness of the power and impact of statistics on all aspects of 
        society, nurture statistics as a profession, especially among young 
        people, and promote creativity and development in the sciences of 
        probability and statistics; and
Whereas throughout the year, organizations in countries across the world will 
        reach out to adults and children through symposia, conferences, 
        demonstrations, workshops, contests, school activities, exhibitions, and 
        other public events to increase awareness of the history and importance 
        of statistics: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the year 2013 as the ``International Year of 
        Statistics'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of the International Year 
        of Statistics;
            (3) recognizes the necessity of educating the public on the 
        merits of the sciences, including statistics, and promoting 
        interest in the sciences among the youth of the United States; 
        and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to 
        participate in the International Year of Statistics through 
        participation in appropriate programs, activities, and 
        ceremonies that call attention to the importance of statistics 
        to the present and future well-being of the people of the 
        United States.
