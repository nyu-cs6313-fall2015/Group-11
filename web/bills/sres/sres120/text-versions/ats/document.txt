                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             April 25, 2013

Mr. Leahy (for Mr. Wicker (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. 
Grassley)) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and 
                               agreed to

                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the mission and goals of 2013 National Crime Victims' Rights 
 Week to increase public awareness of the rights, needs, and concerns 
of, and services available to assist, victims and survivors of crime in 
                           the United States.

Whereas, in 2011, there were nearly 6,000,000 victims of violent crime and more 
        than 17,000,000 victims of property crime in the United States;
Whereas, according to National Crime Victimization Survey, non-fatal violent 
        crime increased by 17 percent and property crime increased by 11 percent 
        in the United States between 2010 and 2011;
Whereas, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Uniform Crime 
        Reporting, ``law enforcement agencies throughout the nation reported an 
        increase of 1.9 percent in the number of violent crimes brought to their 
        attention for the first 6 months of 2012 when compared with figures 
        reported for the same time in 2011'';
Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on individuals, 
        families, schools, and communities by protecting the rights of crime 
        victims and ensuring that resources, and services are available to help 
        rebuild lives;
Whereas, despite impressive accomplishments during the last 40 years in 
        increasing the rights of, and services available to, crime victims and 
        survivors, many challenges remain to ensure that all victims are--

    (1) treated with dignity, fairness, and respect;

    (2) offered support and services regardless of whether victims report 
crimes committed against them; and

    (3) recognized as key participants within the criminal, juvenile, 
Federal, tribal, and civil justice systems in the United States when 
victims do report crimes;

Whereas victims and survivors of crime in the United States need and deserve 
        support and assistance to help them cope with the often devastating 
        consequences of crime;
Whereas, during each of the last 31 years, communities across the United States 
        have joined Congress and the Department of Justice in commemorating 
        National Crime Victims' Rights Week to celebrate a shared vision of a 
        comprehensive and collaborative response that identifies and addresses 
        the many needs of crime victims and survivors;
Whereas Congress and the President agree on the need for a renewed commitment to 
        serving all victims of crime in the 21st century;
Whereas the theme of 2013 National Crime Victims' Rights Week, celebrated from 
        April 21 through April 27, 2013, is ``New Challenges, New Solutions'', 
        which highlights the many challenges that confront the fields of crime 
        victim assistance, justice, and public safety; and
Whereas the people of the United States recognize and appreciate the continued 
        importance of promoting the rights of, and services for, crime victims, 
        and of honoring crime victims, survivors, and those who provide services 
        for them: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the mission and goals of 2013 National Crime 
        Victims' Rights Week to increase individual and public 
        awareness of--
                    (A) the impact of crime on victims and survivors; 
                and
                    (B) the challenges to achieving justice for 
                victims, and the many solutions that can meet these 
                challenges; and
            (2) recognizes that dignity, fairness, and respect 
        constitute the very foundation of how crime victims and 
        survivors should be treated.
                                 <all>
