         Honoring Gonzaga University on its 125th anniversary.

Whereas, in 1881, at the request of the citizens of the City of Spokane Falls,

        Mountain Mission, committed to establishing a school along the banks of 
        the Spokane River;
Whereas, on September 17, 1887, Gonzaga College officially opened its doors with 
        an inaugural class of 18 students;
Whereas Gonzaga College, known today as Gonzaga University, has grown into a 
        nationally recognized 4-year liberal arts university, where nearly 8,000 
        students can choose from more than 75 fields of study, select from 25 
        master's degree programs, and pursue doctoral degrees in law and 
        leadership studies;
Whereas Gonzaga University is repeatedly listed as one of the best comprehensive 
        regional universities in the western United States, is ranked second in 
        the United States among small universities for alumni serving in the 
        Peace Corps, and consistently earns a place on the President's Higher 
        Education and Community Service Honor Roll;
Whereas Gonzaga University invests more than $60,000,000 annually in 
        scholarships and in financial assistance to its students; and
Whereas notable Gonzaga alumni include a former Speaker of the United States 
        House of Representatives, a Governor of the State of Washington and the 
        first female Attorney General of the State of Washington, the current 
        Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives, judges of the 
        United States district courts, and members of the Washington State
