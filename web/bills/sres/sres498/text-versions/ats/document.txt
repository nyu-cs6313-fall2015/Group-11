                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding United States support for 
  the State of Israel as it defends itself against unprovoked rocket 
             attacks from the Hamas terrorist organization.

Whereas Hamas is a United States-designated terrorist organization whose charter 
        calls for the destruction of the State of Israel;
Whereas Hamas continues to reject the core principles of the Middle East Quartet 
        (the United Nations, the United States, the European Union, and 
        Russia)--recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce violence, and 
        accept previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements;
Whereas Hamas has killed hundreds of Israelis and dozens of Americans in rocket 
        attacks and suicide bombings;
Whereas, since Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, Hamas and other terrorist 
        groups have fired thousands of rockets at Israel;
Whereas Hamas has entered into a unity governing arrangement with Fatah and the 
        Palestinian Authority;
Whereas the unity governing agreement implies Fatah's and the Palestinian 
        Authority's support for Hamas' belligerent actions against Israel, 
        potentially contributing to a false perception of legitimacy for Hamas' 
        belligerent actions;
Whereas, since June 2014, Hamas has fired nearly 300 rockets at Israel;
Whereas Hamas' weapons arsenal includes approximately 12,000 rockets that vary 
        in range;
Whereas innocent Israeli civilians are indiscriminately targeted by Hamas rocket 
        attacks; and
Whereas 5,000,000 Israelis are currently living under the threat of rocket 
        attacks from Gaza: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) reaffirms its support for Israel's right to defend its 
        citizens and ensure the survival of the State of Israel;
            (2) condemns the unprovoked rocket fire at Israel;
            (3) calls on Hamas to immediately cease all rocket and 
        other attacks against Israel; and
            (4) calls on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas 
        to dissolve the unity governing arrangement with Hamas and 
        condemn the attacks on Israel.
                                 <all>
