                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating the week beginning October 19, 2014, as ``National 
                        Character Counts Week''.

Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that the young people of 
        the United States become an involved, caring citizenry of good 
        character;
Whereas the character education of children has become more urgent, as violence 
        by and against youth increasingly threatens the physical and 
        psychological well-being of the people of the United States;
Whereas, more than ever, children need strong and constructive guidance from 
        their families and their communities, including schools, youth 
        organizations, religious institutions, and civic groups;
Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the character of its 
        individual citizens;
Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are taught the importance 
        of good character and the positive effects that good character can have 
        in personal relationships, in school, and in the workplace;
Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not automatically develop 
        good character and that, therefore, conscientious efforts must be made 
        by institutions and individuals that influence youth to help young 
        people develop the essential traits and characteristics that comprise 
        good character;
Whereas, although character development is, first and foremost, an obligation of 
        families, the efforts of faith communities, schools, and youth, civic, 
        and human service organizations also play an important role in fostering 
        and promoting good character;
Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, youth, and community 
        leaders to recognize the importance of character education in preparing 
        young people to play a role in determining the future of the United 
        States;
Whereas effective character education is based on core ethical values, which 
        form the foundation of a democratic society;
Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, 
        fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;
Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, religious, and socioeconomic 
        differences;
Whereas the character and conduct of youth reflect the character and conduct of 
        society, and, therefore, every adult has the responsibility to teach and 
        model ethical values and every social institution has the responsibility 
        to promote the development of good character;
Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, especially those that 
        have an interest in the education and training of the young people of 
        the United States, to adopt the elements of character as intrinsic to 
        the well-being of individuals, communities, and society;
Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the need, and have taken 
        steps, to integrate the values of their communities into teaching 
        activities; and
Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts Week'', during which 
        individuals, families, schools, youth organizations, religious 
        institutions, civic groups, and other organizations focus on character 
        education, is of great benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week beginning October 19, 2014, as 
        ``National Character Counts Week''; and
            (2) calls upon the people of the United States and 
        interested groups--
                    (A) to embrace the elements of character identified 
                by local schools and communities, such as 
                trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, 
                caring, and citizenship; and
                    (B) to observe the week with appropriate 
                ceremonies, programs, and activities.
                                 <all>
