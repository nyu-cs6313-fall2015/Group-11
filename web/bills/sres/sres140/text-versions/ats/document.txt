                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating and acknowledging the dedication and sacrifices made by 
 the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who have been 
                 killed or injured in the line of duty.

Whereas the well-being of all people in the United States is preserved and 
        enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance and dedication of law 
        enforcement officers;
Whereas more than 900,000 men and women, at great risk to their personal safety, 
        serve the people of the United States as guardians of the peace;
Whereas peace officers are on the front lines in protecting the schools and 
        schoolchildren of the United States;
Whereas, in 2012, 120 peace officers across the United States were killed in the 
        line of duty;
Whereas Congress should strongly support initiatives to reduce violent crime and 
        to increase the factors that contribute to the safety of law enforcement 
        officers;
Whereas more than 19,000 Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers 
        whose names are engraved upon the National Law Enforcement Officers 
        Memorial in Washington, District of Columbia, lost their lives in the 
        line of duty while protecting the people of the United States;
Whereas, in 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15 as ``National 
        Peace Officers Memorial Day''; and
Whereas, on May 15, 2013, more than 20,000 peace officers are expected to gather 
        in Washington, District of Columbia, to join the families of their 
        recently-fallen comrades to honor those comrades and all others who went 
        before them: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates and acknowledges the dedication and 
        sacrifices made by the Federal, State, and local law 
        enforcement officers who have been killed or injured in the 
        line of duty;
            (2) recognizes May 15, 2013, as ``National Peace Officers 
        Memorial Day''; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        National Peace Officers Memorial Day with appropriate ceremony, 
        solemnity, appreciation, and respect.
                                 <all>
