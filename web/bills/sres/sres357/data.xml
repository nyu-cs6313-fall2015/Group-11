  <summary>2/12/2014--Introduced.
Expresses the sense of the Senate that: (1) the President should increase democracy and human rights programming in Ukraine; (2) the United States should review security assistance funding for any organization in Ukraine that violates the civil or human rights of the people of Ukraine; (3) the Department of State should consider imposing targeted sanctions against the perpetrators of state-sanctioned violence in Ukraine; (4) the United States should urge authorities in Ukraine to locate missing persons and release all political prisoners, including former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, and hold perpetrators of extra-legal measures accountable; and (5) the United States endorses the European Union's Council on Foreign Affairs' statement that a new and inclusive government, constitutional reform, and preparations for free presidential elections would contribute to bringing Ukraine back on a sustainable reform path.</summary>
