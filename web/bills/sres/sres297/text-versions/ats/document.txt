 Congratulating the Minnesota Lynx women's basketball team on winning 
     the 2013 Women's National Basketball Association Championship.

Whereas on October 10, 2013, the Minnesota Lynx won the 2013 Women's National 
        Basketball Association (WNBA) Championship;
Whereas this is the second WNBA Championship for the Minnesota Lynx in 3 years;
Whereas the Minnesota Lynx won every game in the 2013 WNBA playoffs, beating the 
        Seattle Storm in the Western Conference semifinals, the Phoenix Mercury 
        in the Conference finals, and decisively beating the Atlanta Dream in 
        the Championship round;
Whereas, on average, more than 13,000 fans attended each home game during the 
        Championship round at the Target Center in Minneapolis to cheer on the 
        Minnesota Lynx;
Whereas the Minnesota Lynx feature 3 gold medal-winning Olympians, Maya Moore, 
        Seimone Augustus, and Lindsay Whalen, and a highly talented team of 
        professionals, including Rebekkah Brunson, Janel McCarville, and Monica 
        Wright; and
Whereas the Minnesota Lynx are one of only four WNBA teams to win multiple 
        titles, with both championships coming under the coaching guidance of 
        Cheryl Reeve: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the achievements of the players, coaches, 
        fans, and staff whose hard work and dedication helped the 
        Minnesota Lynx win the 2013 Women's National Basketball 
        Association Championship; and
            (2) recognizes the Twin Cities region and the State of 
        Minnesota, both of which enthusiastically support the team and 
        women's professional basketball.
                                 <all>
