                               RESOLUTION


 
      Designating May 18, 2013, as ``National Kids to Parks Day''.

Whereas the third annual National Kids to Parks Day will be celebrated on May 
        18, 2013;
Whereas the goal of National Kids to Parks Day is to empower young people and 
        encourage families to get outdoors and visit the parks of the United 
        States;
Whereas, on National Kids to Parks Day, individuals from rural and urban areas 
        of the United States can be reintroduced to the splendid National Parks 
        and State and neighborhood parks that are located in their communities;
Whereas communities across the United States offer a variety of natural 
        resources and public land, often with free access, to individuals 
        seeking outdoor recreation;
Whereas the people of the United States should encourage young people to lead a 
        more active lifestyle, as too many young people in the United States are 
        overweight or obese;
Whereas National Kids to Parks Day is an opportunity for families to take a 
        break from their busy lives and come together for a day of wholesome 
        fun; and
Whereas National Kids to Parks Day aims to broaden the appreciation of young 
        people for nature and the outdoors: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates May 18, 2013, as ``National Kids to Parks 
        Day'';
            (2) recognizes the importance of outdoor recreation and the 
        preservation of open spaces to the health of the young people 
        of the United States; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe the 
        day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
                                 <all>
