                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for the goals and ideals of National Infant 
                    Mortality Awareness Month, 2013.

Whereas the term ``infant mortality'' refers to the death of a baby before the 
        first birthday of the baby;
Whereas the United States ranks 50th among countries in the rate of infant 
        mortality;
Whereas high rates of infant mortality are especially prevalent in African 
        American, Native American, Alaskan Native, Latino, Asian, and Hawaiian 
        and other Pacific Islander communities, communities with high rates of 
        unemployment and poverty, and communities with limited access to safe 
        housing and medical providers;
Whereas premature birth and low birth weight are leading causes of infant 
        mortality;
Whereas, according to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 
        premature birth costs the United States more than $26,000,000,000 
        annually;
Whereas infant mortality can be substantially reduced through community-based 
        services, such as outreach, home visitation, care coordination, health 
        education, interconceptional care, and fatherhood involvement;
Whereas support for community-based programs to reduce infant mortality may 
        result in lower future spending on medical interventions, special 
        education, and other social services that may be needed for infants and 
        children who are born with a low birth weight;
Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services, acting through the Office 
        of Minority Health, has implemented the ``A Healthy Baby Begins With 
        You'' campaign;
Whereas the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and 
        Services Administration has provided national leadership on the issue of 
        infant mortality;
Whereas the Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality provides advice and 
        recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on 
        reducing infant mortality and improving the health status of infants and 
        pregnant women;
Whereas the Advisory Committee on Infant Mortality provides advice and 
        recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services with 
        respect to developing a national strategy for reducing infant mortality;
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on infant mortality are held 
        during the month of September each year; and
Whereas September 2013 has been designated as ``National Infant Mortality 
        Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports--
                    (A) the goals and ideals of National Infant 
                Mortality Awareness Month, 2013;
                    (B) efforts to educate people in the United States 
                about infant mortality and the factors that contribute 
                to infant mortality; and
                    (C) efforts to reduce infant deaths, low birth 
                weight, pre-term births, and disparities in perinatal 
                outcomes;
            (2) recognizes the critical importance of including efforts 
        to reduce infant mortality and the factors that contribute to 
        infant mortality as part of prevention and wellness strategies; 
        and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        National Infant Mortality Awareness Month with appropriate 
        programs and activities.
                                 <all>
