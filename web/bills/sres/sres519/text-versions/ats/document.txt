                               RESOLUTION


 
       Designating August 16, 2014, as ``National Airborne Day''.

Whereas the members of the airborne forces of the Armed Forces of the United 
        States have a long and honorable history as bold and fierce warriors 
        who, for the national security of the United States and the defense of 
        freedom and peace, project the ground combat power of the United States 
        by air transport to the far reaches of the battle area and to the far 
        corners of the world;
Whereas the experiment of the United States with airborne operations began on 
        June 25, 1940, when the Army Parachute Test Platoon was first authorized 
        by the Department of War, and 48 volunteers began training in July 1940;
Whereas August 16 marks the anniversary of the first official Army parachute 
        jump, which took place on August 16, 1940, to test the innovative 
        concept of inserting United States ground combat forces behind a battle 
        line by means of a parachute;
Whereas the success of the Army Parachute Test Platoon in the days immediately 
        before the entry of the United States into World War II validated the 
        airborne operational concept and led to the creation of a formidable 
        force of airborne formations that included the 11\th\, 13\th\, 17\th\, 
        82\nd\, and 101\st\ Airborne Divisions;
Whereas, included in those divisions, and among other separate formations, were 
        many airborne combat, combat support, and combat service support units 
        that served with distinction and achieved repeated success in armed 
        hostilities during World War II;
Whereas the achievements of the airborne units during World War II prompted the 
        evolution of those units into a diversified force of parachute and air-
        assault units that, over the years, have fought in Korea, Vietnam, 
        Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and have engaged 
        in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula, the 
        Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo;
Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the members of the 
        United States airborne forces, including members of the XVIII Airborne 
        Corps, the 82\nd\ Airborne Division, the 101\st\ Airborne Division, the 
        173\rd\ Airborne Brigade Combat Team, the 4\th\ Brigade Combat Team 
        (Airborne) of the 25\th\ Infantry Division, the 75\th\ Ranger Regiment, 
        special operations forces of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air 
        Force, and other units of the Armed Forces, have demonstrated bravery 
        and honor in combat, stability, and training operations in Afghanistan 
        and Iraq;
Whereas the modern-day airborne forces also include other elite forces composed 
        of airborne trained and qualified special operations warriors, including 
        Army Special Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance units, Navy SEALs, and 
        Air Force combat control and pararescue teams;
Whereas, of the members and former members of the United States airborne forces, 
        thousands have achieved the distinction of making combat jumps, dozens 
        have earned the Medal of Honor, and hundreds have earned the 
        Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star, or other decorations and 
        awards for displays of heroism, gallantry, intrepidity, and valor;
Whereas the members and former members of the United States airborne forces are 
        all members of a proud and honorable tradition that, together with the 
        special skills and achievements of those members, distinguishes the 
        members as intrepid combat parachutists, air assault forces, special 
        operation forces, and, in the past, glider troops;
Whereas individuals from every State of the United States have served gallantly 
        in the airborne forces, and each State is proud of the contributions of 
        its paratrooper veterans during the many conflicts faced by the United 
        States;
Whereas the history and achievements of the members and former members of the 
        United States airborne forces warrant special expressions of the 
        gratitude of the people of the United States; and
Whereas, since the airborne forces, past and present, celebrate August 16 as the 
        anniversary of the first official jump by the Army Parachute Test 
        Platoon, August 16 is an appropriate day to recognize as National 
        Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates August 16, 2014, as ``National Airborne 
        Day''; and
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        National Airborne Day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
        and activities.
                                 <all>
