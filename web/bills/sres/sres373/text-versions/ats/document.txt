                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the importance of biosecurity and agro-defense in the 
                             United States.

Whereas following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States 
        increased its efforts to combat the threat of global terrorism;
Whereas the September 11<SUP>th</SUP> attacks illustrated the vulnerability of 
        the food supply and agriculture economy of the United States;
Whereas in 2002, Congress created the Department of Homeland Security to improve 
        the Government's ability to respond to threats facing the United States;
Whereas the Department of Homeland Security, in partnership with the Department 
        of Agriculture, was quick to recognize the threat posed by 
        agroterrorism;
Whereas on January 30, 2004, President George W. Bush issued a Homeland Security 
        Presidential Directive entitled ``Defense of United States Agriculture 
        and Food'';
Whereas the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction 
        Proliferation and Terrorism stated in a 2008 report that bioterrorism 
        was a more likely threat to the United States than nuclear terrorism, 
        and higher priority should therefore be given to efforts to combat 
        bioterrorism;
Whereas the threat of a terrorist attack on the United States persists, and 
        continued vigilance is necessary; and
Whereas construction of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility began on May 
        28, 2013: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) as the United States combats terrorism in all forms and 
        around the world, the safety, security, and health of our 
        livestock and agriculture commodities must not be forgotten;
            (2) research and investment in biosecurity and agro-defense 
        should be supported by Congress;
            (3) providing the resources, both intellectually and 
        materially, for the advancement of vaccines and cures for 
        deadly pathogens and emerging zoonotic diseases is an integral 
        part of homeland defense;
            (4) without the tools necessary to protect the people, 
        agriculture economy, and food supply of the United States, this 
        Nation remains vulnerable to attack;
            (5) the world depends on the agriculture of the United 
        States;
            (6) the world depends on the leadership of the United 
        States in science and technology;
            (7) the United States must remain a leader in the fight 
        against bioterrorism; and
            (8) biosecurity and a strong agro-defense system are 
        achievable goals for the United States in the global war on 
        terrorism.
                                 <all>
