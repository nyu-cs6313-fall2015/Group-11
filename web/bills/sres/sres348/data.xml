  <summary>2/6/2014--Introduced.
Commends the U.S. representatives on their leadership on United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution (UNHRC) 22/1 which promotes reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka.

 Calls on the United States and the international community to establish an independent international accountability mechanism to evaluate reports of war crimes and other human rights violations committed by both sides during and after the war in Sri Lanka.

Urges the Government of Sri Lanka to: (1) allow access for media, international aid agencies, and human rights groups into all regions of the country and to detention sites; and (2) end its media restrictions.

Calls upon the President to develop a comprehensive policy towards Sri Lanka that reflects U.S. interests, including respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, economic interests, and security interests.</summary>
