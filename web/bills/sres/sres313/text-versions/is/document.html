supporting efforts to increase awareness of the value of locally owned 
                           small businesses.

Whereas small businesses are responsible for more than 50 percent of the 
        private, nonfarm product of the gross domestic product;
Whereas small businesses generated 64 percent of net new jobs created between 
        1993 and 2011;
Whereas 87 percent of consumers in the United States agree that the success of 
        small businesses is critical to the overall economic health of the 
        United States;
Whereas 93 percent of consumers in the United States agree that it is important 
        to support the small businesses in their community; and
Whereas November 30, 2013 would be an appropriate date to designate as ``Small 
        Business Saturday'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates November 30, 2013 as ``Small Business 
        Saturday''; and
            (2) supports efforts to--
                    (A) encourage consumers to shop locally; and
                    (B) increase awareness of the value of locally 
                owned small businesses and the impact of locally owned 
                small businesses on the economy of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
