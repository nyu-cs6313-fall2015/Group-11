                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 19, 2013

 Mr. Whitehouse (for himself and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following 
 resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, 
                          Labor, and Pensions

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for the designation of March 2013 as ``National 
                    Middle Level Education Month''.

Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals, the Association 
        for Middle Level Education, the National Forum to Accelerate Middle 
        Grades Reform, and the National Association of Elementary School 
        Principals have declared March 2013 to be ``National Middle Level 
        Education Month'';
Whereas schools that educate middle level students are responsible for educating 
        nearly 24,000,000 young adolescents between the ages of 10 and 15, in 
        grades 5 through 9, who are undergoing rapid and dramatic changes in 
        their physical, intellectual, social, emotional, and moral development;
Whereas those young adolescents deserve challenging and engaging instruction, 
        knowledgeable teachers and administrators who are prepared to provide 
        young adolescents with a safe, challenging, and supportive learning 
        environment, and organizational structures that banish anonymity and 
        promote personalization, collaboration, and social equity;
Whereas the habits and values established during early adolescence have a 
        lifelong influence that directly affects the future health and welfare 
        of the United States;
Whereas research indicates that the academic achievement of a student in eighth 
        grade has a larger impact on the readiness of that student for college 
        at the end of high school than any academic achievement of that student 
        in high school; and
Whereas, in order to improve graduation rates and prepare students to be 
        lifelong learners who are ready for college, a career, and civic 
        participation, it is necessary for the people of the United States to 
        have a deeper understanding of the distinctive mission of middle level 
        education: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors and recognizes the importance of middle level 
        education and the contributions of the individuals who educate 
        middle level students; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Middle Level Education Month by visiting and 
        celebrating schools that are responsible for educating young 
        adolescents in the United States.
                                 <all>
