Whereas, on September 16, 2013, a tragic mass shooting took place at the

Whereas the people of the United States mourn the loss of the 12 innocent

        Washington and is the workplace of 18,000 military, civilian, and 
        contractor personnel who serve the United States; and
Whereas military officials, law enforcement officers, and other first responders 
        reacted swiftly and courageously to prevent additional loss of life: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) offers its heartfelt condolences to the families, 
        friends, and loved ones of the innocent victims killed or

            (3) recognizes the difficult healing and recovery process 
        that lies ahead for communities affected by the mass shooting 
        at the Washington Navy Yard;
            (4) honors the courageous and professional service of --
                    (A) the uniformed men and women of the Navy and 
                other members of the United States Armed Forces;
                    (B) all civilian employees who provide support for 
                the United States Armed Forces; and

                responders, and medical professionals who responded to 
                and assisted victims of the mass shooting at the

            (5) thanks those individuals for their selfless and
