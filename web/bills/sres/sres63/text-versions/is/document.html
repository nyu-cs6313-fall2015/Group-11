                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           February 28, 2013

    Mr. Toomey (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following 
   resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Encouraging the Navy to commission the USS Somerset (LPD-25) in 
                      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Whereas the USS Somerset (LPD-25) is the ninth and newest amphibious transport 
        dock ship in the San Antonio class;
Whereas the USS Somerset honors the passengers of United Airlines Flight 93 
        whose actions prevented terrorist hijackers from reaching their intended 
        target, forcing the aircraft to crash in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, 
        on September 11, 2001;
Whereas, in the words of former Secretary of the Navy Gordon England, ``The 
        courage and heroism of the people aboard the flight will never be 
        forgotten and USS Somerset will leave a legacy that will never be 
        forgotten by those wishing to do harm to this country.'';
Whereas the USS Somerset joins the USS New York (LPD-21) and the USS Arlington 
        (LPD-24) in remembering the heroes of September 11, 2001;
Whereas the USS Somerset was christened in July 2012 and will be commissioned 
        when it is put in active service;
Whereas the Navy has cleared Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a potential site for 
        the commissioning ceremony of the USS Somerset; and
Whereas Philadelphia is one of the closest ports to Somerset County, and it 
        would be fitting that the commissioning ceremony be held there: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate encourages the Navy to commission the USS 
Somerset (LPD-25) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
