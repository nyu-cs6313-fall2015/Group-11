                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the Senate on the 10-year anniversary of NATO 
                     Allied Command Transformation.

&lt;DELETED&gt;Whereas, on June 19, 2003, NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT), 
        was formally established to increase military effectiveness and prepare 
        the Alliance for future security challenges;
Whereas, on June 19, 2013, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will 
        celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the establishment of NATO ACT;
Whereas the security of the United States and its NATO allies have been enhanced 
        by the establishment and continued work of NATO ACT;
Whereas, for the past 10 years, ACT has been leading the charge for NATO 
        military transformation, and providing relevant and timely support to 
        NATO operations, and developing partnerships around the globe to adapt 
        to the changing global security environment;
Whereas ACT is the only NATO headquarters in the United States, and the only 
        permanent NATO headquarters outside of Europe;
Whereas ACT provides state-of-the-art education, training, and application of 
        best practices and lessons learned from past operations, and equips 
        Alliance troops with the tools they need to win today's wars;
Whereas ACT improves NATO's defense planning and develops compatible equipment 
        and common standards necessary to keep Alliance capabilities aligned;
Whereas NATO ACT has been integral to a NATO mission of promoting a Europe that 
        is whole, undivided, free, and at peace;
Whereas NATO ACT strengthened the ability of NATO to perform a full range of 
        missions throughout the world;
Whereas NATO ACT has provided crucial support and participation in the NATO 
        International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, as NATO 
        endeavors to help the people of Afghanistan create the conditions 
        necessary for security and successful development and reconstruction;
Whereas ACT employs personnel from 26 NATO member nations and 6 NATO Partner 
        nations and contributes more than $100,000,000 annually to the local 
        economy;
Whereas NATO has been the cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation and 
        an enduring instrument for promoting stability in Europe and throughout 
        the world for over 60 years, representing the vital transatlantic bond 
        of solidarity between the United States and Europe, as NATO nations 
        share similar values and interests and are committed to the maintenance 
        of democratic principles;
Whereas the Chicago Summit Communique affirms that all NATO members ``are 
        determined that NATO will continue to play its unique and essential role 
        in ensuring our common defense and security'' and that NATO ``continues 
        to be effective in a changing world, against new threats, with new 
        capabilities and new partners'';
Whereas, through the Alliance, the United States and Europe are effective and 
        steadfast partners in security, and ACT is well positioned to contribute 
        to the strength of the Alliance on both continents;
Whereas NATO ACT has done much to help NATO meet the global challenges of the 
        21st century, including the threat of terrorism, the spread of weapons 
        of mass destruction, instability caused by failed states, and threats to 
        global energy security; and
Whereas the 10th anniversary of NATO ACT is an opportunity to enhance and more 
        deeply entrench those principles, which continue to bind the alliance 
        together and guide our efforts today: Now, therefore, be it
&lt;/DELETED&gt;Whereas, on June 19, 2003, NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT),
