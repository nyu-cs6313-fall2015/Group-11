                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for the Ukrainian people in light of President 
  Yanukovych's decision not to sign an Association Agreement with the 
                            European Union.

Whereas, according to a poll conducted in November 2013, a majority of the 
        people of Ukraine supported signing a historic trade and political 
        agreement with the European Union;
Whereas a closer association between Ukraine and the European Union has been 
        supported by Ukrainian civil society, business leaders, and politicians 
        across the political spectrum and would bring lasting political, 
        democratic, and economic benefits to the people of Ukraine;
Whereas Ukraine successfully passed much of the legislation required to conform 
        to European Union standards for signing an Association Agreement;
Whereas, on September 22, 2012, and November 18, 2013, the Senate unanimously 
        passed resolutions calling for a demonstrable end to selective justice 
        in Ukraine and expressing its belief that Ukraine's future lies with 
        stronger ties to Europe, the United States, and others in the community 
        of democracies;
Whereas the experience of countries such as Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and 
        Estonia provides a positive example of increased economic opportunity, 
        enhanced personal freedom, and good governance. which can also be 
        realized by Ukraine;
Whereas the Government and people of Ukraine have the sovereign right to choose 
        their own foreign policy and economic course, and no other country has 
        the right to determine their political and economic orientation, nor 
        decide which alliances and trade agreements they can join;
Whereas, on November 21, 2013, President Viktor Yanukovych suspended Ukraine's 
        preparations for signing the Association Agreement one week before a 
        critical European Union Summit in Vilnius, Lithuania;
Whereas the abrupt reversal on the eve of the summit following Russian economic 
        coercion and to protect the narrow interests of some officials and 
        individuals in Ukraine prompted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians all 
        across the country, especially young people and students, to protest the 
        decision and stand in support of furthering Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic 
        integration;
Whereas international nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations provide 
        essential care to needy Ukrainians, yet face direct threats and 
        challenges to their existence and administrative and regulatory 
        impediments, including challenges to operating with the tax-exempt 
        status necessary to maximize the use of funds on the ground and threats 
        to the fabric of civil society vital to democracy in Ukraine;
Whereas, on November 30, 2013, at Independence Square in Kyiv, special division 
        police dispersed a peaceful demonstration of students and civil society 
        activists who were calling on President Yanukovych to sign the 
        Association Agreement;
Whereas approximately 35 individuals were detained or arrested, and dozens were 
        hospitalized, some with severe injuries;
Whereas, on December 9, 2013, raids were conducted on three opposition media 
        outlets and the headquarters of one opposition party;
Whereas, on December 11, 2013, Ukrainian authorities conducted an overnight 
        police operation in an attempt to forcefully take control of 
        Independence Square, but were resisted by brave Ukrainians who filled 
        the square and rebuffed the police action;
Whereas all three former Presidents of Ukraine have underscored the need to 
        refrain from violence and the importance of engaging in a dialogue with 
        the opposition; and
Whereas Ukraine faces an impending economic crisis that can only be solved with 
        long-term economic reforms: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) stands with the people of Ukraine and supports their 
        sovereign right to chart an independent and democratic future 
        for their country;
            (2) urges leaders in the United States and the European 
        Union to continue working together actively to support a 
        peaceful and democratic resolution to the current crisis that 
        moves Ukraine toward a future in the Euro-Atlantic community 
        and a long-term solution to Ukraine's economic crisis;
            (3) encourages demonstrators and members of the opposition 
        and civil society in Ukraine to continue avoiding the use of 
        violence and engage in a dialogue of national reconciliation;
            (4) urges all political parties to refrain from hate speech 
        or actions of an anti-Semitic or other character which further 
        divide the Ukrainian people when they need to be united;
            (5) calls on the Government of Ukraine to refrain from 
        further use of force or acts of violence against peaceful 
        protestors, and to respect the internationally recognized human 
        rights of the Ukrainian people, especially the freedoms of 
        speech and assembly;
            (6) condemns the decision by Ukrainian authorities to use 
        violence against peaceful demonstrators on November 30, 
        December 1, and December 11, 2013, and calls for those 
        responsible to be swiftly brought to justice and all detained 
        nonviolent demonstrators to be immediately released; and
            (7) notes that in the event of further state violence 
        against peaceful protestors, the President and Congress should 
        consider whether to apply targeted sanctions, including visa 
        bans and asset freezes, against individuals responsible for 
        ordering or carrying out the violence.
