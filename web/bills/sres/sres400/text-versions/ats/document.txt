                               RESOLUTION


 
    Recognizing the 50<SUP>th</SUP> anniversary of the Great Alaska 
   Earthquake, which struck the State of Alaska at 5:36 p.m. on Good 
  Friday, March 27, 1964, honoring those who lost their lives in the 
    Great Alaska Earthquake and associated tsunamis, and expressing 
continued support for research on earthquake and tsunami prediction and 
                         mitigation strategies.

Whereas on Good Friday, March 27, 1964, the Great Alaska Earthquake struck the 
        State of Alaska;
Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake measured 9.2 on the moment magnitude scale, 
        making it the largest recorded earthquake in United States history and 
        the second-largest earthquake ever recorded using modern instruments;
Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake was felt as far away as Seattle and was 
        registered by water-level recorders in 47 States;
Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake spawned tsunamis that devastated communities 
        in Alaska and impacted the States of Washington, Oregon, California, and 
        Hawaii, as well as Canada and Japan;
Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake and associated tsunamis resulted in 131 
        fatalities, including 4 fatalities in Oregon and 12 fatalities in 
        California, and an estimated $3,750,000,000 in property losses in 
        today's dollars;
Whereas the wealth of data collected during the Great Alaska Earthquake led to 
        major breakthroughs in the scientific understanding of subduction zone 
        earthquakes and earthquake hazards, resulting in improved earthquake 
        mitigation strategies;
Whereas the study of the tsunamis associated with the Great Alaska Earthquake 
        resulted in improved tsunami prediction and warning capabilities; and
Whereas the Great Alaska Earthquake spurred the United States Geological Survey, 
        in cooperation with earthquake-impacted States, to install extensive 
        earthquake monitoring networks across the United States and establish 
        the National Center for Earthquake Research: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) mourns the lives lost due to the Great Alaska 
        Earthquake and associated tsunamis that occurred on Good 
        Friday, March 27, 1964;
            (2) recognizes the improved understanding of earthquakes 
        and tsunamis and the scientific and technological advancements 
        that resulted from the study of data collected during the Great 
        Alaska Earthquake;
            (3) commends the efforts of scientists and engineers from 
        the United States Geological Survey, as well as those in 
        Alaska, California, and other earthquake-impacted States, to 
        improve earthquake and tsunami prediction and hazard mitigation 
        strategies and protect the well-being of United States citizens 
        threatened by these hazards;
            (4) supports continued research, education, and outreach 
        about earthquakes and other natural hazards; and
            (5) encourages participation in the Great Alaska ShakeOut 
        earthquake drill scheduled to occur on March 27, 2014.
