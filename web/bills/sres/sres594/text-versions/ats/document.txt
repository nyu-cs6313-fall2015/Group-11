        the Polish government-in-exile detailing the horrific brutality of the 
        Nazis in Warsaw;
Whereas Jan Karski risked his life on several occasions, including when he

        government-in-exile, the British government, and the United States 
        Government;

        until his retirement in 1984;
Whereas Jan Karski became a citizen of the United States in 1954;
Whereas Jan Karski was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in
