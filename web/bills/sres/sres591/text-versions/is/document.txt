      Supporting the goals and ideals of American Education Week.

Whereas November 16 through November 22, 2014, marks the 93rd annual observance 
        of ``American Education Week'';
Whereas public schools are the backbone of democracy in the United States, 
        providing young people with the tools necessary to maintain the values 
        of freedom, civility, and equality that are precious to the United 
        States;
Whereas by equipping young people in the United States with both practical 
        skills and broader intellectual abilities, public schools give them hope 
        for, and access to, a productive future;
Whereas people working in the field of public education, whether teachers, 
        higher education faculty and staff, paraeducators, custodians, 
        substitute educators, bus drivers, clerical workers, food service 
        professionals, workers in skilled trades, health and student service 
        workers, security guards, technical employees, or librarians, work 
        tirelessly to serve children and communities throughout the United 
        States with care and professionalism; and
Whereas public schools are community linchpins, bringing together adults, 
        children, educators, volunteers, business leaders, and elected officials 
        in a common enterprise: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of American Education 
        Week; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        American Education Week by reflecting on the positive impact of 
        all individuals who work together to educate children.
                                 <all>
