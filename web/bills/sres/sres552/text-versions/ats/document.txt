                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of afterschool 
                   programs held on October 23, 2014.

Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States have parents who work 
        outside the home and approximately 15,100,000 children in the United 
        States have no place to go after school;
Whereas high-quality programs that expand learning opportunities for children, 
        such as afterschool, before-school, summer, and expanded learning 
        programs, provide safe, challenging, engaging, and fun learning 
        experiences, including many that emphasize science, technology, 
        engineering, and math, that help children and youth develop social, 
        emotional, physical, cultural, and academic skills;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs and high-quality expanded learning 
        programs provide students with hands-on, engaging lessons that are 
        aligned with the school day;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs complement regular and expanded school 
        days, and support working families by ensuring that the children of 
        those families are safe and productive during the hours parents are 
        working;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs engage families, schools, and diverse 
        community partners in advancing the well-being of children and youth in 
        the United States;
Whereas high-quality afterschool programs that partner with high-quality 
        community-based organizations build stronger communities by integrating 
        the school with the larger community;
Whereas Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of afterschool, before-
        school, summer, and expanded learning programs held on October 23, 2014, 
        highlights the critical importance of these high-quality programs in the 
        lives of children, their families, and their communities; and
Whereas nearly 2 in 5 afterschool programs report that their budgets are in 
        worse condition today than at the height of the recession in 2008, and 
        more than 3 in 5 afterschool programs report that their level of funding 
        is lower than it was 3 years ago, making it difficult for afterschool 
        programs across the United States to keep their doors open and their 
        lights on: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports Lights On Afterschool, a 
national celebration of afterschool programs held on October 23, 2014.
                                 <all>
