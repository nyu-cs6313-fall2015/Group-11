                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

   Mr. Franken (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Markey, Mr. Cochran, Mr.

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the month of October 2014 as ``National Principals Month''.

Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National 
        Association of Elementary School Principals have declared the month of 
        October 2014 to be ``National Principals Month'';
Whereas principals are educational visionaries, instructional and assessment 
        leaders, disciplinarians, community builders, budget analysts, 
        facilities managers, and administrators of legal and contractual 
        obligations;
Whereas principals work collaboratively with teachers and parents to develop and 
        implement a clear mission, high curriculum standards, and performance 
        goals;
Whereas principals create school environments that facilitate great teaching and 
        learning and continuous school improvement;
Whereas the vision, actions, and dedication of principals provide the mobilizing 
        force behind any school reform effort; and
Whereas the celebration of National Principals Month would honor elementary 
        school, middle school, and high school principals, and recognize the 
        importance of principals in ensuring that every child has access to a 
        high-quality education: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the month of October 2014 as ``National 
        Principals Month''; and
            (2) honors the contribution of principals in the elementary 
        schools, middle schools, and high schools of the United States 
        by supporting the goals and ideals of National Principals 
        Month.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
