                            October 31, 2013

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the United States Senate that President Obama 
    should issue a statement regarding spying on His Holiness, Pope 
                                Francis.

Whereas public news reports this week indicate that the United States National 
        Security Agency monitored millions of phone calls in Italy in late 2012 
        and early 2013;
Whereas these reports indicate that the National Security Agency monitored 
        telephone calls made to and from a residence in Rome where then 
        Archbishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio stayed during the conclave selecting 
        Bergoglio, now known as His Holiness Pope Francis, to succeed Pope 
        Benedict XVI;
Whereas this story has been widely reported in the American and international 
        media;
Whereas the National Security Agency has reportedly denied the allegations; and
Whereas these allegations are serious and President Obama should personally 
        address these reports: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that President Obama 
should directly address the serious allegation whether his 
administration monitored the calls of Pope Francis or the conclave 
selecting the Pope.
