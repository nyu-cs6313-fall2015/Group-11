_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating December 13, 2014, as ``Wreaths Across America Day''.

Whereas 23 years ago, the Wreaths Across America project began an annual 
        tradition of donating, transporting, and placing Maine balsam fir 
        remembrance wreaths on the graves of our fallen heroes at Arlington 
        National Cemetery during the month of December;
Whereas more than 1,700,000 wreaths have been sent to locations, including 
        national cemeteries and veterans memorials, in every State and overseas;
Whereas the mission of the Wreaths Across America project to ``Remember, Honor, 
        Teach'' is carried out in part by coordinating wreath-laying ceremonies 
        at Arlington National Cemetery as well as veterans cemeteries and other 
        locations in all 50 States and overseas;
Whereas the Wreaths Across America project carries out a week-long veterans 
        parade between Maine and Virginia, stopping along the way to spread a 
        message about the importance of remembering the fallen heroes of the 
        United States, honoring those who serve, and teaching the people of the 
        United States about the sacrifices made by veterans and their families 
        to preserve freedom in the United States;
Whereas in 2013, remembrance wreaths were sent to more than 900 locations across 
        the United States and overseas, 100 more locations than the previous 
        year;
Whereas in December 2014, the Patriot Guard Riders, along with other patriotic 
        groups, will continue the tradition of escorting tractor-trailers filled 
        with donated wreaths from Harrington, Maine, to Arlington National 
        Cemetery;
Whereas the Nation's trucking industry continues to support Wreaths Across 
        America by providing drivers, equipment, and related services to assist 
        in the transportation of wreaths to over 1,000 locations across the 
        country;
Whereas thousands of individuals volunteer each December to lay remembrance 
        wreaths;
Whereas 2014 is the 150th Anniversary of Arlington National Cemetery, where some 
        230,000 markers stand in honor of those who have served this country;
Whereas this year, it is the aspiration of Wreaths Across America to lay a 
        wreath at the grave of every veteran buried at Arlington National 
        Cemetery;
Whereas December 14, 2013, was previously designated by the Senate as ``Wreaths 
        Across America Day''; and
Whereas, on December 13, 2014, the Wreaths Across America project will continue 
        the proud legacy of bringing remembrance wreaths to Arlington National 
        Cemetery to honor our veterans: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates December 13, 2014, as ``Wreaths Across 
        America Day'';
            (2) honors the Wreaths Across America project, the Patriot 
        Guard Riders, the trucking industry, and all of the volunteers 
        and donors involved in this worthy tradition; and
            (3) recognizes the service and sacrifice that our veterans, 
        members of the Armed Forces, and their families have made, and 
        continue to make, for our great Nation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
