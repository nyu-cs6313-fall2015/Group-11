                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the week beginning September 15, 2013, as ``National 
                 Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week''.

Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are degree-granting institutions that have 
        a full-time equivalent undergraduate enrollment of at least 25 percent 
        Hispanic students;
Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions play an important role in educating many 
        underprivileged students and helping those students attain their full 
        potential through higher education;
Whereas more than 350 Hispanic-Serving Institutions operate in the United 
        States;
Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions serve more than half, or 56 percent, of 
        all Hispanic students, enrolling more than 1,480,000 students in 2011;
Whereas Hispanic-Serving Institutions are actively involved in stabilizing and 
        improving the communities in which the institutions are located;
Whereas celebrating the vast contributions of Hispanic-Serving Institutions to 
        the United States strengthens the culture of the United States; and
Whereas the achievements and goals of Hispanic-Serving Institutions deserve 
        national recognition: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the achievements and goals of Hispanic-
        Serving Institutions across the United States;
            (2) designates the week beginning September 15, 2013, as 
        ``National Hispanic-Serving Institutions Week''; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States and interested 
        groups to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, 
        activities, and programs to demonstrate support for Hispanic-
        Serving Institutions.
                                 <all>
