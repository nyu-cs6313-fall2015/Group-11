        National Security Council, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the 
        Joint Chiefs of Staff, thereby laying the foundation for today's 
        intelligence community;
Whereas the National Security Act of 1947, which appears in title 50 of the 
        United States Code, governs the definition, composition, 
        responsibilities, authorities, and oversight of the intelligence 
        community of the United States;
Whereas the intelligence community is defined by section 3(4) of the National

        Director of National Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the

Whereas July 26, 2012, was the 65th anniversary of the signing of the National 
        Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);
Whereas the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (Public Law 
        108-458; 118 Stat. 3638) created the position of the Director of 
        National Intelligence to serve as the head of the intelligence community 
        and to ensure that national intelligence be timely, objective, 
        independent of political considerations, and based upon all sources 
        available;
Whereas Congress has previously passed joint resolutions, signed by the 
        President, to designate Peace Officers Memorial Day on May 15, Patriot 
        Day on September 11, and other commemorative occasions, to honor the 
        sacrifices of law enforcement officers and of those who lost their lives 
        on September 11, 2001;
Whereas the United States has increasingly relied upon the men and women of the 
        intelligence community to protect and defend the security of the United 
        States in the decade since the attacks of September 11, 2001;
Whereas the men and women of the intelligence community, both civilian and 
        military, have been increasingly called upon to deploy to theaters of 
        war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere since September 11, 2001;
Whereas numerous intelligence officers of the elements of the intelligence 
        community have been injured or killed in the line of duty;
Whereas intelligence officers of the United States are routinely called upon to 
        accept personal hardship and sacrifice in the furtherance of their 
        mission to protect the United States, to undertake dangerous assignments 
        in the defense of the interests of the United States, to collect 
        reliable information within prescribed legal authorities upon which the 
        leaders of the United States rely in life-and-death situations, and to 
        ``speak truth to power'' by providing their best assessments to 
        decisionmakers, regardless of political and policy considerations;
Whereas the men and women of the intelligence community have on numerous 
        occasions succeeded in preventing attacks upon the United States and 
        allies of the United States, saving numerous innocent lives; and
Whereas intelligence officers of the United States must of necessity often 
        remain unknown and unrecognized for their substantial achievements and 
        successes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates July 26, 2014, as ``United States 
        Intelligence Professionals Day'';
            (2) acknowledges the courage, fidelity, sacrifice, and 
        professionalism of the men and women of the intelligence 
        community of the United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
