 Congratulating the Penn State University women's volleyball team for 
   winning the 2013 National Collegiate Athletic Association Women's 
                        Volleyball Championship.

Whereas on December 21, 2013, the Penn State University Nittany Lions won the 
        2013 National Collegiate Athletic Association (``NCAA'') Women's 
        Volleyball Championship in Seattle, Washington with a hard-fought 
        victory over the University of Wisconsin Badgers in a thrilling four-set 
        match;
Whereas the Penn State University Nittany Lions have won 5 of the last 7 NCAA 
        women's volleyball championships and 6 overall, matching the Stanford 
        University Cardinal for the most NCAA Division I women's volleyball 
        championships by a single program;
Whereas the Penn State University Nittany Lions concluded the 2013 season with a 
        record of 34 wins and only 2 losses, and a 16&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; Big Ten 
        Conference title;
Whereas 4 Nittany Lions players were selected for the 2013 NCAA All-Tournament 
        team and junior setter Micha Hancock was named the tournament's Most 
        Outstanding Player;
Whereas head coach Russ Rose was named the 2013 National Coach of the Year and 
        has been at the helm of the Nittany Lions women's volleyball team for 34 
        seasons, never winning less than 22 games in a season; and
Whereas this season, Coach Rose and his staff depended on 4 seniors to lead by 
        example on the court and in the classroom, as best illustrated by Ariel 
        Scott and Maggie Harding, who were each awarded prestigious academic 
        honors: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Penn State University women's 
        volleyball team for winning the 2013 National Collegiate 
        Athletic Association Championship;
            (2) commends the Penn State University women's volleyball 
        team players, coaches, and staff for their hard work and 
        dedication; and
            (3) recognizes the Penn State University students, alumni, 
        and loyal fans who supported the Nittany Lions on their way to 
        capturing a record-tying sixth National Collegiate Athletic 
        Association Championship.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
