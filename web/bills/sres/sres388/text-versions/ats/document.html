  Designating March 22, 2014, as ``National Rehabilitation Counselors 
                          Appreciation Day''.

Whereas rehabilitation counselors conduct assessments, provide counseling, 
        support families, and plan and implement rehabilitation programs for 
        individuals in need of rehabilitation;
Whereas the purpose of professional organizations for rehabilitation counseling 
        and education is to promote the improvement of rehabilitation services 
        available to individuals with disabilities through quality education for 
        counselors and rehabilitation research;
Whereas various professional organizations have vigorously advocated up-to-date 
        education and training and the maintenance of professional standards in 
        the field of rehabilitation counseling and education, including--

    (1) the National Rehabilitation Association;

    (2) the Rehabilitation Counselors and Educators Association;

    (3) the National Council on Rehabilitation Education;

    (4) the National Rehabilitation Counseling Association;

    (5) the American Rehabilitation Counseling Association;

    (6) the Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification;

and

    (8) the Council on Rehabilitation Education;

Whereas, on March 22, 1983, Martha Walker of Kent State University, who was 
        President of the National Council on Rehabilitation Education, testified 
        before the Subcommittee on Select Education of the Committee on 
        Education and Labor of the House of Representatives, and was 
        instrumental in bringing the need for qualified rehabilitation 
        counselors to the attention of Congress; and
Whereas the efforts of Martha Walker led to the enactment of laws that require 
        rehabilitation counselors to have proper credentials, in order to 
        provide a higher quality of service to those in need of rehabilitation: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 22, 2014, as ``National Rehabilitation 
        Counselors Appreciation Day''; and
            (2) commends--
                    (A) rehabilitation counselors, for the dedication 
                and hard work rehabilitation counselors provide to 
                individuals in need of rehabilitation; and
                    (B) professional organizations, for the efforts 
                professional organizations have made to assist those 
                who require rehabilitation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
