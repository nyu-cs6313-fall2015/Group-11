                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              May 15, 2014

   Mr. McConnell (for himself and Mr. Paul) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the 50&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; anniversary of the Congressional 
 declaration of bourbon whiskey as a distinctive product of the United 
                                States.

Whereas on May 4, 1964, Congress declared bourbon whiskey a distinctive product 
        of the United States that is unlike other types of alcoholic beverages, 
        whether foreign or domestic;
Whereas to be designated as ``bourbon,'' a product must conform to high 
        standards and be manufactured in accordance with the laws and 
        regulations of the United States, which prescribe Federal Standards of 
        Identity for ``bourbon whisky'';
Whereas bourbon whiskey has achieved recognition and acceptance throughout the 
        world as a distinctive product of the United States;
Whereas Kentucky, the birthplace of bourbon, produces 95 percent of the world's 
        supply;
Whereas Kentucky's iconic bourbon brands are reaching farther than ever, with 
        more than 30,000,000 gallons shipped to 126 countries, making bourbon 
        the largest export category among all United States distilled spirits 
        and a source of national pride;
Whereas bourbon production has increased by more than 120 percent since 1999, 
        contributing to the development of a vibrant bourbon tourism industry in 
        Kentucky;
Whereas bourbon is a vital part of American culture and the economy, generating 
        close to 9,000 jobs in Kentucky and almost $2,000,000,000 in gross 
        Kentucky product in 2010; and
Whereas the bourbon industry continues its efforts to promote the responsible 
        and moderate use of its product, and to curb drunken driving and 
        underage drinking: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 50&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; 
anniversary of the Congressional declaration of bourbon whiskey as a 
distinctive product of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
