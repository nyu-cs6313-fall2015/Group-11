[S. Res. 162 Engrossed in Senate (ES)]

S. Res. 162

                  In the Senate of the United States,

                                                          June 4, 2013.
Whereas a stroke, also known as cerebrovascular disease, is an acute neurologic 
        injury that occurs when the blood supply to a part of the brain is 
        interrupted by a clot in the artery or a burst of the artery;
Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause permanent neurologic 
        damage or even death if not promptly diagnosed and treated;
Whereas stroke occurs in approximately 1 out of every 3,500 live births, and has 
        an overall annual incidence of 4.6 per 100,000 children age 19 and 
        under;
Whereas a stroke can occur before birth;
Whereas stroke is among the top 12 causes of death for children between the ages 
        of 1 and 14 in the United States;
Whereas 20 to 40 percent of children who have suffered a stroke die as a result;
Whereas stroke recurs within 5 years in 10 percent of children who have had an 
        ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke;
Whereas the death rate for children who experience a stroke before the age of 1 
        year is the highest out of all child age groups;
Whereas there are no approved therapies for the treatment of acute stroke in 
        infants and children;
Whereas approximately 60 percent of infants and children who have a pediatric 
        stroke will have serious, permanent neurological disabilities, including 
        paralysis, seizures, speech and vision problems, and attention, 
        learning, and behavioral difficulties;
Whereas those disabilities may require ongoing physical therapy and surgeries;
Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments resulting from strokes that 
        occur during childhood and young adulthood have a considerable impact on 
        children, families, and society;
Whereas not enough is known about the cause, treatment, and prevention of 
        pediatric stroke;
Whereas medical research is the only means by which the people of the United 
        States can identify and develop effective treatment and prevention 
        strategies for pediatric stroke; and
Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of pediatric stroke greatly improves the 
        chances that the affected child will recover and not experience a 
        recurrence: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes May 2013 as ``National Pediatric Stroke Awareness 
        Month'';
            (2) urges the people of the United States to support the efforts, 
        programs, services, and organizations that work to enhance public 
        awareness of pediatric stroke;
            (3) supports the work of the National Institutes of Health in 
        pursuit of medical progress on the matter of pediatric stroke; and
            (4) urges continued coordination and cooperation between the Federal 
        Government, State and local governments, researchers, families, and the 
        public to improve treatments and prognoses for children who suffer 
        strokes.
            Attest:

                                                                      Secretary.
