                               RESOLUTION


 
        Designating February 28, 2014, as ``Rare Disease Day''.

Whereas a rare disease or disorder is one that affects a small number of 
        patients - in the United States, typically less than 200,000 individuals 
        annually;
Whereas as of the date of approval of this resolution, nearly 7,000 rare 
        diseases affect approximately 30,000,000 people in the United States and 
        their families;
Whereas children with rare genetic diseases account for more than half of the 
        population affected by rare diseases in the United States;
Whereas many rare diseases are serious, life-threatening, and lack an effective 
        treatment;
Whereas great strides have been made in research and treatment for rare diseases 
        as a result of the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97-414);
Whereas the Food and Drug Administration has made great strides in involving the 
        patient in the drug review process as part of its Patient-Focused Drug 
        Development program, an initiative that originated in the Food and Drug 
        Administration Safety and Innovation Act (Public Law 112-144);
Whereas a third of all treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
        in 2013 were orphan products intended to treat rare diseases;
Whereas lack of access to effective treatments and difficulty in obtaining 
        reimbursement for life-altering, and even life-saving, treatments still 
        exist and remain significant challenges for the rare disease community 
        and their families;
Whereas rare diseases and conditions include epidermolysis bullosa, progeria, 
        sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), Duchenne muscular 
        dystrophy (DMD), Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, many 
        childhood cancers, and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva;
Whereas people with rare diseases experience challenges that include difficulty 
        in obtaining accurate diagnoses, limited treatment options, and 
        difficulty finding physicians or treatment centers with expertise in 
        their diseases;
Whereas the rare disease community made great strides in 2013, including the 
        passage of the National Pediatric Research Network Act (Public Law 113-
        55), which calls special attention to rare diseases and directs the 
        National Institutes of Health to facilitate greater collaboration among 
        researchers;
Whereas both the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of 
        Health have established special offices to advocate for rare disease 
        research and treatments;
Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders, an organization 
        established in 1983 to provide services to and advocate on behalf of 
        patients with rare diseases, remains a critical public voice for people 
        with rare diseases;
Whereas 2013 marked the 30th anniversary of the Orphan Drug Act and the National 
        Organization for Rare Disorders;
Whereas the National Organization for Rare Disorders sponsors Rare Disease Day 
        in the United States to increase public awareness of rare diseases;
Whereas Rare Disease Day is observed each year on the last day of February;
Whereas Rare Disease Day is a global event, first observed in the United States 
        on February 28, 2009, and observed in 60 countries in 2013; and
Whereas Rare Disease Day is expected to be observed globally for years to come, 
        providing hope and information for rare disease patients around the 
        world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates February 28, 2014, as ``Rare Disease Day'';
            (2) recognizes the importance of improving awareness and 
        encouraging accurate and early diagnosis of rare diseases and 
        disorders; and
            (3) supports a national and global commitment to improving 
        access to, and developing new treatments, diagnostics, and 
        cures for rare diseases and disorders.
                                 <all>
