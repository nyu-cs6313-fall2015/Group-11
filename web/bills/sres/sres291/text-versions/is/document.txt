                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the Senate on a nationwide moment of 
remembrance on Memorial Day each year, in order to appropriately honor 
United States patriots lost in the pursuit of peace and liberty around 
                               the world.

Whereas the preservation of basic freedoms and world peace has always been a 
        valued objective of the United States;
Whereas thousands of United States men and women have selflessly given their 
        lives in service as peacemakers and peacekeepers;
Whereas the American people should continue to demonstrate the appreciation and 
        gratitude these patriots deserve and to commemorate the ultimate 
        sacrifice they made;
Whereas Memorial Day is the day of the year for the United States to 
        appropriately remember United States heroes by inviting the people of 
        the United States to respectfully honor them at a designated time; and
Whereas the playing of ``Taps'' symbolizes the solemn and patriotic recognition 
        of those Americans who died in service to the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the people of the United States should, as part of a 
        moment of remembrance on Memorial Day each year, observe that 
        moment with the playing of ``Taps'' in honor of the people of 
        the United States who gave their lives in the pursuit of 
        freedom and peace; and
            (2) the playing of ``Taps'' should take place at widely 
        attended public events on Memorial Day, including sporting 
        events and civic ceremonies.
                                 <all>
