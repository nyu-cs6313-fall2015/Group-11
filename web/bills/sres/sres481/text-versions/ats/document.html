                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the month of June 2014 as ``National Post-Traumatic Stress 
                      Disorder Awareness Month''.

Whereas the brave men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, who 
        proudly serve the United States, risk their lives to protect the freedom 
        of the people of the United States, and deserve the investment of every 
        possible resource to ensure their lasting physical, mental, and 
        emotional well-being;
Whereas more than 2,600,000 members of the Armed Forces have deployed overseas 
        since the events of September 11, 2001, and have served in places such 
        as Afghanistan and Iraq;
Whereas the Armed Forces of the United States have sustained a historically high 
        operational tempo since September 11, 2001, with many members of the 
        Armed Forces deploying overseas multiple times, placing those members at 
        high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this 
        preamble as ``PTSD'');
Whereas members of the Armed Forces and veterans who served before September 11, 
        2001, remain at risk for PTSD and other mental health disorders;
Whereas the Secretary of Veterans Affairs reports that--

    (1) since October 2001, more than 310,000 of the approximately 
1,000,000 veterans of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
and Operation New Dawn who have received health care from the Department of 
Veterans Affairs have been diagnosed with PTSD;

    (2) in fiscal year 2013, more than 530,000 of the nearly 6,000,000 
veterans who sought care at Department of Veterans Affairs medical 
facilities received treatment for PTSD; and

    (3) of veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation 
Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn who are receiving health care from 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than 570,000 have received a 
diagnosis for at least 1 mental health disorder;

Whereas many cases of PTSD remain unreported, undiagnosed, and untreated due to 
        a lack of awareness about PTSD and the persistent stigma associated with 
        mental health conditions;
Whereas exposure to military sexual trauma can lead to PTSD;
Whereas PTSD significantly increases the risk of anxiety, depression, suicide, 
        homelessness, and drug- and alcohol-related disorders and deaths, 
        especially if left untreated;
Whereas public perceptions of PTSD or other mental health disorders create 
        unique challenges for veterans seeking employment;
Whereas the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs--as 
        well as the larger medical community, both private and public--have made 
        significant advances in the identification, prevention, diagnosis, and 
        treatment of PTSD and the symptoms of PTSD, but many challenges remain;
Whereas increased understanding of PTSD can help diminish the stigma attached to 
        this mental health disorder, and additional efforts are needed to find 
        further ways--including an examination of how PTSD is discussed in the 
        United States--to reduce this stigma; and
Whereas the designation of a National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness 
        Month will raise public awareness about issues related to PTSD, reduce 
        the stigma associated with PTSD, and help ensure that those suffering 
        from the invisible wounds of war receive proper treatment: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 2014, as ``National Post-Traumatic 
        Stress Disorder Awareness Month'';
            (2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense--as well as the entire 
        medical community--to educate members of the Armed Forces, 
        veterans, the families of members of the Armed Forces and 
        veterans, and the public about the causes, symptoms, and 
        treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder; and
            (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs and the Secretary of Defense.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
