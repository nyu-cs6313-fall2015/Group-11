                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating September 22, 2013, as ``National Falls Prevention 
  Awareness Day'' to raise awareness and encourage the prevention of 
                       falls among older adults.

Whereas older adults, 65 years of age and older, are the fastest-growing segment 
        of the population in the United States, and the number of older adults 
        in the United States will increase from 35,000,000 in 2000 to 72,100,000 
        in 2030;
Whereas 1 out of 3 older adults in the United States falls each year;
Whereas falls are the leading cause of death and hospital admissions for 
        injuries among older adults;
Whereas, in 2010, approximately 2,300,000 older adults were treated in hospital 
        emergency departments for fall-related injuries, and more than 650,000 
        were subsequently hospitalized;
Whereas, in 2010, more than 21,000 older adults died from injuries related to 
        unintentional falls;
Whereas the total annual medical cost of fall-related injuries for older adults 
        is estimated at $30,000,000,000;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that if the rate 
        of increase in falls is not slowed, the total annual medical cost of 
        fall-related injuries for older adults will reach $59,600,000,000 by 
        2020; and
Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing falls by utilizing 
        cost-effective strategies, such as comprehensive clinical assessments, 
        exercise programs to improve balance and health, medication management, 
        vision correction, and reduction of home hazards: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 22, 2013, as ``National Falls 
        Prevention Awareness Day'';
            (2) recognizes that there are proven, cost-effective falls 
        prevention programs and policies;
            (3) commends the Falls Free Coalition and the falls 
        prevention coalitions in 42 States and the District of Columbia 
        for their efforts to work together to increase education and 
        awareness about the prevention of falls among older adults;
            (4) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and 
        local governments, the public health community, and health care 
        providers to work together to raise awareness of falls in an 
        effort to reduce the incidence of falls among older adults in 
        the United States;
            (5) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to 
        continue developing and evaluating interventions to prevent 
        falls among older adults that will translate into effective 
        community-based falls prevention programs;
            (6) urges the Administration for Community Living, the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and associated 
        partners to continue to promote evidence-based programs and 
        services in communities in the United States to reduce the 
        number of older adults at risk for falls;
            (7) encourages State health departments, which provide 
        significant leadership in reducing injuries and injury-related 
        health care costs by collaborating with organizations and 
        individuals, to reduce falls among older adults; and
            (8) encourages experts in the field of falls prevention to 
        share their best practices so that their success can be 
        replicated by others.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
