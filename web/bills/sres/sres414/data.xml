  <summary>4/7/2014--Passed Senate without amendment.
Designates April 2014 as National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Month.

Declares that steps should be taken to: (1) raise awareness of and increase public knowledge about congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH); (2) inform minority populations about CDH; (3) disseminate information on the importance of quality neonatal care for CDH patients; (4) promote quality prenatal care and the use of ultrasounds to detect CDH in utero; and (5) increase research funding in an amount commensurate with the burden of CDH to improve screening and treatment for it, discover its causes, and develop a cure for it.</summary>
