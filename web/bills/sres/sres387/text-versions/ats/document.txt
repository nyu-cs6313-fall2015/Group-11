                               RESOLUTION


 
    Celebrating the 2014 Arctic Winter Games, in Fairbanks, Alaska.

Whereas the Arctic Winter Games, held every 2 years, is a premier sporting and 
        cultural event and a true celebration of athletic competition, 
        friendship, and cooperation among individuals living in the Arctic;
Whereas the Arctic Winter Games, as envisioned over 40 years ago by Alaska 
        Governor Wally Hickel and commissioners from the Northwest Territories 
        and Yukon, continues to promote the core values of its creation: 
        athletic competition, cultural exhibition, and social interchange;
Whereas the Fairbanks North Star Borough has a uniquely qualified community to 
        welcome the vast cultural benefits that accompany serving as the host of 
        the 2014 Arctic Winter Games;
Whereas the 2014 Arctic Winter Games welcomes more than 1,400 athletes from 9 
        contingents, representing nations that include the United States, 
        Canada, Greenland, and Russia;
Whereas the State of Alaska is proud to contribute to the Arctic Winter Games 
        287 Alaskan athletes, ages 13 to 24; and
Whereas the 2014 Arctic Winter Games marks the fifth Arctic Winter Games hosted 
        in Alaska since the first competition in 1970: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the dedicated athletes, coaches, 
        volunteers, leaders, and staff who contribute to the mission 
        and success of the 2014 Arctic Winter Games;
            (2) welcomes the return of the Arctic Winter Games to 
        Fairbanks, Alaska, for the first time since 1988; and
            (3) celebrates the continuing friendly competition among 
        northern circumpolar countries and the great cultural exchange 
        that keeps northern traditions alive.
                                 <all>
