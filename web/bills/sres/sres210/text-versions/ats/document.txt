Whereas Robert S. Mueller, III has enjoyed a long and distinguished career in

        during the Vietnam War, leading a rifle platoon of the 3rd Marine 
        Division and earning the Bronze Star, 2 Navy Commendation Medals, the 
        Purple Heart, and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry;
Whereas Director Mueller began his career in law enforcement in 1976 as an 
        Assistant United States Attorney in the United States Attorney's Office 
        for the Northern District of California in San Francisco, and then 
        served as an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of 
        Massachusetts in Boston;
Whereas Director Mueller later served in a variety of other positions in the 
        Department of Justice, including as a senior litigator in the Homicide

        Columbia, assistant to Attorney General Richard L. Thornburgh, and 
        Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division;

        and confirmed by the Senate to be the United States Attorney for the

        primary focus on national security threats;

        agreeing to serve for an additional 2 years beyond his original 10-year 
        term as Director of the FBI;

        that enabled Director Mueller to continue serving as Director of the 
        FBI;

        parties as a result of his candor, integrity, and unwavering commitment 
        to the rule of law; and

        principles of fidelity, bravery, and integrity that are at the core of 
        the FBI: Now, therefore, be it

        Robert S. Mueller, III as the sixth Director of the Federal
