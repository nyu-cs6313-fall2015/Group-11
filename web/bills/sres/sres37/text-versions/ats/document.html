Expressing the sense of the Senate in disapproving the proposal of the 
International Olympic Committee Executive Board to eliminate wrestling 
            from the Summer Olympic Games beginning in 2020.

Whereas wrestling is recognized as one of the world's oldest competitive sports 
        dating back to 3000 BC;
Whereas wrestling was one of the original sports of the ancient Greek Olympic 
        Games and of the first modern Olympic Games;
Whereas wrestling is one of the world's most diverse sports, with participants 
        from almost 200 countries around the world;
Whereas over 280,000 high school students in the United States participated in 
        wrestling in 2012;
Whereas there are over 300 intercollegiate wrestling programs in the United 
        States;
Whereas wrestling represents the determination and hard work it takes to succeed 
        in life and sport;
Whereas the United States has a long, proud, and storied Olympic wrestling 
        history; and
Whereas wrestling epitomizes the spirit of the Olympic Games: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) thanks the United States Olympic Committee for its 
        continued support of wrestling and encourages it to work 
        actively to reverse the proposal of the International Olympic 
        Committee Executive Board to eliminate wrestling from the 
        Summer Olympic Games beginning in 2020;
            (2) disapproves the proposal of the International Olympic 
        Committee Executive Board to eliminate wrestling from the 
        Summer Olympic Games beginning in 2020; and
            (3) urges the International Olympic Committee Executive 
        Board to reinstate wrestling as a core sport of the Summer 
        Olympic Games.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
