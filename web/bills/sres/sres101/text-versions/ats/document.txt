                               RESOLUTION


 
     Condemning the horrific attacks in Boston, Massachusetts, and 
 expressing support, sympathy, and prayers for those impacted by this 
                                tragedy.

Whereas the two bombings that occurred on Patriots' Day, April 15, 2013, during 
        the running of the 117th Boston Marathon, represent a terrible tragedy 
        and horrific act of terrorism against the United States;
Whereas the people of the United States mourn those who lost their lives or were 
        wounded;
Whereas police officers, firefighters, members of the National Guard, emergency 
        medical personnel, and other first responders acted heroically in 
        responding to the attacks, preventing additional loss of life;
Whereas the full resources of the Federal Government and State and local 
        governments are being brought to bear to investigate this attack and 
        bring the perpetrator or perpetrators to justice;
Whereas the residents of Massachusetts are a resilient people and will recover 
        from this tragedy; and
Whereas the people of the United States will always remember the victims of the 
        previous acts of terrorism that have occurred in the United States and 
        will always stand together as one people: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns the senseless attack in Boston, Massachusetts, 
        on Monday, April 15, 2013;
            (2) offers sympathy and condolences to the victims' 
        families;
            (3) sends thoughts and prayers for those who are recovering 
        from injuries;
            (4) honors the heroic efforts of the medical personnel who 
        are tirelessly providing care for the victims of this horrific 
        act of violence;
            (5) admires the courage of the first responders and the 
        many citizen heroes who aided the injured and tended to the 
        community;
            (6) commits to providing all necessary resources to law 
        enforcement officials who are investigating the terrorist 
        attacks;
            (7) remains committed to working together as united 
        Americans to bring those responsible for this attack to 
        justice; and
            (8) recognizes that the city of Boston, the people of 
        Massachusetts, and all Americans will rise up from this tragedy 
        and stand together as patriots.
