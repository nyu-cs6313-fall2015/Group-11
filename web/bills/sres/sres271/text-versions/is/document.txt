                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing the sense of the Senate that United States military 
 assistance for Cambodia should be suspended until an independent and 
  credible investigation occurs into the July 28, 2013, parliamentary 
elections, and election reforms are being implemented by the Government 
                              of Cambodia.

Whereas independent domestic and international organizations have raised serious 
        concerns regarding the integrity of the parliamentary elections held in 
        Cambodia on July 28, 2013;
Whereas, according to Human Rights Watch, ``the Cambodian government-controlled 
        National Election Committee (NEC) has failed to address credible 
        allegations of voter fraud and other irregularities or systematic 
        unfairness in the election process'';
Whereas opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) leader Sam Rainsy noted 
        in an October 7, 2013, Cambodia Daily op-ed article that the inaugural 
        meeting of the newly formed government was boycotted by 55 CNRP-elected 
        parliamentarians as a result of the refusal of the ruling Cambodian 
        People's Party to address ``shocking election irregularities'' that 
        allegedly denied CNRP additional parliamentary seats;
Whereas United Nations' Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Cambodia Surya P. 
        Subedi noted that ``it is critical for the new National Assembly to be 
        represented by the two key parties, for the National Assembly to be 
        truly representative of the whole of the Cambodian people and for it to 
        be concluded that the right to vote was effectively exercised on 28 
        July'';
Whereas in a September 23, 2013, statement, the United States Embassy in Phnom 
        Penh, Cambodia, called for ``a transparent review of irregularities in 
        the July 28 national elections which would help efforts to assess and 
        address flaws in the electoral process and give the Cambodian people 
        greater confidence in the electoral system'';
Whereas the CNRP boycott calls into question the legitimacy of the Cambodian 
        National Assembly and government; and
Whereas the policy of the Administration of a strategic rebalance toward the 
        Asia Pacific Region should include support for democracy, human rights, 
        and justice in Cambodia: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the United States 
should suspend military assistance for Cambodia until--
            (1) an independent and credible investigation occurs into 
        the July 28, 2013, parliamentary elections in Cambodia, and any 
        recommendations arising out of such investigation are fully 
        implemented; and
            (2) the Government of Cambodia, in consultation with civil 
        society and political parties in Cambodia, is implementing 
        election reforms to prevent incidents of fraud and abuse in 
        subsequent national and local elections in Cambodia.
