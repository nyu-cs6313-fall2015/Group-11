Recognizing Nobel Laureates Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai for 
  their efforts to end the financial exploitation of children and to 
           ensure the right of all children to an education.

Whereas, on October 10, 2014, the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the 2014 
        Nobel Peace Prize to Kailash Satyarthi and Malala Yousafzai;
Whereas the International Labour Organization estimates that, worldwide, 
        168,000,000 children are exploited financially, with 85,000,000 children 
        working in very hazardous environments and deprived of an education;
Whereas the United Nations Children's Fund estimates that 101,000,000 children 
        are not in school;
Whereas Kailash Satyarthi and his organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, have 
        rescued more than 82,000 children from the worst forms of child labor;
Whereas Malala Yousafzai has promoted education for girls in Pakistan since she 
        was 11 years old and is an advocate for worldwide access to education;
Whereas Kailash Satyarthi has endured threats on his life as a result of such 
        rescue efforts; and
Whereas the Taliban attempted to kill Malala Yousafzai on October 9, 2012, as a 
        result of her efforts to encourage more girls to attend school: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes Nobel Laureates Kailash Satyarthi and Malala 
        Yousafzai as symbols of peace and advocates for ending the 
        financial exploitation of children and for the opportunity of 
        all children to have access to education;
            (2) commends all individuals working around the world to 
        end the scourge of child slavery and to advance education for 
        all children;
            (3) recognizes the challenges that remain in ending the 
        financial exploitation of children and providing access to an 
        education for all children;
            (4) urges all governments, civil society organizations, 
        businesses, and individuals to unite in the common purpose of 
        protecting children from losing their childhoods as well as 
        their futures; and
            (5) recognizes the dedication and commitment to freedom, 
        the rights of children, and the endurance of the human spirit, 
        demonstrated by all individuals who make sacrifices to build a 
        more peaceful world.
