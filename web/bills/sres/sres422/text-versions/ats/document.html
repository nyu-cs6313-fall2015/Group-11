                               RESOLUTION


 
To authorize written testimony, document production, and representation 
 in Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Foundation, Inc. v. United States.

Whereas, in the case of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Foundation, Inc. v. 
        United States, No. 09-568 C, pending in the United States Court of 
        Federal Claims, the plaintiff has issued a subpoena for testimony and 
        production of documents from Holly Luck, a former employee of Senator 
        Baucus;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent current and former employees of the 
        Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony 
        relating to their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Holly Luck is authorized to provide written 
testimony and produce documents in the case of Montana Fish, Wildlife 
and Parks Foundation, Inc. v. United States, except concerning matters 
for which a privilege should be asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent Holly 
Luck in connection with the written testimony and document production 
authorized by section 1 of this resolution.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
