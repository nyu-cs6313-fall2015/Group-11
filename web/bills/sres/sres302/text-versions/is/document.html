                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           November 20, 2013

 Mr. Isakson (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Pryor, and Ms. Collins) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
                            on the Judiciary

                               RESOLUTION


 
        Designating December 1, 2013, as ``Drive Safer Sunday''.

Whereas motor vehicle travel is the primary means of transportation in the 
        United States;
Whereas every individual traveling on the roads and highways needs to drive in a 
        safer manner to reduce deaths and injuries that result from motor 
        vehicle accidents;
Whereas, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 
        wearing a seat belt saves as many as 15,000 lives each year;
Whereas the Senate wants all people of the United States to understand the life-
        saving importance of wearing a seat belt and encourages motorists to 
        drive safely, not just during the holiday season, but every time they 
        get behind the wheel; and
Whereas the Sunday after Thanksgiving is the busiest highway traffic day of the 
        year: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) encourages--
                    (A) high schools, colleges, universities, 
                administrators, teachers, primary schools, and 
                secondary schools to launch campus-wide educational 
                campaigns to urge students to focus on safety when 
                driving;
                    (B) national trucking firms to alert their drivers 
                to be especially focused on driving safely on the 
                Sunday after Thanksgiving, and to publicize the 
                importance of the day through use of the Citizens Band 
                Radio Service and at truck stops across the United 
                States;
                    (C) clergies to remind their congregations to 
                travel safely when attending services and gatherings;
                    (D) law enforcement personnel to remind drivers and 
                passengers to drive safely, particularly on the Sunday 
                after Thanksgiving; and
                    (E) all people of the United States to use the 
                Sunday after Thanksgiving as an opportunity to educate 
                themselves about highway safety; and
            (2) designates December 1, 2013, as ``Drive Safer Sunday''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
