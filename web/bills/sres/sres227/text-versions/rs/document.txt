To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the heroic rescue of Danish Jews 
           during the Second World War by the Danish people.

Whereas, in the fall of 1943, the Nazis occupied Denmark and issued orders that 
        the Danes deport all Danish Jews to concentration camps where the Jews 
        would eventually be exterminated;
Whereas the Danish people, as a result of the Nazi mandate, refused to accept 
        the prosecution of the Jews and began a mission of mercy on October 1, 
        1943, smuggling Jews across the Oresund Strait to neutral Sweden via 
        small boats and fishing cutters;
Whereas the Danish rescuers unselfishly risked their own lives, avoiding German 
        patrols for weeks during the rescue operations;
Whereas approximately 90 percent of the Danish Jews were saved from certain 
        death at the hands of the Nazis by the sheer courage and compassion 
        demonstrated by the Danes; and
Whereas it is imperative that future generations continue to remember and 
        understand what happened so that the horrors of the Holocaust will never 
        be repeated: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes and commemorates the bravery and valor of 
        those Danes who participated in the 1943 rescue operations that 
        saved the lives of 7,300 Jews who would otherwise have perished 
        in Nazi concentration camps; and
            (2) declares that the world owes a great debt to these 
        Danes who did not turn a blind eye on the dangers that faced 
        Jews under Nazi occupation and continue to serve as inspiration 
        to others in times of difficulties and challenges.
