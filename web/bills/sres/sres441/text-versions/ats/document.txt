                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating the week of May 1 through May 7, 2014, as ``National 
                  Physical Education and Sport Week''.

Whereas according to the 2012 Shape of the Nation Report, there has been a 
        dramatic increase in obesity in the United States over the last 20 
        years, and obesity rates are high;
Whereas over 30 percent of children in the United States are overweight or 
        obese;
Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 48 
        percent of high school students do not attend physical education classes 
        in an average week;
Whereas according to Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity 
        Guidelines for Americans, children and adolescents between the ages of 6 
        and 17 should engage in 60 minutes or more of physical activity daily, 
        including aerobic, muscle strengthening, and bone strengthening 
        exercises;
Whereas regular physical activity is necessary to support normal and healthy 
        growth in children and is essential to the continued health and well-
        being of children; and
Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to increase physical activity and 
        participation of children and youth in sports: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of May 1 through May 7, 2014, as 
        ``National Physical Education and Sport Week'';
            (2) recognizes National Physical Education and Sport Week 
        and the central role of physical education and sports in 
        creating a healthy lifestyle for all children and youth;
            (3) supports the implementation of local school wellness 
        policies (as that term is described in section 9A of the 
        Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758b)) 
        that include ambitious goals for physical education, physical 
        activity, and other activities that address the childhood 
        obesity epidemic and promote child wellness; and
            (4) encourages schools to offer physical education classes 
        to students and work with community partners to provide 
        opportunities and safe spaces for physical activities before 
        and after school and during the summer months for all children 
        and youth.
