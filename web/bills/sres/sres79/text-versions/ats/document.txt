                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work 
                                  Day.

Whereas the Take Our Daughters To Work Day program was created in New York City 
        as a response to research that showed that, by the 8th grade, many girls 
        were dropping out of school, had low self-esteem, and lacked confidence;
Whereas, in 2003, the name of the program was changed to ``Take Our Daughters 
        and Sons To Work Day'' so that boys who face many of the same challenges 
        as girls could also be involved in the program;
Whereas the mission of the program, to develop ``innovative strategies that 
        empower girls and boys to overcome societal barriers to reach their full 
        potential'', now fully reflects the addition of boys;
Whereas the Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work Foundation, a nonprofit 
        organization, has grown to become one of the largest public awareness 
        campaigns, with more than 37,400,000 participants annually in more than 
        3,000,000 organizations and workplaces in every State;
Whereas, in 2007, the Take Our Daughters To Work program transitioned to 
        Elizabeth City, North Carolina, became known as the Take Our Daughters 
        and Sons To Work Foundation, and received national recognition for the 
        dedication of the Foundation to future generations;
Whereas every year, mayors, governors, and other private and public officials 
        sign proclamations and lend their support to Take Our Daughters and Sons 
        To Work;
Whereas the fame of the Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work program has spread 
        overseas, with requests and inquiries being made from around the world 
        on how to operate the program;
Whereas 2012 marked the 20th anniversary of the Take Our Daughters and Sons To 
        Work program;
Whereas Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day will be observed on Thursday, 
        April 25, 2013; and
Whereas Take Our Daughters and Sons To Work is intended to continue helping 
        millions of girls and boys on an annual basis through experienced 
        activities and events to examine their opportunities and strive to reach 
        their fullest potential: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the goals of introducing our daughters and 
        sons to the workplace; and
            (2) commends all the participants in Take Our Daughters and 
        Sons To Work for their ongoing contributions to education, and 
        for the vital role the participants play in promoting and 
        ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the United States.
