Whereas the United States will convene the first U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit from 
        August 4 through August 6, 2014, featuring a congressional reception 
        welcoming African heads of state, the U.S.-Africa Business Forum, the 
        African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum, and dialogue sessions 
        between African leaders and President Barack Obama on investing in 
        Africa's future, promoting peace and regional stability, and governing 
        for the next generation;
Whereas the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit will be the largest event held between 
        the United States Government and African heads of state and governments;
Whereas the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit will build on the President's trip to 
        Africa in the summer of 2013 and will strengthen ties between the United 
        States and one of the most dynamic and fastest growing regions in the 
        world;
Whereas the United States Government has built strong and enduring partnerships 
        with African heads of state bilaterally and through the United Nations, 
        African Union, and African regional institutions;
Whereas the United States Government has demonstrated its commitment to Africa's 
        development and growth through resources, legislation, economic 
        relationships, and initiatives, including the African Growth and 
        Opportunity Act (19 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.), Power Africa, Feed the Future, 
        Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts, and other efforts led by the 
        Department of State, the United States Agency for International 
        Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Department 
        of Commerce, and other agencies of the United States Government;
Whereas there are 10 authorized United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa 
        with over 94,000 United Nations peacekeepers working to promote peace 
        and stability for over 131,000,000 people across the continent, in 
        addition to additional missions led by the African Union, with United 
        States and international support and training;
Whereas the United States has served as the global leader in investments and 
        innovations in health across Africa, contributing significant resources 
        to improvements in health over the past two decades through United 
        States-led programs such as the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS 
        Relief (PEPFAR), the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), and the 
        Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI);
Whereas, through its investments in health across 16 priority countries in 
        Africa over the last two decades, the United States Government has 
        contributed to the reduction of child mortality rates by 44 percent and 
        the reduction of maternal mortality rates by 39 percent;
Whereas the majority of the fastest growing economies in the world are in 
        Africa, and the continent's steady annual economic growth rate of 5 
        percent has exceeded that of other regions in the world;
Whereas there are currently 1,000,000,000 Africans representing the fastest 
        growing population in the world, and by 2035, the African continent will 
        have the world's largest workforce;
Whereas individual nations in Africa and the African Union have made significant 
        achievements and remarkable progress since the inception of the African 
        Union 51 years ago and its transition from the Organization of African 
        Unity;
Whereas the United States Government, recognizing the importance of Africa's 
        youth and future generations, has invested in the next generation of 
        African entrepreneurs, educators, civic leaders, and innovators, 
        including through the United States-led Young African Leaders Initiative 
        (YALI), helping them develop skills and networks to build brighter 
        futures for their communities and countries; and
Whereas the United States Government is looking forward to hosting 50 heads of 
        state and the Chair of the African Union at the U.S.-Africa Leaders 
        Summit to demonstrate the United States commitment to Africa, deepen 
        partnerships, and determine concrete ways that the United States can 
        support African-led efforts to further peace and regional security, 
        advance democracy and good governance, improve health and education 
        services, increase trade and investment, address environmental issues, 
        improve resilience and food security, combat wildlife trafficking, 
        invest in women, and support the next generation of African leaders: 
        Now, therefore, be it
