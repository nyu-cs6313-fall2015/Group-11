                               RESOLUTION


 
   Designating June 19, 2014, as ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' in 
recognition of June 19, 1865, the day on which slavery legally came to 
                      an end in the United States.

Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach the frontier areas of the 
        United States, in particular the State of Texas and other Southwestern 
        States, until months after the conclusion of the Civil War, more than 
        2\1/2\ years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation 
        was issued on January 1, 1863;
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, 
        arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and 
        that the enslaved were free;
Whereas African-Americans who had been slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 
        19, commonly known as ``Juneteenth Independence Day'', as inspiration 
        and encouragement for future generations;
Whereas African-Americans from the Southwest, for nearly 150 years, have 
        continued the tradition of observing ``Juneteenth Independence Day'';
Whereas 43 States, the District of Columbia, and other countries, have 
        designated ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' as a special day of 
        observance in recognition of the emancipation of all slaves in the 
        United States;
Whereas ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' celebrations have been held to honor 
        African-American freedom while encouraging self-development and respect 
        for all cultures;
Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by former slaves and 
        their descendants remain an example for all people of the United States, 
        regardless of background, religion, or race;
Whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the ratification of the 
        13&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; Amendment to the United States Constitution in January 
        1865;
Whereas Frederick Douglass, born in the State of Maryland in 1818, escaped from 
        slavery and became a leading writer, orator, publisher, and one of the 
        United States' most influential advocates for abolitionism and the 
        equality of all people;
Whereas Frederick Douglass was recognized for his accomplishments with a statue 
        that was unveiled during a ceremony on June 19, 2013, in Emancipation 
        Hall of the United States Capitol;
Whereas 2014 marks the 50&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; anniversary of the passage of the Civil 
        Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.), signed into law on July 2, 
        1964, a milestone in providing equal protections for African-Americans, 
        including former slaves and their descendants; and
Whereas, over the course of its history, the United States has grown into a 
        symbol of democracy and freedom around the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates June 19, 2014, as ``Juneteenth Independence 
        Day'';
            (2) recognizes the historical significance of ``Juneteenth 
        Independence Day'' to the United States;
            (3) supports the continued nationwide celebration of 
        ``Juneteenth Independence Day'' to provide an opportunity for 
        the people of the United States to learn more about the past 
        and to better understand the experiences that have shaped the 
        United States; and
            (4) recognizes that the observance of the end of slavery is 
        a part of the history and heritage of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
