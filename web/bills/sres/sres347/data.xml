  <summary>2/6/2014--Introduced.
Declares that it is U.S. policy: (1) that, in coordination with the government of Afghanistan, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member countries, and other allies in Afghanistan, the President shall complete the accelerated transition of U.S. military and security operations to such government and redeploy U.S. Armed Forces from Afghanistan by December 31, 2014; and (2) to pursue diplomatic efforts leading to a political settlement and reconciliation of the internal conflict in Afghanistan.

Expresses the sense of the Senate that, should the President determine the necessity to maintain U.S. troops in Afghanistan to carry out missions after December 31, 2014, any such presence and missions should be authorized by a separate vote of Congress not later than June 1, 2014.</summary>
