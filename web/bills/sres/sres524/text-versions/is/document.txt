                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding global climate change.

Whereas the 2014 National Climate Assessment stated ``The most recent decade was 
        the nation's warmest on record. U.S. temperatures are expected to 
        continue to rise.'';
Whereas the 2014 National Climate Assessment was drafted by over 300 authors and 
        extensively reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences and a Federal 
        Advisory Committee of 60 members;
Whereas the United States Global Change Research Program found that ``[i]n the 
        United States, climate change has already resulted in more frequent heat 
        waves, extreme precipitation, wildfires, and water scarcity'';
Whereas the United States Global Change Research Program coordinates and 
        integrates global change research across 13 Government agencies 
        including the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the 
        Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of 
        Commerce, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of 
        the Interior, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental 
        Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
        the National Science Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, and the 
        United States Agency for International Development;
Whereas the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review of the Department of Defense of the 
        United States stated ``The pressures caused by climate change will 
        influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on 
        economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world.''; 
        and
Whereas a Defense Science Board report concluded that ``[c]limate change will 
        only grow in concern for the United States and its security interests'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that global climate 
change is occurring and will continue to pose ongoing risks and 
challenges to the people and the Government of the United States.
                                 <all>
