    Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that--
            (1) certain uses of electronic devices by Senators on the 
        floor of the Senate are necessary and proper in the conduct of 
        official Senate business, would not distract, interrupt, or 
        inconvenience the business of Members of the Senate, and should 
        therefore be permissible, including--
                    (A) delivering floor remarks from text displayed on 
                personal digital assistant devices and tablet 
                computers;
                    (B) reviewing and editing documents on personal 
                digital assistant devices and tablet computers while 
                seated or standing at a desk, except when the Senator 
                who wishes to use the device holds the floor or seeks 
                to be recognized; and
                    (C) sending email and other data communication 
                using personal digital assistant devices and tablet 
                computers while seated or standing at a desk, except 
                when the Senator who wishes to use the device holds the 
                floor or seeks to be recognized;
            (2) necessary and proper uses of electronic devices on the 
        floor of the Senate do not include--
                    (A) transmitting sound for any purpose other than 
                through earphones or in such a manner as would not 
                disturb proceedings on the floor of the Senate for the 
                purpose of assisting a person with a disability;
                    (B) using telephones or other devices for voice 
                communication; or
                    (C) using desktop computers, laptop computers, or 
                other large devices;
            (3) the Committee on Rules and Administration should 
        consider an amendment to the Rules for the Regulation of the 
        Senate Wing consistent with the principles stated above; and
            (4) any amendment to the Rules for the Regulation of the 
        Senate Wing should take into account possible future changes in 
        technology.
