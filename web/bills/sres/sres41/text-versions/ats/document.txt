                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           February 25, 2013

 Mr. Enzi (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Cardin) 
 submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the designation of March 2013, as National Colorectal 
                        Cancer Awareness Month.

Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men 
        and women in the United States, killing more non-smokers than any other 
        cancer;
Whereas every year it is estimated that more than 135,000 individuals in the 
        United States are diagnosed with colorectal cancer and more than 50,000 
        individuals die from the disease;
Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the most highly preventable forms of cancer 
        because screening tests can find polyps that can be removed before 
        becoming cancerous;
Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer early, when treatment works 
        best;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that if every 
        individual aged 50 or older had regular screening tests, as many as 60 
        percent of deaths from colorectal cancer could be prevented;
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with localized colorectal cancer 
        is 90 percent, but only 39 percent of all diagnoses occur at this stage;
Whereas colorectal cancer screening can effectively reduce colorectal cancer 
        incidence and mortality, yet 1 in 3 adults between the ages of 50 and 75 
        are not up to date with recommended colorectal cancer screening;
Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on colorectal cancer 
        prevention, screening, and symptoms are held during the month of March 
        each year; and
Whereas educational efforts can help provide information to the public of 
        methods of prevention and screening, as well as about symptoms for early 
        detection: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Colorectal 
        Cancer Awareness Month; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the month with appropriate awareness and educational 
        activities.
                                 <all>
