Recognizing National Native American Heritage Month and celebrating the 
  heritages and cultures of Native Americans and the contributions of 
                 Native Americans to the United States.

Whereas from November 1, 2014, through November 30, 2014, the United States 
        celebrates National Native American Heritage Month;
Whereas Native Americans are descendants of the original, indigenous inhabitants 
        of what is now the United States;
Whereas the Bureau of the Census estimated in 2010 that there were more than 
        5,000,000 individuals in the United States of Native American descent;
Whereas Native Americans maintain vibrant cultures and traditions and hold a 
        deeply rooted sense of community;
Whereas Native Americans have moving stories of tragedy, triumph, and 
        perseverance that need to be shared with future generations;
Whereas Native Americans speak and preserve indigenous languages, which have 
        contributed to the English language by being used as names of 
        individuals and locations throughout the United States;
Whereas Congress has consistently reaffirmed the support of the United States of 
        tribal self-governance and self-determination and the commitment of the 
        United States to improving the lives of all Native Americans by--

    (1) enhancing health care and law enforcement resources;

    (2) improving the housing and socioeconomic status of Native Americans; 
and

    (3) approving settlements of litigation involving Indian tribes and the 
United States;

Whereas the United States is committed to strengthening the government-to-
        government relationship that it has maintained with the various Indian 
        tribes;
Whereas Congress has recognized the contributions of the Iroquois Confederacy, 
        and the influence of the Confederacy on the Founding Fathers in the 
        drafting of the Constitution of the United States with the concepts of--

    (1) freedom of speech;

    (2) the separation of governmental powers; and

    (3) the system of checks and balances between the branches of 
government;

Whereas with the enactment of the Native American Heritage Day Act of 2009 
        (Public Law 111-33; 123 Stat. 1922), Congress--

    (1) reaffirmed the government-to-government relationship between the 
United States and Native American governments; and

    (2) recognized the important contributions of Native Americans to the 
culture of the United States;

Whereas Native Americans have made distinct and important contributions to the 
        United States and the rest of the world in many fields, including the 
        fields of agriculture, medicine, music, language, and art, and Native 
        Americans have distinguished themselves as inventors, entrepreneurs, 
        spiritual leaders, and scholars;
Whereas Native Americans have served with honor and distinction in the Armed 
        Forces, and continue to serve in the Armed Forces in greater numbers per 
        capita than any other group in the United States;
Whereas the United States has recognized the contribution of the Native American 
        code talkers in World War I and World War II, who used indigenous 
        languages as an unbreakable military code, saving countless lives in the 
        United States; and
Whereas the people of the United States have reason to honor the great 
        achievements and contributions of Native Americans and their ancestors: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the month of November 2014 as National 
        Native American Heritage Month;
            (2) recognizes the Friday after Thanksgiving as ``Native 
        American Heritage Day'' in accordance with the Native American 
        Heritage Day Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-33; 123 Stat. 1922); 
        and
            (3) urges the people of the United States to observe 
        National Native American Heritage Month and Native American 
        Heritage Day with appropriate programs and activities.
