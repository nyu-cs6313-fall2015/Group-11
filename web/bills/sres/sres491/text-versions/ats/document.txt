                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the Los Angeles Kings on winning the 2014 Stanley Cup 
                             Championship.

Whereas, on June 13, 2014, the Los Angeles Kings (referred to in this preamble 
        as the ``Kings'') defeated the New York Rangers by a score of 3 to 2 in 
        game 5 to win the 2014 Stanley Cup and be crowned champions of the 
        National Hockey League (referred to in this preamble as the ``NHL'');
Whereas defenseman Alex Martinez scored the Stanley Cup winning goal 14 minutes 
        and 43 seconds into double overtime in game 5;
Whereas the Kings are the first team to win the Stanley Cup twice in 3 seasons 
        since the Detroit Red Wings consecutively won the Stanley Cup in the 
        1997 and 1998 seasons;
Whereas the Kings became the first team in NHL history to win 3 series in the 
        seventh game on the road during the postseason;
Whereas the Kings have played 64 playoff games since 2012, the most in a 3 year 
        span in NHL history;
Whereas the Kings allowed only 168 goals during the regular 2013-2014 season, 
        the fewest of any NHL team, thus earning goaltender Jonathan Quick the 
        William M. Jennings trophy;
Whereas the Kings also survived 7 playoff games in which they could have been 
        eliminated but instead rallied from 2 goal deficits 4 times, including 
        the first 2 games of the Stanley Cup Finals against the New York 
        Rangers;
Whereas all players on the 2013-2014 Kings roster should be congratulated, 
        including Playoff Most Valuable Player Justin Williams and Team Captain 
        Dustin Brown, as well as, Jeff Carter, Kyle Clifford, Drew Doughty, 
        Marian Gaborik, Matt Greene, Martin Jones, Dwight King, Anze Kopitar, 
        Trevor Lewis, Alec Martinez, Brayden McNabb, Willie Mitchell, Jake 
        Muzzin, Jordan Nolan, Tanner Pearson, Jonathan Quick, Robyn Regehr, Mike 
        Richards, Jarret Stoll, Tyler Toffoli, and Slava Voynov; and
Whereas Team Owners Philip Anschutz and Edward Roski, General Manager Dean 
        Lombardi, and Head Coach Darryl Sutter assembled the powerful team that 
        comprises the 2014 Los Angeles Kings and led the team through a strong 
        season that culminated in the winning of the Stanley Cup Championship: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Los Angeles Kings on winning the 2014 
        Stanley Cup Championship; and
            (2) commends Los Angeles Kings fans in not only California, 
        but all across the United States for cheering the team to 
        victory.
                                 <all>
