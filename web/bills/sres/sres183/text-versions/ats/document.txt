                               RESOLUTION


 
Commemorating the relaunching of the 172-year-old Charles W. Morgan by 
           Mystic Seaport: The Museum of America and the Sea.

Whereas the Charles W. Morgan (referred to in this preamble as the ``Morgan'') 
        was built and launched from New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1841;
Whereas the Morgan is a National Historic Landmark vessel, the only remaining 
        wooden whaleship in the world, and the oldest commercial vessel in the 
        United States;
Whereas the Morgan and similar vessels were the economic backbone of New England 
        for 200 years;
Whereas the Morgan has served as a living artifact and a testament to the 
        ingenuity, risk, and entrepreneurship of the United States since the 
        vessel retired from the whaling industry in 1921;
Whereas the Morgan has completed a 5-year, multi-million dollar restoration at 
        the Preservation Shipyard of Mystic Seaport: The Museum of America and 
        the Sea and will be relaunched on July 21, 2013;
Whereas the Morgan will embark on a ceremonial 38th voyage in June 2014, serving 
        as ``Ambassador'' to the world's whales and to the world's whaling 
        heritage;
Whereas the 38th voyage of the Morgan will rekindle the spirit of exploration 
        and discovery of people throughout the world;
Whereas individuals and organizations from 22 States have contributed materials 
        and expertise to the restoration and 38th voyage of the Morgan; and
Whereas the new mission of the Morgan will be devoted to history, education, 
        science, and ocean awareness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates the relaunching of the whaleship Charles 
        W. Morgan and commends the staff, volunteers, and trustees of 
        Mystic Seaport: The Museum of America and the Sea for their 
        efforts to preserve and protect the maritime heritage of the 
        United States;
            (2) supports the plan of Mystic Seaport: The Museum of 
        America and the Sea to reinterpret the Charles W. Morgan as a 
        vessel of scientific and educational exploration whose cargo is 
        knowledge and whose mission is to promote awareness of the 
        maritime heritage of the United States and the conservation of 
        the species the Morgan hunted; and
            (3) recognizes the Charles W. Morgan as the ``Ambassador to 
        the Whales'', dedicated to advancing public understanding of 
        species conservation.
                                 <all>
