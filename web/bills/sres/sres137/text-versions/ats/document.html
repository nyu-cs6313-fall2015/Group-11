                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                              May 9, 2013

   Mr. Nelson (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Coons) 
 submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
           Designating May 2013 as ``Older Americans Month''.

Whereas President John F. Kennedy first designated May as ``Senior Citizens 
        Month'' in 1963;
Whereas, in 1963, only 17,000,000 living people in the United States had reached 
        their 65th birthday, approximately \1/3\ of older people in the United 
        States lived in poverty, and there were few programs to meet the needs 
        of older people in the United States;
Whereas, as of 2013, there are more than 41,000,000 people in the United States 
        who are 65 years of age or older;
Whereas, as of 2013, there are more than 9,000,000 veterans of the Armed Forces 
        who are 65 years of age or older;
Whereas older people in the United States rely on Federal programs such as 
        Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and, in the case of veterans, 
        TRICARE and the health care system of the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs, for financial security and high-quality, affordable health 
        care;
Whereas the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) provides 
        federally funded community-based social services and nutritional support 
        programs to nearly 2,600,000 older people in the United States each 
        year;
Whereas many people in the United States are living longer, working longer, and 
        enjoying healthier, more active lifestyles than in past generations;
Whereas older people play an important role by continuing to contribute 
        experience, knowledge, wisdom, and accomplishments;
Whereas older people are active community members involved in volunteering, 
        mentorship, arts and culture, and civic engagement; and
Whereas recognizing the successes of older people in the community encourages 
        ongoing participation and further accomplishments: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates May 2013 as ``Older Americans Month'';
            (2) recognizes May 2013 as the 50th anniversary of ``Older 
        Americans Month''; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to provide 
        opportunities for older people to continue to flourish by--
                    (A) emphasizing the importance of older people and 
                their leadership by publicly recognizing their 
                continued achievements;
                    (B) presenting opportunities for older people to 
                share their wisdom, experience, and skills; and
                    (C) recognizing older people as a valuable asset in 
                strengthening the communities of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
