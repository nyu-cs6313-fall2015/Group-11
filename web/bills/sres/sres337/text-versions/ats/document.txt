                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for the designation of January 28, 2014, as 
                     ``National Data Privacy Day''.

Whereas new and innovative technologies enhance our lives by increasing our 
        ability to communicate, learn, share, and produce;
Whereas integration of new and innovative technologies into our everyday lives 
        has the potential to compromise the privacy of individuals if 
        appropriate protection is not taken;
Whereas there is opportunity for governments, corporations, and civil society to 
        work together to protect the privacy of individuals;
Whereas many individuals and companies are not fully aware of the risks to the 
        privacy of individuals posed by new and innovative technologies, of data 
        protection and privacy laws, or of the specific steps they can take to 
        protect the privacy of individuals;
Whereas ``National Data Privacy Day'' constitutes a nationwide effort to educate 
        and raise awareness about respecting privacy, safeguarding data, and 
        enabling trust;
Whereas the annual recognition of ``National Data Privacy Day'' by Congress 
        would encourage more people nationwide to be aware of data privacy and 
        to take all necessary steps to prevent data loss and respect privacy;
Whereas government officials and agencies, as well as representatives of 
        businesses and nonprofit organizations, privacy professionals, academic 
        communities, legal scholars, educators, and others with an interest in 
        data privacy are working together on January 28, 2014, to educate and 
        raise awareness about data privacy and about protecting the privacy of 
        individuals;
Whereas on January 28, 2014, privacy professionals and educators are being 
        encouraged to discuss data privacy and security; and
Whereas January 28, 2014, would be an appropriate day to designate as ``National 
        Data Privacy Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of January 28, 2014, as 
        ``National Data Privacy Day'';
            (2) encourages State and local governments to observe the 
        day with appropriate activities and initiatives that raise 
        awareness about data privacy and security;
            (3) encourages privacy professionals and educators to 
        discuss data privacy and security;
            (4) encourages corporations, governments, and other 
        relevant organizations to take steps to protect the privacy and 
        security of individuals and to promote trust in technologies;
            (5) encourages individuals across the United States to 
        learn about data privacy and the specific steps they can take 
        to protect the privacy of information they possess about 
        themselves and others; and
            (6) encourages everyone to respect privacy, safeguard data 
        they possess, and enable trust.
