                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the goals and ideals of ``National Donate Life 
                                Month''.

Whereas in March 2014, over 118,800 individuals were on the official waiting 
        list for organ donation managed by the Organ Procurement and 
        Transplantation Network;
Whereas in 2013, 31,422 organs from 14,257 donors (including both living and 
        deceased donors) were transplanted into 28,952 patients, yet 6,123 
        candidates for transplantation died while waiting for an organ 
        transplant;
Whereas on average, 18 people die every day of every year while waiting for an 
        organ donation;
Whereas over 100,000,000 people in the United States are registered to be organ 
        and tissue donors, yet the demand for donated organs still outweighs the 
        supply of organs made available each day;
Whereas many people do not know about their options for organ and tissue 
        donation, or have not made their wishes clear to their families;
Whereas organ and tissue donation can give meaning to the tragic loss of a loved 
        one by enabling up to 8 people to receive the gift of life from a single 
        deceased donor;
Whereas living donors can donate a kidney or a portion of a lung or liver to 
        save the life of another individual; and
Whereas April is traditionally recognized as ``National Donate Life Month'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Donate Life 
        Month'';
            (2) supports promoting awareness of organ donation;
            (3) encourages States, localities, and the territories and 
        possessions of the United States to support the goals and 
        ideals of National Donate Life Month by issuing proclamations 
        designating April 2014 as National Donate Life Month;
            (4) commends the generous gift of life provided by 
        individuals who indicate their wish to become organ donors;
            (5) acknowledges the grief of families facing the loss of a 
        loved one and commends those families who, in their grief, 
        choose to donate the organs of their deceased family member;
            (6) recognizes the generous contribution made by each 
        living individual who has donated an organ to save a life;
            (7) acknowledges the advances in medical technology that 
        have enabled organ transplantation with organs donated by 
        living individuals to become a viable treatment option for an 
        increasing number of patients;
            (8) commends the medical professionals and organ 
        transplantation experts who have worked to improve the process 
        of living organ donation and increase the number of living 
        donors; and
            (9) salutes all individuals who have helped to give the 
        gift of life by supporting, promoting, and encouraging organ 
        donation.
                                 <all>
