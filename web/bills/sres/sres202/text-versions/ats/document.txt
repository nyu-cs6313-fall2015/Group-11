                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating July 30, 2013, as ``National Whistleblower Appreciation 
                                 Day''.

Whereas, in 1777, before the passage of the Bill of Rights, 10 sailors and 
        marines blew the whistle on fraud and misconduct harmful to the United 
        States;
Whereas the Founding Fathers unanimously supported the whistleblowers in words 
        and deeds, including releasing government records and providing monetary 
        assistance for reasonable legal expenses necessary to prevent 
        retaliation;
Whereas, on July 30, 1778, in demonstration of their full support for 
        whistleblowers, the members of the Continental Congress unanimously 
        enacted the first whistleblower legislation in the United States that 
        read: ``Resolved, That it is the duty of all persons in the service of 
        the United States, as well as all other the inhabitants thereof, to give 
        the earliest information to Congress or other proper authority of any 
        misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons 
        in the service of these states, which may come to their knowledge'' 
        (legislation of July 30, 1778, reprinted in Journals of the Continental 
        Congress, 1774-1789, ed. Government Printing Office (Washington, D.C., 
        1908), 11:732);
Whereas whistleblowers risk their careers, jobs, and reputations by reporting 
        waste, fraud, and abuse to the proper authorities;
Whereas, when providing proper authorities with lawful disclosures, 
        whistleblowers save taxpayers in the United States billions of dollars 
        each year and serve the public interest by ensuring that the United 
        States remains an ethical and safe place; and
Whereas it is the public policy of the United States to encourage, in accordance 
        with Federal law (including the Constitution, rules, and regulations) 
        and consistent with the protection of classified information (including 
        sources and methods of detection), honest and good faith reporting of 
        misconduct, fraud, misdemeanors, and other crimes to the appropriate 
        authority at the earliest time possible: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates July 30, 2013, as ``National Whistleblower 
        Appreciation Day''; and
            (2) ensures that the Federal Government implements the 
        intent of the Founding Fathers, as reflected in the legislation 
        enacted on July 30, 1778, by encouraging each executive agency 
        to recognize National Whistleblower Appreciation Day by--
                    (A) informing employees, contractors working on 
                behalf of United States taxpayers, and members of the 
                public about the legal rights of citizens of the United 
                States to blow the whistle; and
                    (B) acknowledging the contributions of 
                whistleblowers to combating waste, fraud, abuse, and 
                violations of laws and regulations in the United 
                States.
                                 <all>
