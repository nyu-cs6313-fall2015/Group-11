                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate with respect to the tragic shooting 
at Los Angeles International Airport on November 1, 2013, of employees 
             of the Transportation Security Administration.

Whereas on November 1, 2013, a gunman entered Terminal 3 of the Los Angeles 
        International Airport and opened fire at a security checkpoint, 
        targeting the Transportation Security Officers who are charged with 
        protecting our aviation system and the people of the United States;
Whereas Gerardo Hernandez, a 39-year-old resident of Porter Ranch, California, a 
        beloved husband and father of two, lost his life in the shooting and 
        tragically became the first Transportation Security Officer to be killed 
        in the performance of his duties;
Whereas James Speer and Tony Grigsby, dedicated Transportation Security Officers 
        and colleagues of the deceased officer, were wounded in the attack;
Whereas a member of the traveling public, Brian Ludmer, a 29-year-old high 
        school teacher from Lake Forest, Illinois, was also injured; and
Whereas Transportation Security Officers, law enforcement personnel, first 
        responders, and medical professionals acted courageously to subdue the 
        gunman, secure the airport, help move passengers out of harm's way, and 
        treat victims of the attack:
Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) strongly condemns the senseless and appalling act of 
        violence carried out at Los Angeles International Airport on 
        November 1, 2013;
            (2) offers its deepest condolences to the family, friends, 
        and loved ones of Gerardo Hernandez;
            (3) honors the dedicated public service of Gerardo 
        Hernandez, James Speer, and Tony Grigsby;
            (4) sends its hope for a quick recovery to the other 
        victims of the horrific attack; and
            (5) remains committed to preventing similar tragedies from 
        happening again.
                                 <all>
