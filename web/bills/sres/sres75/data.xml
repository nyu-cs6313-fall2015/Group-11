  <summary>12/20/2013--Passed Senate amended.
(This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the Senate on December 18, 2013. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Condemns Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights.

 Calls on Iran to release the 7 imprisoned leaders, the 12 imprisoned educators, and all other prisoners held solely on account of their religion.

Calls on the President and Secretary of State, in cooperation with responsible nations, to condemn Iran's continued violation of human rights and demand the release of prisoners held solely on account of their religion.

Urges the President and Secretary to utilize all available authorities, including the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, to impose sanctions on Iranian government officials and other individuals directly responsible for serious human rights abuses, including abuses against the Baha'i community of Iran.</summary>
