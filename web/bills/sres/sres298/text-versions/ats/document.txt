                               RESOLUTION


 
To authorize testimony, documents, and representation in United States 
                               v. Allen.

Whereas, in the case of United States v. Allen, Crim. No. 12-112, pending in the 
        United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, the 
        prosecution has requested the production of documents and testimony from 
        current and former employees of the offices of Senators Bill Nelson and 
        Marco Rubio;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent current and former employees of the 
        Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony 
        relating to their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Peter Mitchell and Grace Pettus, a current and a 
former employee, respectively, of the Office of Senator Bill Nelson, 
and Adele Griffin and Ashley Cook, current employees of the Office of 
Senator Marco Rubio, and any other current or former employee from 
either office from whom relevant evidence may be sought, are authorized 
to produce documents and provide testimony in the case of United States 
v. Allen, except concerning matters for which a privilege should be 
asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
current and former employees of the offices of Senators Nelson and 
Rubio in connection with the production of evidence authorized in 
section one of this resolution.
                                 <all>
