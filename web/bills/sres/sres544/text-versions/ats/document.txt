                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating the year of 2014 as the ``International Year of Family 
                               Farming''.

Whereas United Nations Resolution A/Res/66/222, adopted by the General Assembly 
        on December 22, 2011, designates the year 2014 as the ``International 
        Year of Family Farming'';
Whereas the International Year of Family Farming recognizes the important 
        contribution of family farming in food security and eradicating poverty 
        around the world;
Whereas in the United States, family farms constitute 96 percent of all farms;
Whereas the agriculture sector contributes more than $130,000,000,000 to the 
        United States economy, employs approximately 14 percent of the total 
        workforce in the United States, and accounts for nearly 5 percent of the 
        United States gross domestic product;
Whereas 45 percent of individuals around the world make a living directly by 
        farming;
Whereas family farming is the predominant form of agriculture in both developing 
        and developed countries;
Whereas family farming serves as a means of organizing agricultural, forestry, 
        fishery, pastoral, and aquaculture production;
Whereas family farming plays important socioeconomic, environmental, and 
        cultural roles;
Whereas family farmers grow high-quality food, are active participants in civil 
        society, and are stewards of the land;
Whereas 75 percent of the poorest individuals around the world live in rural 
        areas;
Whereas family farms are linked to most areas of rural development and have 
        invested significantly in local communities;
Whereas the majority of farmers around the world are women who produce up to 80 
        percent of food around the world; and
Whereas 870,000,000 individuals are suffering from chronic undernourishment and 
        a disproportionate number of such individuals are farmers: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the year 2014 as the ``International Year of 
        Family Farming'';
            (2) congratulates family farmers in the United States and 
        around the world;
            (3) recognizes the vital role family farms play in the 
        economic and social well-being of the United States and the 
        world;
            (4) recognizes the importance of raising the profile of 
        family farming by focusing the attention of individuals around 
        the world on the significant role of family farming in 
        alleviating hunger and poverty, providing food security and 
        nutrition, improving livelihoods, managing natural resources, 
        protecting the environment, and achieving sustainable 
        development in rural areas;
            (5) encourages countries, national organizations, and 
        States to undertake activities to support the International 
        Year of Family Farming;
            (6) recognizes the role and importance of women in family 
        farming;
            (7) emphasizes the positive impact of family farms and 
        developing new programs for domestic and international family 
        agricultural development; and
            (8) advocates for the protection of the viability of family 
        farms, which serve as the foundation of rural society and 
        social stability.
