                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate that the United States should leave 
 no member of the Armed Forces unaccounted for during the drawdown of 
                         forces in Afghanistan.

Whereas the United States is a country of great honor and integrity;
Whereas the United States has made a sacred promise to members of the Armed 
        Forces who are deployed overseas in defense of this country that their 
        sacrifice and service will never be forgotten; and
Whereas the United States can never thank the proud members of the Armed Forces 
        enough for what they do for this country on a daily basis: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) believes that the United States should undertake every 
        reasonable effort--
                    (A) to find and repatriate members of the Armed 
                Forces who are missing; and
                    (B) to repatriate members of the Armed Forces who 
                are captured;
            (2) believes that the United States has a responsibility to 
        keep the promises made to members of the Armed Forces who risk 
        their lives on a daily basis on behalf of the people of the 
        United States;
            (3) supports the United States Soldier's Creed and the 
        Warrior Ethos, which state that ``I will never leave a fallen 
        comrade''; and
            (4) believes that, while the United States continues to 
        transition leadership roles in combat operations in Afghanistan 
        to the people of Afghanistan, the United States must continue 
        to fulfill these important promises to any member of the Armed 
        Forces who is in a missing status or captured as a result of 
        service in Afghanistan now or in the future.
                                 <all>
