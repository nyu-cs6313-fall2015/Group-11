		<whereas><text>Whereas in 2007, September 15 of each year was established by the United Nations as the
			 International Day of Democracy, a day set aside to review the state of
			 democracy in the world;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas democracy is a means of government that makes manifest the free exercise of certain
			 inalienable rights, among them being the freedom of assembly, the freedom
			 of association, the freedom of the press, and the freedom of speech;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas democracy allows for participatory governance, mobilizing citizens to strive for their
			 version of the good and instilling hope that the aspirations of the people
			 may one day be realized;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas an analysis of 84 independent studies shows that democracy has a favorable impact on the
			 formation of human capital, the rate of inflation, the level of economic
			 freedom, and the stability of political institutions;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas democracy promotes tolerance and respect by recognizing the human dignity of all people and
			 is necessary to the full realization of the values enshrined in the
			 Universal Declaration of Human Rights;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines <quote>civil society</quote> as associations around which society voluntarily organizes itself and which represent a wide range
			 of interests and ties, including community-based organizations, indigenous
			 peoples’ organizations, and non-government organizations (NGOs);</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a vibrant civil society is an essential element of democratic societies and plays a key
			 role in providing transparency, ensuring the legitimacy of elections,
			 advocating for marginalized groups, and making clear the will of the
			 people;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, since 2012, the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law has identified 69 new
			 restrictive measures in over 50 countries hindering the ability of
			 civil society organizations (CSOs) to freely operate;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas of the 98 countries for which data is available, research presented in a 2013 article for
			 the Journal of Democracy explains that 12 prohibit and 39 restrict foreign
			 funding of domestic NGOs;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in 2000, the Community of Democracies was founded <quote>to bring together governments, civil society, and the private sector in the pursuit of a common
			 goal: supporting democratic rules and strengthening democratic norms and
			 institutions around the world</quote>;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in 2011, the United States joined other like-minded governments to establish the <quote>Lifeline: Embattled Civil Society Organizations Fund</quote> to provide small grants to CSOs for immediate needs and to support short-term advocacy projects;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, through the Open Government Partnership, 63 countries have committed to protecting the
			 ability of CSOs to operate in a manner that is consistent with the rights
			 to freedom of expression, association, and opinion;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in September 2013, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, the United
			 States launched a coordinated multilateral effort encouraging countries to
			 stand with civil society and push back against growing restrictions on
			 CSOs;</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and
			 of Association stands on the front lines of civil society protection,
			 documenting extensive global threats to civil society and strengthening
			 international norms; and</text></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States remains committed to its stand with civil society by developing new
			 mechanisms to combat restrictions on civil society and bolster civil
			 society’s efforts to support democracy around the world:  
    Now, therefore, be it</text>
