                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             July 24, 2014

    Mr. Pryor (for himself and Mr. Boozman) submitted the following 
    resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating the week of October 12 through October 18, 2014, as 
    ``National Case Management Week'' to recognize the role of case 
       management in improving health care outcomes for patients.

Whereas case management is a collaborative process of assessment, education, 
        planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation, and advocacy;
Whereas the goal of case management is to meet the health needs of the patient 
        and the family of the patient, while respecting and assuring the right 
        of the patient to self-determination through communication and other 
        available resources in order to promote high-quality, cost-effective 
        outcomes;
Whereas case managers are advocates who help patients understand their current 
        health status, guide patients on ways to improve their health, and 
        provide cohesion with other professionals on the health care delivery 
        team;
Whereas the American Case Management Association and the Case Management Society 
        of America work diligently to raise awareness about the broad range of 
        services case managers offer and to educate providers, payers, 
        regulators, and consumers on the improved patient outcomes that case 
        management services can provide;
Whereas through National Case Management Week, the American Case Management 
        Association and the Case Management Society of America aim to continue 
        to educate providers, payers, regulators, and consumers about how vital 
        case managers are to the successful delivery of health care;
Whereas the American Case Management Association and the Case Management Society 
        of America will celebrate National Case Management Week during the week 
        of October 12 through October 18, 2014, in order to recognize case 
        managers as an essential link to patients receiving quality health care; 
        and
Whereas it is appropriate to recognize the many achievements of case managers in 
        improving health care outcomes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of October 12 through October 18, 
        2014, as ``National Case Management Week'';
            (2) recognizes the role of case management in providing 
        successful and cost-effective health care; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Case Management Week and learn about the field of case 
        management.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
