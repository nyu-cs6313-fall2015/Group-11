                               RESOLUTION


 
    To authorize document production and representation in Care One 
Management LLC, et al. v. United Healthcare Workers East, SEIU 1199, et 
                                  al.

Whereas, in the case of Care One Management LLC, et al. v. United Healthcare 
        Workers East, SEIU 1199, et al., No. 2:12-cv-06371, pending in the 
        United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, the 
        plaintiffs have issued a subpoena for testimony and production of 
        documents from Senator Richard Blumenthal;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent Members of the Senate with respect to 
        any subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to their official 
        responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Senator Blumenthal is authorized to provide 
documents in the case of Care One Management LLC, et al. v. United 
Healthcare Workers East, SEIU 1199, et al., except concerning matters 
for which a privilege or objection is asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
Senator Blumenthal in this matter.
                                 <all>
