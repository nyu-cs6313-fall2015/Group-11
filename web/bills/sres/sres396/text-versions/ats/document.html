                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 25, 2014

    Mr. Isakson (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating March 25, 2014, as ``National Cerebral Palsy Awareness 
                                 Day''.

Whereas the term ``cerebral palsy'' refers to a group of permanent disorders of 
        the development of movement and posture that are attributed to non-
        progressive disturbances that occur in the developing brain;
Whereas cerebral palsy, the most common motor disability in children, is caused 
        by damage to 1 or more specific areas of the developing brain, which 
        usually occurs during fetal development, before, during, or after birth;
Whereas the majority of children who have cerebral palsy are born with the 
        disorder, although cerebral palsy may remain undetected for months or 
        years;
Whereas individuals with cerebral palsy also have at least 1 co-occurring 
        condition, with 41 percent of such individuals having co-occurring 
        epilepsy and nearly 7 percent having co-occurring autism spectrum 
        disorder;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released information 
        indicating that cerebral palsy is not decreasing in prevalence and that 
        an estimated 1 in 323 children has cerebral palsy;
Whereas approximately 800,000 people in the United States are affected by 
        cerebral palsy;
Whereas although there is currently no cure for cerebral palsy, treatment often 
        improves the capabilities of a child with cerebral palsy;
Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful that breakthroughs in cerebral 
        palsy research will be forthcoming;
Whereas researchers across the United States are conducting important research 
        projects involving cerebral palsy; and
Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise awareness in the general 
        public and the medical community about cerebral palsy: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 25, 2014, as ``National Cerebral Palsy 
        Awareness Day'';
            (2) encourages all people of the United States to become 
        more informed and aware of cerebral palsy; and
            (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to 
        transmit a copy of this resolution to Reaching for the Stars: A 
        Foundation of Hope for Children with Cerebral Palsy.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
