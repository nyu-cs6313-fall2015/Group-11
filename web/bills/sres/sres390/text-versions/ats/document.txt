                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             March 13, 2014

    Mr. Merkley (for himself and Mr. Hatch) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
         Designating March 11, 2014, as ``World Plumbing Day''.

Whereas the plumbing industry plays an important role in safeguarding the public 
        health of the people of the United States and the world;
Whereas 780,000,000 people around the world do not have access to safe drinking 
        water;
Whereas 2,500,000,000 people around the world live without adequate sanitation 
        facilities;
Whereas the lack of water and sanitation is the largest barrier to childhood 
        survival, public health, education, and economic productivity;
Whereas in the developing world, 24,000 children under the age of 5 die every 
        day from preventable causes, such as diarrhea contracted from unclean 
        water;
Whereas safe and efficient plumbing saves money and reduces future water supply 
        costs and infrastructure costs;
Whereas the installation of modern plumbing systems must be accomplished in a 
        specific, safe manner by trained professionals in order to prevent 
        widespread disease, which can be crippling and deadly to the community;
Whereas the people of the United States rely on plumbing professionals to 
        maintain, repair, and rebuild the aging water infrastructure of the 
        United States;
Whereas Congress and plumbing professionals across the United States and the 
        world are committed to safeguarding public health; and
Whereas the founding organization of World Plumbing Day, the World Plumbing 
        Council, is actively supported by organizations in the United States 
        such as the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical 
        Officials: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate designates March 11, 2014, as ``World 
Plumbing Day''.
                                 <all>
