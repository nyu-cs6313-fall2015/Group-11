                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             July 23, 2014

  Mr. Merkley (for himself and Mr. Alexander) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
     Designating the week of August 10 through August 16, 2014, as 
             ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week''.

Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are nonprofit, community-based health care 
        sites that offer primary care and wellness services based on the nursing 
        model;
Whereas the nursing model emphasizes the protection, promotion, and optimization 
        of health, the prevention of illness, the alleviation of suffering, and 
        the diagnosis and treatment of illness;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics are led by advanced practice nurses and 
        staffed by an interdisciplinary team of highly qualified health care 
        professionals;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offer a broad scope of services, including 
        treatment for acute and chronic illnesses, routine physical exams, 
        immunizations for adults and children, disease screenings, health 
        education, prenatal care, dental care, and drug and alcohol treatment;
Whereas, as of March 2014, approximately 500 nurse-managed health clinics 
        provided care across the United States and recorded more than 2,500,000 
        patient encounters annually;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics serve a unique dual role as both health 
        care safety net access points and health workforce development sites, 
        given that the majority of nurse-managed health clinics are affiliated 
        with schools of nursing and serve as clinical education sites for 
        students entering the health profession;
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics strengthen the health care safety net by 
        expanding access to primary care and chronic disease management services 
        for vulnerable and medically underserved populations in diverse rural, 
        urban, and suburban communities;
Whereas research has shown that nurse-managed health clinics experience high 
        patient retention and patient satisfaction rates and nurse-managed 
        health clinic patients experience higher rates of generic medication 
        fills and lower hospitalization rates when compared to similar safety 
        net providers;
Whereas the 2010 report of the Institute of Medicine entitled ``The Future of 
        Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health,'' highlights the work nurse-
        managed health clinics are doing to reduce health disparities by 
        bringing evidence-based care to individuals who may not otherwise 
        receive needed services; and
Whereas nurse-managed health clinics offering both primary care and wellness 
        services provide quality care in a cost-effective manner: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of August 10 through August 16, 
        2014, as ``National Nurse-Managed Health Clinic Week'';
            (2) supports the ideals and goals of National Nurse-Managed 
        Health Clinic Week; and
            (3) encourages the continued support of nurse-managed 
        health clinics so that nurse-managed health clinics may 
        continue to serve as health care workforce development sites 
        for the next generation of primary care providers.
