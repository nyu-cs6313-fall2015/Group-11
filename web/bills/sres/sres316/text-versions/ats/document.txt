                               RESOLUTION


 
      Supporting the goals and ideals of American Diabetes Month.

Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (referred to 
        in this preamble as the ``CDC''), nearly 26,000,000 individuals in the 
        United States have diabetes and an estimated 79,000,000 individuals age 
        20 years or older in the United States have prediabetes;
Whereas diabetes is a serious chronic condition that affects individuals of 
        every age, race, ethnicity, and income level;
Whereas the CDC reports that Hispanic, African, Asian, and Native Americans are 
        disproportionately affected by diabetes and suffer from the disease at 
        rates that are much higher than the general population of the United 
        States;
Whereas according to the CDC, an individual age 20 years or older is diagnosed 
        with diabetes every 17 seconds;
Whereas approximately 5,205 individuals age 20 years and older in the United 
        States are diagnosed with diabetes each day;
Whereas the CDC estimates that approximately 1,900,000 individuals in the United 
        States age 20 years and older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 
        2010;
Whereas a joint National Institutes of Health and CDC study found that each year 
        between 2002 and 2005, approximately 15,600 youth were diagnosed with 
        type 1 diabetes and approximately 3,600 youth were diagnosed with type 2 
        diabetes in the United States;
Whereas according to the CDC, the prevalence of diabetes in the United States 
        increased by more than 300 percent between 1980 and 2010;
Whereas the CDC reports that more than 27 percent of individuals with diabetes 
        in the United States have not been diagnosed with the disease;
Whereas more than 11 percent of adults and 26.9 percent of individuals age 65 
        and older in the United States have diabetes;
Whereas as many as 1 in 3 adults in the United States will have diabetes in 2050 
        if the present trend continues;
Whereas after accounting for the difference of the average age of each 
        population, data surveying individuals age 20 years and older in the 
        United States between 2007 and 2009 indicate that 7.1 percent of non-
        Hispanic whites, 12.6 percent of non-Hispanic blacks, 11.8 percent of 
        Hispanics, and 8.4 percent of Asian Americans suffered from diagnosed 
        diabetes;
Whereas after accounting for the difference of the average age of each 
        population, data surveying Hispanic individuals age 20 years and older 
        in the United States between 2007 and 2009 indicate that 7.6 percent of 
        individuals of Cuban, Central American, and South American descent, 13.3 
        percent of individuals of Mexican descent, and 13.8 percent of 
        individuals of Puerto Rican descent suffered from diagnosed diabetes;
Whereas according to the American Diabetes Association, the United States spent 
        an estimated $245,000,000,000 on cases of diagnosed diabetes in 2012;
Whereas the American Diabetes Association reports that 20 percent of the money 
        that the United States spent on health care in 2012 went towards caring 
        for individuals with diabetes;
Whereas a Mathematica Policy Research study found that total expenditures for 
        individuals with diabetes receiving benefits under the Medicare program 
        under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) in 
        fiscal year 2005 comprised 32.7 percent of the budget for such program 
        in such fiscal year;
Whereas according to the CDC, in 2007, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of 
        death in the United States, contributing to the death of more than 
        230,000 individuals in the United States that year;
Whereas a cure for diabetes does not exist as of November 2013;
Whereas there are successful means to reduce the incidence of and delay the 
        onset of type 2 diabetes;
Whereas with proper management and treatment, individuals with diabetes live 
        healthy, productive lives; and
Whereas individuals in the United States celebrate American Diabetes Month in 
        November: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of American Diabetes 
        Month, including--
                    (A) encouraging individuals in the United States to 
                fight diabetes through public awareness of prevention 
                and treatment options; and
                    (B) enhancing diabetes education;
            (2) recognizes the importance of early detection, awareness 
        of the symptoms, and understanding the risk factors of 
        diabetes, including--
                    (A) being over the age of 45;
                    (B) having a specific racial and ethnic background;
                    (C) being overweight;
                    (D) having a low level of physical activity;
                    (E) having high blood pressure; and
                    (F) having a family history of diabetes or a 
                history of diabetes during pregnancy; and
            (3) supports decreasing the prevalence of type 1, type 2, 
        and gestational diabetes in the United States through increased 
        research, treatment, and prevention.
