                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week of October 13, 2013, through October 19, 2013, as 
   ``National Case Management Week'' to recognize the value of case 
       management in improving healthcare outcomes for patients.

Whereas case management is a collaborative process of assessment, education, 
        planning, facilitation, care coordination, evaluation, and advocacy;
Whereas the goal of case management is to meet the health needs of the patient 
        and the family of the patient, while respecting and assuring the right 
        of the patient to self determination, through communication and 
        available resources in order to promote quality, cost-effective 
        outcomes;
Whereas case managers are advocates who help patients understand their current 
        health status and ways to improve their health, and in this way serve as 
        catalysts who guide patients and provide cohesion with other 
        professionals in the healthcare delivery team;
Whereas case managers are an important link to quality healthcare;
Whereas the American Case Management Association and the Case Management Society 
        of America work diligently to bring awareness to the broad range of 
        services case managers offer and to educate providers, payers, and 
        regulators on the improved patient outcomes that case management 
        services can provide;
Whereas, through National Case Management Week, the American Case Management 
        Association and the Case Management Society of America hope to continue 
        to educate providers, payers, regulators, and consumers about the value 
        case managers bring to the successful delivery of healthcare;
Whereas the American Case Management Association and the Case Management Society 
        of America will celebrate National Case Management Week during the week 
        of October 13, 2013, through October 19, 2013, in order to recognize 
        case managers as an essential link to quality healthcare; and
Whereas it is appropriate at that time to recognize the many achievements of 
        case managers in improving healthcare outcomes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of October 13, 2013, through 
        October 19, 2013, as ``National Case Management Week'';
            (2) recognizes the value of case management in providing 
        successful and cost-effective healthcare; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Case Management Week and learn about the field of case 
        management.
