                               RESOLUTION


 
   To authorize testimony, documents, and representation in State of 
               Florida v. Lawrence, Denny, & Scarbrough.

Whereas, in the cases of State of Florida v. Lawrence, Case No. 2013-CM-011301, 
        State of Florida v. Denny, Case No. 2013-CM-011303, and State of Florida 
        v. Scarbrough, Case No. 2013-CM-011311, pending in the Thirteenth 
        Judicial Circuit of Hillsborough County Court in Tampa, Florida, the 
        prosecution has requested the production of documents and testimony from 
        an employee in the office of Senator Marco Rubio;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent an employee of the Senate with respect 
        to any subpoena, order, or request for testimony relating to his 
        official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Ryan Patmintra, an employee in the Office of Senator 
Marco Rubio, and any other employee of that office from whom relevant 
evidence may be sought, are authorized to produce documents and provide 
testimony in the cases of State of Florida v. Lawrence, Denny, & 
Scarbrough, except concerning matters for which a privilege should be 
asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
employees of Senator Rubio's office in connection with the production 
of evidence authorized in section one of this resolution.
                                 <all>
