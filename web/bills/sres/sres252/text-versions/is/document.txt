                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate on steps the Government of Iran must 
     take before President Obama meets with the President of Iran.

Whereas the newly elected President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, is attending the 
        68th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City;
Whereas the Government of Iran has yet to take any practical steps towards 
        halting Iran's nuclear programs and remains a committed state-sponsor of 
        terrorist groups that have been responsible for American deaths in 
        Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Afghanistan;
Whereas, since the election of President Rouhani, the persecution by the 
        Government of Iran of religious minorities, notably Christians, has 
        increased not decreased, and the United States citizen Pastor Sayeed 
        Abedini has endured a year of brutal imprisonment for professing his 
        faith;
Whereas President Rouhani has called Israel the ``Zionist state'' that has been 
        ``a wound that has sat on the body of the Muslim world for years and 
        needs to be removed''; and
Whereas President Barack Obama has signaled a willingness to meet with President 
        Rouhani in New York during the meeting of the United Nations Security 
        Council or thereafter: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that President Obama 
should not engage in any meeting with President Rouhani before the 
Government of Iran--
            (1) affirms the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state; 
        and
            (2) immediately and without conditions releases all United 
        States citizens unjustly detained as prisoners of conscience in 
        Iran.
                                 <all>
