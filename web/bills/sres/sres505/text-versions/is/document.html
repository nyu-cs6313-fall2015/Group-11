Congratulating the Gay, Lesbian, and Allies Senate Staff (GLASS) Caucus 
       association on the 10-year anniversary of the association.

Whereas on April 23, 2004, several Senate staffers joined to form a first-of-
        its-kind staff association for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``LGBT'') Senate staff and their 
        allies;
Whereas the Gay, Lesbian, and Allies Senate Staff Caucus association (referred 
        to in this preamble as the ``GLASS Caucus association'') continues to 
        serve the Senate community by raising awareness of issues affecting the 
        LGBT community;
Whereas the GLASS Caucus association continues to promote the welfare and 
        dignity of LGBT Senate employees; and
Whereas the GLASS Caucus association continues to provide a safe environment for 
        social interaction and professional development: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the Gay, Lesbian, and Allies Senate Staff 
        Caucus association (referred to in this resolution as the 
        ``GLASS Caucus association'') on the momentous occasion of the 
        association's 10th anniversary;
            (2) commends the late Senator Frank Raleigh Lautenberg of 
        New Jersey for the critical role he played in the formation of 
        the GLASS Caucus association and for his stalwart support for 
        equality; and
            (3) recognizes inaugural GLASS Caucus Steering Committee 
        members Lynden Armstrong, Brett Bearce, Jeffrey Levensaler, 
        Josh Brekenfeld, Jason Knapp, John Fossum, Kelsey Phipps, and 
        Mat Young for their vision and hard work in establishing the 
        GLASS Caucus association.
