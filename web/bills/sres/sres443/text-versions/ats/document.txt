        designate the week beginning May 27, 1984, as `National Tourism Week''',

        recognized the value of travel and tourism;
Whereas National Travel and Tourism Week is celebrated across the United States 
        from May 3 through May 11, 2014;
Whereas more than 200 travel destinations throughout the United States are 
        holding events in honor of National Travel and Tourism Week;
Whereas one out of every 9 jobs in the United States depends on travel and 
        tourism and the industry supports more than 14,900,000 jobs in the 
        United States, including 7,900,000 directly in the travel industry and 
        7,000,000 in related industries;
Whereas the travel and tourism industry is among the top 10 industries in 49 
        States and the District of Columbia in terms of employment;
Whereas international travel to the United States is the single largest export 
        industry in the country, generating a trade surplus balance of 
        $57,100,000,000 in 2013;
Whereas the travel and tourism industry, Congress, and the President have worked 
        to streamline the visa process and make the United States welcoming to 
        visitors from other countries;
Whereas travel and tourism provide significant economic benefits to the United 
        States by generating $2,100,000,000,000 in annual economic output;
Whereas leisure travel allows individuals to experience the rich cultural 
        heritage and educational opportunities of the United States and its 
        communities; and
