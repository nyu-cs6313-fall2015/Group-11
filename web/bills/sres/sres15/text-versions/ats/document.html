        under this paragraph, the right to offer that amendment is 
        forfeited.
            (2) If a cloture motion has been filed pursuant to rule 
        XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate on a measure or matter 
        proceeded to under this section, it shall not be in order for 
        the minority to propose its first amendment unless it has been 
        submitted to the Senate Journal Clerk by 1:00 p.m. on the day 
        following the filing of that cloture motion, for the majority 
        to propose its first amendment unless it has been submitted to 
        the Senate Journal Clerk by 3:00 p.m. on the day following the 
        filing of that cloture motion, for the minority to propose its 
        second amendment unless it has been submitted to the Senate 
        Journal Clerk by 5:00 p.m. on the day following the filing of 
        that cloture motion, or for the majority to propose its second 
        amendment unless it has been submitted to the Senate Journal

        disposed of before the next amendment in order under paragraph 
        (1) may be offered.
            (4) An amendment offered under paragraph (1) is not 
        divisible or subject to amendment while pending.

            (7) No motion to commit or recommit shall be in order 
        during the pendency of any amendment offered pursuant to 
        paragraph (1).
            (8) Notwithstanding rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the

        usual form. Any amendment offered under paragraph (1) that is
