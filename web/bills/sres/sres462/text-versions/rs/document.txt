                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters of Cambodia and 
Laos for supporting and defending the United States Armed Forces during 
  the conflict in Southeast Asia and for their continued support and 
                     defense of the United States.

Whereas the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters (also known as the ``Khmer and 
        Lao/Hmong veterans'') fought and died with United States Armed Forces 
        during the conflict in Southeast Asia;
Whereas the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters rescued United States pilots 
        shot down in enemy-controlled territory and returned the pilots to 
        safety;
Whereas the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters retrieved and prevented from 
        falling into enemy hands secret and sensitive information, technology, 
        and equipment;
Whereas the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters captured and destroyed enemy 
        supplies and prevented enemy forces from using the supplies to kill 
        members of the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters gathered and provided to the 
        United States Armed Forces intelligence about enemy troop positions, 
        movement, and strength;
Whereas the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters provided food, shelter, and 
        support to the United States Armed Forces;
Whereas the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters facilitated the evacuation of 
        the United States Embassy in Phnom Penh on April 12, 1975, by continuing 
        to fight Khmer Rouge forces as the forces advanced upon the capital;
Whereas, in 2014, the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters are still subject to 
        intimidation, ridicule, discrimination, and death if identified in 
        Cambodia or Laos;
Whereas veterans of the Khmer Mobile Guerrilla Forces, the Lao/Hmong Special 
        Guerrilla Units, and the Khmer Republic Armed Forces defended human 
        rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of 
        representation and association; and
Whereas the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters have not yet received official 
        recognition from the United States Government for their heroic efforts 
        and support: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate affirms and recognizes the Khmer and Lao/
Hmong Freedom Fighters and the people of Cambodia and Laos for their 
support and defense of the United States Armed Forces and freedom of 
democracy in Southeast Asia.
            Amend the title so as to read: ``A resolution recognizing 
        the Khmer and Lao/Hmong Freedom Fighters of Cambodia and Laos 
        for supporting and defending the United States Armed Forces 
        during the conflict in Southeast Asia.''.
