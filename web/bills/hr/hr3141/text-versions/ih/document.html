    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall--
            (1) not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of 
        the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland

        implementation plan to establish a biometric exit data system 
        in accordance with section 7208 of the Intelligence Reform and 
        Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (8 U.S.C. 1365b), including--
                    (A) an estimate of the time needed to establish 
                such a system;
                    (B) an estimate of operational and maintenance 
                costs of such a system;
                    (C) staffing and personnel requirements of such a 
                system;
                    (D) an assessment of the training programs 
                necessary to establish such a system;
                    (E) an assessment of how such a system will affect 
                wait times; and
                    (F) information received after consultation with 
                private sector stakeholders;
            (2) not later than two years after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, establish a biometric exit data system 
        at--
                    (A) the ten United States airports that support the 
                highest volume of international air travel, as 
                determined by available Federal flight data; and
                    (B) the ten United States seaports that support the 
                highest volume of international sea travel, as 
                determined by available Federal travel data; and
            (3) not later than three years after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, submit to the Committee on Homeland 
        Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
        Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a 
        report, in accordance with subsection (d), that analyzes the 
        effectiveness of the biometric exit data system referred to in 
        paragraph (1) at the ten international airports and ten 
        international seaports described in paragraph (2).
    (b) Implementation.--
            (1) Pilot program for non-pedestrian outbound traffic.--
                    (A) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the 
                date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
                Homeland Security shall establish a six-month pilot 
                program to test the biometric exit data system referred 
                to in subsection (a)(2) on non-pedestrian outbound 
                traffic at not fewer than three land ports of entry 
                with significant cross-border traffic, including at not 
                fewer than two land ports of entry on the southern 
                border and at at least one land port of entry on the 
                northern border. Such pilot program may include a 
                consideration of more than one biometric mode, and 
                shall be implemented to determine the following:
                            (i) The feasibility of implementing 
                        biometric exit data systems at land ports of 
                        entry nationwide.
                            (ii) The infrastructure required to carry 
                        out clause (i).
                            (iii) The effects of such pilot program on 
                        legitimate travel and trade.
                            (iv) The effects of such pilot program on 
                        wait times for such non-pedestrian traffic.
                    (B) GAO review.--Not later than 30 days after the 
                conclusion of the pilot program under subparagraph (A), 
                the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit the 
                results of the determinations made pursuant to such 
                subparagraph to the Government Accountability Office

                (B), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, based on 
                such review and the results of the determinations under 
                subparagraph (A), submit to the Committee on Homeland 
                Security of the House of Representatives and the 
                Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs 
                of the Senate a plan to implement a biometric exit data 
                system at all land ports of entry for non-pedestrian 
                outbound traffic.
            (2) At land ports of entry for pedestrians.--Not later than
