                                 A BILL


 
 To improve the understanding and coordination of critical care health 
                               services.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Critical Care Assessment and 
Improvement Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Critical care medicine is the care for patients whose 
        illnesses or injuries present a significant danger to life, 
        limb, or organ function and require comprehensive care and 
        constant monitoring, usually in intensive care units (ICUs).
            (2) Each year, approximately five million Americans are 
        admitted into adult medical, surgical, pediatric, or neonatal 
        ICUs.
            (3) Critical care medicine encompasses a wide array of 
        diseases and health issues. The care provided in the ICU is 
        highly specialized and complex due to the extreme severity of 
        illness of its patient population, often involving multiple 
        disease processes in different organ systems at the same time.
            (4) Critical care medicine consumes a significant amount of 
        financial resources, accounting for more than 17 percent of all 
        hospital costs.
            (5) According to a recent study published in the Journal of 
        Critical Care Medicine, despite the fact that cancer care and 
        critical care place similar economic burdens on society, 
        proportionally 3.1 to 11.4 times more research money was spent 
        on cancer care research than critical care research.
            (6) According to a 2006 report by the Health Resources and 
        Services Administration (``HRSA''), demand in the United States 
        for critical care medical services is on the rise, due in part 
        to the growing elderly population, as individuals over the age 
        of 65 consume a large percentage of critical care services.
            (7) The HRSA report also found that the growing aging 
        population will further exacerbate an existing shortage of 
        intensivists, the physicians certified in critical care who 
        primarily deliver care in intensive care units, potentially 
        compromising the quality and availability of care. Today, 
        intensivist-led teams treat only one-third of critically ill 
        patients despite substantial evidence that these teams lead to 
        improved outcomes.
            (8) Ensuring the strength of our critical care medical 
        delivery infrastructure is integral to the improvement of the 
        quality and delivery of health care in the United States.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assess the current 
state of the United States critical care medical delivery system and 
implement policies to improve the quality and effectiveness of care 
delivered to the critically ill and injured.
