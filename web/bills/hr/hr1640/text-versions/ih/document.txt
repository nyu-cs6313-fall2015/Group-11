            (1) The report of the Department of Defense Science Board 
        Task Force on Resilient Military Systems and the Advanced Cyber 
        Threat finds that ``[i]t is not clear that high-end cyber 
        practitioners can be found in sufficient numbers within typical 
        recruitments pools''.
            (2) The report recommends that ``[t]he Department must

        training, and use effectively these critical people''.

        Guard status under title 32, United States Code.
            (4) The National Guard can leverage the expertise of 
        private sector information technology (IT) specialists and help 
        retain the capability of retiring military personnel trained in 
        cybersecurity matters.
            (5) The National Guard in its status under title 32, United 
        States Code, supports the Department of Homeland Security and 
        the Governors of the States in responding to natural disasters.
