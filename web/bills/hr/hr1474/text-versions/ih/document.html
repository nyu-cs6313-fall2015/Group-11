_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To reauthorize the ban on undetectable firearms, and to extend the ban 
     to undetectable firearm receivers and undetectable ammunition 
                               magazines.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Undetectable Firearms Modernization 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) according to data from the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation, 8,583 of the 12,664 murders in the United States 
        in 2011 were committed using a firearm, and more than 57 
        percent of the murders that occurred in New York State were 
        perpetrated with a firearm;
            (2) the ability to produce a receiver for a firearm in the 
        home would circumvent a number of laws, because the receiver is 
        the component of the firearm that bears its serial number, as 
        required by regulations;
            (3) digital manufacturing technologies, including but not 
        limited to computer numerical control mills (``CNC mills''), 3-
        dimensional printers (``3D printers''), and laser cutting 
        machines, are quickly advancing to a point where it will soon 
        be possible to fabricate fully operational firearm components; 
        and
            (4) some commercially available products that utilize 
        digital manufacturing technologies to manufacture objects are 
        able to manufacture these objects using materials that are 
        unable to be detected by traditional metal detectors, and may 
        not present an accurate image on an x-ray.

SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF BAN ON UNDETECTABLE FIREARMS.

    Section 2(f)(2) of the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C. 
922 note) is amended by striking ``25'' and inserting ``35''.

SEC. 4. BAN EXTENDED TO UNDETECTABLE FIREARM RECEIVERS MADE BY 
              INDIVIDUALS.

    Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by 
                striking ``receive any firearm--'' and inserting 
                ``receive--''; and
                    (B) by striking subparagraphs (A) and (B) and 
                inserting the following:
            ``(A) any firearm--
                    ``(i) that, after removal of grips, stocks, and 
                magazines, is not as detectable as the Security 
                Exemplar, by walk-through metal detectors calibrated 
                and operated to detect the Security Exemplar; or
                    ``(ii) any major component of which, when subjected 
                to inspection by the types of x-ray machines commonly 
                used at airports, does not generate an image that 
                accurately depicts the shape of the component. Barium 
                sulfate or other compounds may be used in the 
                fabrication of the component; or
            ``(B) any receiver for a rifle, or receiver for a handgun, 
        manufactured by a person who is not a licensed manufacturer--
                    ``(i) that is not as detectable as the Receiver 
                Security Exemplar for a rifle or for a handgun, as the 
                case may be, by walk-through metal detectors calibrated 
                and operated to detect that Receiver Security Exemplar; 
                or
                    ``(ii) which, when subjected to inspection by the 
                types of x-ray machines commonly used at airports, does 
                not generate an image that accurately depicts the shape 
                of the receiver. Barium sulfate or other compounds may 
                be used in the fabrication of the receiver.'';
            (2) in paragraph (2)--
                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph 
                (B);
                    (B) by striking the period at the end of 
                subparagraph (C) and inserting ``; and''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(D) the term `Receiver Security Exemplar' means, with

                subparagraph, 3.7 ounces of material type 17-4 PH 
                stainless steel in a shape resembling the lower 
                receiver for a rifle or for a handgun, as the case may 
                be; and
                    ``(ii) suitable for testing and calibrating metal 
                detectors:
        Provided, however, That at the close of such 12-month period, 
        and at appropriate times thereafter the Attorney General shall 
        promulgate regulations to permit the manufacture, importation, 
        sale, shipment, delivery, possession, transfer, or receipt of 
        receivers for a rifle or receivers for a handgun, that were 
        previously prohibited under this subparagraph that are as 
        detectable as the `Receiver Security Exemplar' for a rifle or 
        for a handgun, as the case may be, which contains 3.7 ounces of 
        material type 17-4 PH stainless steel, in a shape resembling 
        the lower receiver for a rifle or for a handgun, as the case 
        may be, or such lesser amount as is detectable in view of 
        advances in state-of-the-art developments in weapons detection 
        technology.'';
            (3) in paragraph (3)--
                    (A) by inserting ``or receiver'' after ``firearm'' 
                each place it appears; and
                    (B) by inserting ``or receivers'' after 
                ``firearms''; and
            (4) in each of paragraphs (4) through (6), by inserting 
        ``or receiver'' after ``firearm'' each place it appears.

SEC. 5. BAN EXTENDED TO UNDETECTABLE AMMUNITION MAGAZINES MADE BY 
              INDIVIDUALS.

    Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code, as amended by
