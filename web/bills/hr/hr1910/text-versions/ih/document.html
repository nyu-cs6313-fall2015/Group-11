                                 A BILL


 
 To require foreign manufacturers of products imported into the United 
  States to establish registered agents in the United States who are 
  authorized to accept service of process against such manufacturers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Manufacturers Legal 
Accountability Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Each year, many people in the United States are injured 
        by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign 
        entities and imported into the United States.
            (2) Both consumers and businesses in the United States have 
        been harmed by injuries to people in the United States caused 
        by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign 
        entities.
            (3) People in the United States injured by defective 
        products manufactured or produced by foreign entities often 
        have difficulty recovering damages from the foreign 
        manufacturers and producers responsible for such injuries.
            (4) The difficulty described in paragraph (3) is caused by 
        the obstacles in bringing a foreign manufacturer or producer 
        into a United States court and subsequently enforcing a 
        judgment against that manufacturer or producer.
            (5) Obstacles to holding a responsible foreign manufacturer 
        or producer liable for an injury to a person in the United 
        States undermine the purpose of the tort laws of the United 
        States.
            (6) The difficulty of applying the tort laws of the United 
        States to foreign manufacturers and producers puts United 
        States manufacturers and producers at a competitive 
        disadvantage because United States manufacturers and producers 
        must--
                    (A) abide by common law and statutory safety 
                standards; and
                    (B) invest substantial resources to ensure that 
                they do so.
            (7) Foreign manufacturers and producers can avoid the 
        expenses necessary to make their products safe if they know 
        that they will not be held liable for violations of United 
        States product safety laws.
            (8) Businesses in the United States undertake numerous 
        commercial relationships with foreign manufacturers, exposing 
        the businesses to additional tort liability when foreign 
        manufacturers or producers evade United States courts.
            (9) Businesses in the United States engaged in commercial 
        relationships with foreign manufacturers or producers often 
        cannot vindicate their contractual rights if such manufacturers 
        or producers seek to avoid responsibility in United States 
        courts.
            (10) One of the major obstacles facing businesses and 
        individuals in the United States who are injured and who seek 
        compensation for economic or personal injuries caused by 
        foreign manufacturers and producers is the challenge of serving 
        process on such manufacturers and producers.
            (11) An individual or business injured in the United States 
        by a foreign company must rely on a foreign government to serve 
        process when that company is located in a country that is a 
        signatory to the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial 
        and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters done 
        at The Hague November 15, 1965 (20 UST 361; TIAS 6638).
            (12) An injured person in the United States must rely on 
        the cumbersome system of letters rogatory to effect service in 
        a country that did not sign the Convention on the Service 
        Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or 
        Commercial Matters. These countries do not have an enforceable 
        obligation to serve process as requested.
            (13) The procedures described in paragraphs (11) and (12) 
        add time and expense to litigation in the United States, 
        thereby discouraging or frustrating meritorious lawsuits 
        brought by persons injured in the United States against foreign 
        manufacturers and producers.
            (14) Foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to 
        avoid judicial consideration of their actions by asserting that 
        United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over them.
            (15) The due process clauses of the fifth amendment to and 
        section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution 
        govern United States courts' personal jurisdiction over 
        defendants.
            (16) The due process clauses described in paragraph (15) 
        are satisfied when a defendant consents to the jurisdiction of 
        a court.
            (17) United States markets present many opportunities for 
        foreign manufacturers.
            (18) In choosing to export products to the United States, a 
        foreign manufacturer or producer subjects itself to the laws of 
        the United States. Such a foreign manufacturer or producer 
        thereby acknowledges that it is subject to the personal 
        jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in at least one 
        State.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) foreign manufacturers and producers whose products are 
        sold in the United States should not be able to avoid liability 
        simply because of difficulties relating to serving process upon 
        them;
            (2) to avoid such lack of accountability, foreign 
        manufacturers and producers of foreign products distributed in 
        the United States should be required, by regulation, to 
        register an agent in the United States who is authorized to 
        accept service of process for such manufacturer or producer;
            (3) it is unfair to United States consumers and businesses 
        that foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to avoid 
        judicial consideration of their actions by asserting that 
        United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over them;
            (4) those who benefit from exporting products to United 
        States markets should expect to be subject to the jurisdiction 
        of at least one court within the United States;
            (5) exporting products to the United States should be 
        understood as consent to the accountability that the legal 
        system of the United States ensures for all manufacturers and 
        producers, foreign, and domestic;
            (6) exporters recognize the scope of opportunities 
        presented to them by United States markets but also should 
        recognize that products imported into the United States must 
        satisfy Federal and State safety standards established by 
        statute, regulation, and common law;
            (7) foreign manufacturers should recognize that they are 
        responsible for the contracts they enter into with United 
        States companies;
            (8) foreign manufacturers should act responsibly and 
        recognize that they operate within the constraints of the 
        United States legal system when they export products to the 
        United States;
            (9) United States laws and the laws of United States 
        trading partners should not put burdens on foreign 
        manufacturers and producers that do not apply to domestic 
        companies;
            (10) it is fair to ensure that foreign manufacturers, whose 
        products are distributed in commerce in the United States, are 
        subject to the jurisdiction of State and Federal courts in at 
        least one State because all United States manufacturers are 
        subject to the jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in 
        at least one State; and
            (11) it should be understood that, by registering an agent 
        for service of process in the United States, the foreign 
        manufacturer or producer acknowledges consent to the 
        jurisdiction of the State in which the registered agent is 
        located.

                        by the foreign manufacturer or producer under 
                        subparagraph (A); and
                            (iv) contains a statement that the agent 
                        acknowledges that the duties of the agent--

            (1) In general.--Beginning on the date that is 180 days

        provide to U.S. Customs and Border Protection a declaration 
        that--
                    (A) the person has made appropriate inquiry as to 
                whether the manufacturer or producer of the covered 
                product has complied with the requirements of this 
                section, including by seeking appropriate documentation 
                from the exporter of the covered product and by 
                consulting the registry established pursuant to 
                subsection (b); and
                    (B) to the best of the person's knowledge, with 
                respect to each importation of a covered product, the 
                foreign manufacturer or producer of the product has 
                registered an agent in the United States as required 
                under subsection (a).
            (2) Electronic submission.--Not later than 1 year after the

        within the data management systems of U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection.
