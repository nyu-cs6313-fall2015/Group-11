    To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for 
  treatment of audiologists as physicians for purposes of furnishing 
audiology services under the Medicare program, to improve access to the 
 audiology services available for coverage under the Medicare program 
    and to enable beneficiaries to have their choice of a qualified

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Audiology Patient Choice Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Hearing loss is the third most common chronic disorder 
        for Americans over 65, behind only arthritis and high blood 
        pressure.
            (2) Individuals with mild hearing loss are three times more 
        likely to experience a fall and falls are the leading cause of 
        injury and death for Americans over 65.
            (3) Untreated hearing and balance problems contribute to 
        and are highly correlated with depression and social isolation.
            (4) Seniors with hearing loss run a much higher risk of 
        cognitive problems and experience cognitive decline up to 40 
        percent faster than those with normal hearing.
            (5) Medicare beneficiaries should have access to the same 
        level of audiologic care as is available in the Veterans' 
        Administration, under the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
        Program, and under private insurance.
            (6) The Medicare program needs to be updated in a 
        comprehensive way so Medicare beneficiaries are able to have 
        access to all of the advancements in the delivery of audiologic 
        care.
