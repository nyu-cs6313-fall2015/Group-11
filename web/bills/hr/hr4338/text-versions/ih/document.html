                                 A BILL


 
    To amend title 49, United States Code, to require gas pipeline 
facilities to accelerate the repair, rehabilitation, and replacement of 
     high-risk pipelines used in commerce, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pipeline Modernization and Consumer 
Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS FOR HIGH-RISK NATURAL GAS PIPELINES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) Federal requirements related to repairing pipeline 
        leaks are limited to ``hazardous'' leaks, which are leaks that 
        represent an existing or probable hazard to persons or property 
        and require immediate repair;
            (2) there are no Federal requirements to address slower or 
        less hazardous leaks, which can allow the leaks to persist 
        unrepaired indefinitely;
            (3) in States without a standard definition and methodology 
        for calculating unaccounted-for gas (the difference between the 
        amount of gas purchased by a utility and the amount used or 
        sold to customers), data inconsistencies may be pervasive and 
        these inconsistencies hinder the ability of regulators to 
        monitor gas system and utility performance;
            (4) the cost of leaked or otherwise unaccounted-for natural 
        gas in the distribution system is typically passed on to 
        ratepayers without limitation as an accepted cost of service, 
        which removes financial incentive for utilities to minimize the 
        leaks;
            (5) methane, the primary constituent of natural gas, is a 
        greenhouse gas at least 20 times more potent than carbon 
        dioxide;
            (6) according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
        Safety Administration, the United States natural gas 
        distribution system still includes 61,000 miles of bare steel 
        pipe without adequate corrosion protection and 32,000 miles of 
        cast iron pipe, which was installed beginning in the 1830s and 
        can be prone to failure;
            (7) major recent pipeline explosions that led to human 
        fatalities, including those in Austin, Texas, Philadelphia, 
        Pennsylvania, and Allentown, Pennsylvania, have been traced to 
        aging, leaking, and high-risk pipeline infrastructure;
            (8) natural gas distribution utilities may be discouraged 
        from making capital expenditures for the replacement of leaking 
        and failure-prone pipelines because traditional ratemaking 
        structures may not allow for cost recovery on a timely basis; 
        and
            (9) according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 
        Safety Administration, the natural gas pipeline replacement 
        programs established as part of the ratemaking process in 27 
        States and the District of Columbia have played a vital role in 
        enhancing public safety by better ensuring the prompt 
        rehabilitation, repair, or replacement of high-risk natural gas 
        distribution infrastructure.
    (b) Natural Gas Distribution Companies.--
            (1) In general.--Chapter 601 of title 49, United States 
        Code, is amended by inserting after section 60112 the

            ``(1) is leaking; or
            ``(2) may pose high risks of leaking, or may no longer be 
        fit for service, because of--
                    ``(A) inferior materials;
                    ``(B) poor construction practices;

                high-risk piping or equipment, including leaks 
                identified as part of an integrity management plan 
                developed under section 192.1007 of title 49, Code of 
                Federal Regulations, if applicable;

                        infrastructure replacement;
                            ``(ii) consideration of the economic, 
                        safety, and environmental benefits of reduced 
                        gas leakage, including consideration of reduced 
                        operation and maintenance costs and reduced 
                        costs attributable to lost or unaccounted-for 
                        natural gas; and
                            ``(iii) reporting on the reductions in lost 
                        or unaccounted-for gas as a result of pipeline 
                        replacements;
                    ``(C) adopting a standard definition and 
                methodology for calculating and reporting unaccounted-
                for gas to improve data quality;

                unaccounted-for gas; and
                    ``(E) requiring use of best available technology to

            (2) Technical and conforming amendment.--The table of 
        sections for chapter 601 of title 49, United States Code, is 
        amended by inserting after the item relating to section 60112 
        the following:

``60112A. Replacement programs for high-risk natural gas pipelines.''.
    (c) Non-Binding Guidelines for Identifying and Classifying High-
Risk Pipeline Infrastructure.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Pipeline and 
        Hazardous Materials Safety Administration shall, after 
        consultation with State regulatory authorities, the Secretary 
        of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and other 
        appropriate Federal agencies, and after notice and opportunity 
        for comment, issue non-binding guidelines identifying best 
        practices under section 60112A of title 49, United States Code

        actions already taken by State regulatory authorities to ensure 
        proper identification, classification, and timely repair of 
        high-risk pipeline infrastructure and leaks, including actions 
        taken after consideration of the standard under section 
        303(b)(6) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 
        (15 U.S.C. 3203(b)(6)).
