  <summary>9/18/2014--Introduced.
Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to study and report on the interoperability of computer systems used by hospitals to store and access electronic health records.

Requires the study to explore the ability of hospital computer systems to allow more than one hospital to access and update the electronic health records of the same patient, including: (1) the identity of hospitals that use computer systems with this ability, (2) reasons hospitals do not have computer systems with this ability, and (3) whether this ability allows hospitals to more effectively coordinate patient care.</summary>
