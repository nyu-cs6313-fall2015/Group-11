  <summary>9/18/2014--Introduced.
Directs the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to revise the management plan for the conservation pool in Lake Texoma (Oklahoma and Texas) to ensure that: (1) the water surface elevation is maintained between 619 and 614 mean sea level; (2) if the water surface elevation is at or below 614 mean sea level, hydroelectric power generation is only conducted upon a determination by the Secretary, in consultation with the Lake Texoma Advisory Committee, that there are emergency power needs, including needs resulting from a natural disaster; and (3) additional water capacity resulting from the revised mean surface elevation may be made available for allocation and, if allocated, district water suppliers will be prioritized.</summary>
