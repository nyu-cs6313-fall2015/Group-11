            (2) Subsection (b) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following:
            ``(4)(A) Whenever a complaint relies, in whole or in part, 
        on activity falling under subparagraph (C) or (D) of subsection 
        (a)(3) in order to meet the legal standard set forth in 
        subsection (a)(3), the Commission may not initiate an 
        investigation until the Commission has first conducted a 
        preliminary investigation of whether it is likely that an 
        industry in the United States exists or is in the process of 
        being established within the meaning of subsection (a)(2).
            ``(B) In the preliminary investigation under subparagraph 
        (A), the complainant's case shall be limited to the assertions 
        and evidence set forth in the complaint, and confidential 
        business information contained in the complaint that may be 
        disclosed under protective order, and the Commission shall 
        accept additional facts, evidence, and argument from named 
        respondents and the public.
            ``(C) The Commission shall render its determination in the 
        preliminary investigation under this paragraph not later than 
        45 days after the filing of the complaint. If the Commission 
        finds that it is not likely that an industry in the United 
        States exists or is in the process of being established, the 
        Commission may not initiate an investigation of the matter 
        alleged in the complaint.''.

        investigation that the articles under investigation should not 
        be excluded from entry based upon consideration of the public 
        interest, including the effect of such exclusion upon the 
        public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the United 
        States economy, the production of like or directly competitive 
        articles in the United States, United States consumers, whether 
        protected articles in the United States will be protected by an 
        exclusion order, and whether the complainant or its licensees 
        can meet market demand for protected articles; and
            ``(ii) upon a finding under clause (i) that the articles
