(Sec. 210) Directs the Secretary to submit an authorization request to Congress for each fiscal year.

(Sec. 211) Requires the Commandant to: (1) establish, and update on an ongoing basis, an inventory of real property, including submerged lands, under Coast Guard control; and (2) make divestiture and consolidation recommendations to Congress every five years.

Requires the Commandant to submit to Congress: (1) a strategy to meet the Coast Guard's Arctic ice operations needs through September 30, 2050; and (2) unless the Secretary determines that it is cost-effective to reactivate the Polar Sea, a bridging strategy for maintaining the Coast Guard's polar icebreaking services until at least September 30, 2024 (currently, a bridging strategy for maintaining operations until at least September 30, 2022, is required only if the Secretary determines that it is not cost-effective to reactivate the Polar Sea).

(Sec. 215) Allows the Secretary, each fiscal year beginning in FY2015, to enter into multiyear contracts for the procurement of Offshore Patrol Cutters and associated equipment.

(Sec. 216) Directs the Secretary to report to Congress with schedules and plans for decommissioning, maintaining or extending, and commissioning specified categories of cutters.

(Sec. 220) Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) request and accept through a direct military-to-military transfer such H-60 helicopters as necessary to establish a year-round operational capability in the Coast Guard's ninth district (headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, and responsible for a region including the Great Lakes); and (2) use appropriations to convert the configuration of such helicopters.

Provides for the reimbursement of vessel owners or operators who provide necessary support to seafarers paroled into the United States to facilitate such investigations, reporting, documentation, or adjudications.

Defines &#8220;seafarer&#8221; as an alien crewman who is employed or engaged in any capacity on board a vessel subject to such Act.

(Sec. 316) Revises the enforcement authority of the DOT Secretary with respect to whether programs administered by federal agencies comply with the requirement that at least a specified percentage of the gross tonnage of certain cargos procured or financed by the U.S. government are transported on privately-owned commercial vessels of the United States.

Directs the DOT Secretary, on an annual basis, to: (1) determine whether agency programs are subject to such requirements; and (2) submit a report to Congress that identifies such programs and actions taken by DOT in response to violations.

(Sec. 317) Amends the Marine Debris Act to permit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), when evaluating grant proposals for marine debris projects, to give preference to proposals that address a severe marine debris event (atypically large amounts of marine debris caused by a tsunamis, floods, landslides, hurricanes, or other natural disasters or sources). Establishes a process for the governor of a state to request that NOAA declare a severe marine debris event in such state or a region including such state.

Modifies safety inspection requirements for such vessels and removes a provision that limits the vessels permitted to engage such foreign citizens to vessels operating in and out of American Samoa or Guam.

(Sec. 602) Deems the vessel assigned U.S. official number 1205366 (rebuilt after a fire) to be a new vessel on the date of delivery after January 1, 2012, from a privately owned U.S. shipyard if no encumbrances are on record with the Coast Guard at the time of the issuance of the new certificate of documentation.

(Sec. 603) Authorizes the Commandant to lease submerged lands and tidelands under the control of the Coast Guard for periods longer than five years.

(Sec. 604) Directs DOT to submit to Congress a national maritime strategy that: (1) identifies federal regulations that reduce the competitiveness of U.S. flag vessels in the international trade, (2) identifies the impact of reduced cargo flow due to reductions in the number of Armed Forces members stationed or deployed outside the United States, and (3) includes recommendations to make U.S. flag vessels more competitive in shipping routes and to enhance U.S. shipbuilding capability.

Requires such report to address the impacts, for coastal communities located in the Arctic, on: (1) the costs of delivering fuel and freight, and (2) maritime transportation safety.
