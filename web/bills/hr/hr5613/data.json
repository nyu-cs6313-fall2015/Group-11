Allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to waive the requirement for metric units if that requirement would not benefit public health.\n\nProhibits the sale of over-the-counter liquid drugs labeled for pediatric use that do not have a flow restrictor or another mechanism to reduce accidental ingestion."
