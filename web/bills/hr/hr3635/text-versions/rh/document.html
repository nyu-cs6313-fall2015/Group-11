                                 A BILL


 
 To ensure the functionality and security of new Federal websites that 
  collect personally identifiable information, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Safe and Secure Federal Websites Act 
of 2014''.

SEC. 2. ENSURING FUNCTIONALITY AND SECURITY OF NEW FEDERAL WEBSITES 
              THAT COLLECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.

    (a) Certification Requirement.--
            (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided under this 
        subsection, an agency may not deploy or make available to the 
        public a new Federal PII website until the date on which the 
        chief information officer of the agency submits a certification 
        to Congress that the website is fully functional and secure.
            (2) Transition.--In the case of a new Federal PII website 
        that is operational on the date of the enactment of this Act, 
        paragraph (1) shall not apply until the end of the 90-day 
        period beginning on such date of enactment. If the 
        certification required under paragraph (1) for such website has 
        not been submitted to Congress before the end of such period, 
        the head of the responsible agency shall render the website 
        inaccessible to the public until such certification is 
        submitted to Congress.
            (3) Exception for beta website with explicit permission.--
        Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a website (or portion thereof) 
        that is in a development or testing phase, if the following 
        conditions are met:
                    (A) A member of the public may access PII-related 
                portions of the website only after executing an 
                agreement that acknowledges the risks involved.
                    (B) No agency compelled, enjoined, or otherwise 
                provided incentives for such a member to access the 
                website for such purposes.
            (4) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
        construed as applying to a website that is operated entirely by 
        an entity (such as a State or locality) that is independent of 
        the Federal Government, regardless of the receipt of funding in 
        support of such website from the Federal Government.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given that 
        term under section 551 of title 5, United States Code.
            (2) Fully functional.--The term ``fully functional'' means, 
        with respect to a new Federal PII website, that the website can 
        fully support the activities for which it is designed or 
        intended with regard to the eliciting, collection, storage, or 
        maintenance of personally identifiable information, including 
        handling a volume of queries relating to such information 
        commensurate with the purpose for which the website is 
        designed.
            (3) New federal personally identifiable information website 
        (new federal pii website).--The terms ``new Federal personally 
        identifiable information website'' and ``new Federal PII 
        website'' mean a website that--

                personally identifiable information of individuals and 
                is accessible to the public; and
                    (C) is first made accessible to the public and 
                collects or stores personally identifiable information

            (5) Personally identifiable information (pii).--The terms 
        ``personally identifiable information'' and ``PII'' mean any 
        information about an individual elicited, collected, stored, or 
        maintained by an agency, including--
                    (A) any information that can be used to distinguish 
                or trace the identity of an individual, such as a name, 
                a social security number, a date and place of birth, a 
                mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and
                    (B) any other information that is linked or 
                linkable to an individual, such as medical, 
                educational, financial, and employment information.
            (6) Responsible agency.--The term ``responsible agency'' 
        means, with respect to a new Federal PII website, the agency 
        that is responsible for the operation (whether directly or 
        through contracts with other entities) of the website.
            (7) Secure.--The term ``secure'' means, with respect to a

                III of chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code.
                    (B) The website ensures that personally 
                identifiable information elicited, collected, stored, 
                or maintained in connection with the website is 
                captured at the latest possible step in a user input 
                sequence.
                    (C) The responsible agency for the website has 
                taken reasonable efforts to minimize domain name 
                confusion, including through additional domain 
                registrations.
                    (D) The responsible agency requires all personnel 
                who have access to personally identifiable information

                with respect to personally identifiable information, 
                and the agency takes proper precautions to ensure only 
                trustworthy persons may access such information.
                    (E) The responsible agency maintains (either

                respond in a timely manner to issues relating to the 
                proper functioning and security of the website, and to 
                monitor on an ongoing basis existing and emerging
