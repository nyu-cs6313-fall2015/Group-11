            (1) In general.--Paragraph (2) of section 48B(c) of the 
        Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:
            ``(2) Gasification technology.--The term `gasification 
        technology' means--
                    ``(A) any process which converts a solid or liquid 
                product from coal, petroleum residue, biomass, or other 
                materials which are recovered for their energy or 
                feedstock value into a synthesis gas composed primarily 
                of carbon monoxide and hydrogen for direct use or 
                subsequent chemical or physical conversion, and
                    ``(B) any qualified methane conversion 
                technology.''.
            (2) Qualified methane conversion technology.--Subsection 
        (c) of section 48B of such Code is amended by adding at the end

            ``(9) Qualified methane conversion technology.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified methane 
                conversion technology' means a process consisting of 
                the molecular conversion of methane into hydrocarbons, 
                and the subsequent use of such hydrocarbons, if such 
                hydrocarbons are principally intended to be used--
                            ``(i) to replace or reduce the quantity of 
                        petroleum present in a fuel used in motor 
                        vehicles, motor vehicle engines, nonroad 
                        vehicles, nonroad engines, or aircraft if--

                                ongoing basis, not more than such 
                                emissions from the equivalent 
                                conventional fuel produced from 
                                conventional petroleum sources,
                                    ``(II) the sulfur concentration is 
                                not more than 2 parts per million, and

                uses qualified methane conversion technology to produce 
                both fuels and chemicals, the requirements described in 
                subparagraph (A)(i) shall apply only if the primary use 
                of the facility is to produce fuels.
