  <summary>5/24/2014--Public Law.
(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.)

Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to convey all interest of the United States in two parcels of land within the boundaries of the Coconino National Forest, Arizona, that contain private improvements that landowners developed based upon an erroneous survey conducted in May 1960, to the person or legal entity representing the majority of those landowners.

Requires the person or legal entity that represents such landowners to pay $20,000.00 to the Secretary as consideration for the conveyance of the parcels.

Requires the Secretary to deposit the consideration received under this Act into a special account in the fund established under the Sisk Act and to make such deposited funds available for the acquisition of land in the National Forest System.

Revokes public orders withdrawing any of the federal land from appropriation or disposal under the public land laws, to the extent necessary to permit the conveyance of all of the federal land.

Withdraws the federal land authorized for conveyance under this Act from entry and appropriation under the public land laws, location, entry, and patent under the mining laws, and operation of the mineral leasing and geothermal leasing laws until the completion of the conveyance.

Makes the conveyance authorized by this Act subject only to such surveys and clearances as are needed to protect U.S. interests.

Terminates the authority provided under this Act three years after this Act's enactment.</summary>
