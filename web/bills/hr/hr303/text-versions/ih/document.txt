                                 A BILL


 
  To amend title 10, United States Code, to permit additional retired 
members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability to 
 receive both disability compensation from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs for their disability and either retired pay by reason of their 
years of military service or Combat-Related Special Compensation and to 
 eliminate the phase-in period under current law with respect to such 
                          concurrent receipt.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Retired Pay Restoration Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) For more than 100 years before 1999, all disabled 
        military retirees were required to fund their own veterans' 
        disability compensation by forfeiting one dollar of earned 
        retired pay for each dollar received in veterans' disability 
        compensation.
            (2) Since 1999, Congress has enacted legislation to 
        progressively expand eligibility criteria for relief of the 
        retired pay disability offset and reduce the burden of 
        financial sacrifice on disabled military retirees.
            (3) Absent adequate funding to eliminate the sacrifice for 
        all disabled retirees, Congress has given initial priority to 
        easing financial inequities for the most severely disabled and 
        for combat-disabled retirees.
            (4) In the interest of maximizing eligibility within cost 
        constraints, Congress effectively has authorized full 
        concurrent receipt for all qualifying retirees with 100-percent 
        disability ratings and all qualifying retirees with combat-
        related disability ratings, while phasing out the disability 
        offset to retired pay over 10 years for retired members with 
        noncombat-related, service-connected disability ratings of 50 
        percent to 90 percent.
            (5) In pursuing these good-faith efforts, Congress 
        acknowledges the regrettable necessity of creating new 
        thresholds of eligibility that understandably are disappointing 
        to disabled retirees who fall short of meeting those new 
        thresholds.
            (6) Congress is not content with the status quo.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that military 
retired pay earned by service and sacrifice in defending the United 
States should not be reduced because a military retiree is also 
eligible for veterans' disability compensation awarded for service-
connected disability.

SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR PAYMENT OF BOTH RETIRED PAY AND VETERANS'
