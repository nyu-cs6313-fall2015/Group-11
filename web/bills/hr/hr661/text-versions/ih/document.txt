                                 A BILL


 
  To repeal certain impediments to the administration of the firearms 
                                 laws.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Tiahrt Restrictions Repeal Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Tiahrt Amendments severely limit the authority of 
        the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives 
        (BATFE) to disclose crime gun trace data to the public.
            (2) The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collection of 
        valuable information, and the establishment of effective 
        policies to prevent illegal guns.
            (3) Having effective policies to prevent illegal gun 
        trafficking makes our families and communities safer.
            (4) The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforcement of the gun 
        laws by requiring most background check records to be destroyed 
        within 24 hours, and by barring the government from requiring 
        annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops
            (5) Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law 
        enforcement efforts and give the public vital information 
        needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal 
        guns.
