Accelerating Innovation in Medicine Act of 2013 or AIM Act of 2013 - Amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop an AIM list of medical devices for which, because of their inclusion on the list, insurance benefits and payments are prohibited under Medicare (either directly or on a capitated basis), with the result that no Medicare claim may be submitted and an individual who consents to receive such a device is responsible for paying for it and for any related services.

Directs the Secretary to post on a public HHS website or other publicly accessible media an updated list of the medical devices on the AIM list.</summary>
