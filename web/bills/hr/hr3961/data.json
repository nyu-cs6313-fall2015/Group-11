The list of countries eligible for the license exception covers those countries with respect to which the reasons for control that would ordinarily impose the license requirement include national security, chemical or biological weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, regional stability, crime control, and/or significant items authorized for destinations in or nationals of a specified Country Group.)"
