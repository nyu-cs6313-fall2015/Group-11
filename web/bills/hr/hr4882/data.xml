  <summary>6/17/2014--Introduced.
Southwest Border Protection Act of 2014 - Requires Secretary of Defense (DOD), at the request of a governor of a state that shares a portion of the international border between the United States and Mexico, to order to active duty, and provide for the deployment of, at least 10,000 members of the National Guard to assist the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in achieving operational control of such border. Provides for such deployment to be in addition to the number of National Guard members already deployed along such border as of the enactment of this Act.

Requires such a governor-requested deployment to continue until: (1) the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) certifies that the federal government has achieved operational control, or (2) the governor withdraws the request.

Exempts National Guard members deployed under this Act from being counted toward any limits on: (1) end strength, or (2) the number of National Guard personnel that may be placed on active duty for operational support.</summary>
