SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The National Center for Education Statistics found that 
        high school students from 29 nations performed better in math 
        than high school students from the United States.
            (2) High school students from 22 nations performed better 
        in science than high school students from the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should be at the forefront of 
        education for science, technology, engineering, and math (in 
        this section referred to as ``STEM'');
            (2) students in low income and rural areas have limited 
        access to STEM resources;
            (3) teachers should have high-quality professional 
        development opportunities in STEM to increase their content 
        knowledge and improve student learning; and
            (4) teacher professional development should provide 
        strategies for integrating STEM education across all 
        demographics.

SEC. 3. USES OF FUNDS FOR RURAL AND LOW-INCOME SCHOOL PROGRAM.

    Section 6222(a)(2) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of
