                        case of an ACO that has elected a two-sided 
                        risk model (as described in paragraph (1)), the 
                        ACO may elect to have the limitations on 
                        originating site (under paragraph (4)(C) of 
                        such section) and on the use of store-and-
                        forward technologies (under paragraph (1) of 
                        such section) not apply. The previous sentence 
                        shall not be construed as affecting the 
                        authority of the Secretary under subsection (f)

                        connection with home health services.--Nothing 
                        in this section shall be construed as 
                        preventing an ACO from including payments for 
                        remote patient monitoring and home-based video 
                        conferencing services in connection with the 
                        provision of home health services (under

                        would not be made under section 1895 for such 
                        services) in a manner that is financially 
                        equivalent to the furnishing of a home health 
                        visit.

                    ``(A) Benchmarks and payments.--The Secretary shall 
                conduct a demonstration project to test the use of

                area differences, such as differences in spending 
                trends within and across regions, and variations in 
                delivery and utilization based on the socioeconomic 
                status of beneficiaries served.

                access of providers of services and suppliers to in-
                process and complete patient claims data. Such system 
                may be a modification of an existing data base, such as 
                the Virtual Research Data Center. The study shall take 
                into account the measures needed to ensure the security 
                and privacy of beneficiary and provider information. 
                Not later than one year after the date of the enactment 
                of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a 
                report on such study. The Secretary shall include in 
                such report such recommendations as the Secretary deems 
                appropriate.''.

        demonstration programs to test the payment model described in 
        paragraph (3)(A)''; and
            (3) in paragraph (3)(A), by striking ``is any payment 
        model'' and inserting the following:
                    ``(i) a global capitation model in which an ACO is 
                at financial risk for all items and services covered 
                under parts A and B; and
                    ``(ii) any other payment model that the Secretary 
                determines will improve the quality and efficiency of 
                items and services furnished under this title.''.

recommendations, including such changes in legislation, as the 
Secretary deems appropriate.
    (e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2016.
