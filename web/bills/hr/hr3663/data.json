Prohibits the Secretary from defining the phrase \"costs of complying\" or establishing or suggesting how a school food authority is to calculate those costs or increased costs for complying.\n\nMaintains these prohibitions until a law is enacted that extends by at least five fiscal years the authorization or duration of one or more school lunch or breakfast programs."
