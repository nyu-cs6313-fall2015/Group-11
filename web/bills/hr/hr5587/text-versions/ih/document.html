        to such controlled substances from the PDMP available to State 
        regulators and licensing boards; and

        back programs'' and fixed medicine disposal sites at law 
        enforcement public buildings; and
            (2) to reduce opportunities for abuse of opiates, such as 
        establishing opioid dispensing limits at hospital emergency
