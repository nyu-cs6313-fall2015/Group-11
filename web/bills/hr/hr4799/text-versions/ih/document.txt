        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall not 
        promulgate, implement, or enforce a Federal implementation

                indicating the Administrator's intent to implement and 
                enforce such obligations; and
                    (B) the Administrator provides such State with at 
                least 2 years from the date of such publication to
