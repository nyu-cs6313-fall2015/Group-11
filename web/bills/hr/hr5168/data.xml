  <summary>7/23/2014--Introduced.
Full-Service Community Schools Act of 2014 - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award matching grants to: (1) consortia composed of one or more local educational agencies (LEAs) and one or more community-based, nonprofit, or other public or private entities to assist public elementary or secondary schools to function as full-service community schools; and (2) state collaboratives to support the development of full-service community school programs.

Requires such schools to: (1) participate in community-based efforts to coordinate and integrate educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services through community-based organizations and public and private partnerships; and (2) provide access to such services to students, families, and the community.

Gives local grant priority to: (1) entities that will serve at least two full-service community schools eligible for a schoolwide program under the Act or that include an LEA serving only small or rural schools; and (2) entities that will be connected to a consortium that is comprised of a broad representation of stakeholders or that demonstrates a history of effectiveness.

Establishes a Full-Service Community Schools Advisory Committee.</summary>
