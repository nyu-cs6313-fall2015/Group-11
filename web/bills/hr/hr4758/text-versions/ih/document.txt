SEC. 2. CREATION OF SEARCHABLE DATABASE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall create a publicly 
available, easily navigable, and searchable database containing the 
following:
            (1) A registry of credentials (which may be certificates), 
        for purposes of enabling programs that lead to such a 
        credential to receive priority under a covered provision.
            (2) A skills database, for purposes of enabling programs 
        that lead to such a credential to receive priority under a 
        covered provision.
            (3) A jobs bank.
    (b) Credentials Registry.--In creating a registry of credentials, 
the Secretary shall--
            (1) list the credential in the registry if the credential 
        is required by Federal or State law for an occupation (such as 
        a credential required by a State law regarding qualifications 
        for a health care occupation);
            (2) list the credential, and list an updated credential, in 
        the registry if the credential involved is an industry-
        recognized, nationally portable credential that is consistent 
        with the Secretary's established industry competency models and 
        is consistently updated through third party validation to 
        reflect changing industry competencies; and
            (3) for each credential listed in the registry, provide an 
        assessment of which skills listed in the skills database 
        created under subsection (c) align with or are related to the 
        requirements of the credential.
    (c) Skills Database.--In creating a skills database, the Secretary 
shall--
            (1) list identifiable skills that are required for 
        employment in the manufacturing sector, as determined by the 
        Secretary--
                    (A) by using Manufacturing Institute-Endorsed 
                Manufacturing Skills Certification System or similar 
                resource; or
                    (B) by consulting with an organization similar to 
                the Manufacturing Institute;
            (2) after consultation with the Manufacturing Institute or 
        similar organization and representatives of the Armed Forces 
        list identifiable skills developed through service in the Armed 
        Forces; and
            (3) for each skill listed under paragraphs (1) and (2), 
        include information about how that skill aligns with or is 
        related to the requirements for the credentials listed under 
        the credentials registry created under subsection (b).
    (d) Jobs Bank.--In creating a jobs bank, the Secretary shall--
            (1) enable job seekers to--

                employment statistics system established under section 
                15 of the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49l-2) for their 
                State of residence about their skills, experience, 
                credentials, and preferred area of employment; and
                    (B) browse job listings submitted by employers to 
                such jobs bank that match the credentials, experience, 
                or other qualifications entered under subparagraph (A);
            (2) automatically match available jobs with job seekers who 
        have matching qualifications; and
            (3) enable information relating to shortages in certain 
        skills or credentials available to be utilized by State 
        workforce investment board established under section 111 of the 
        Workforce Investment Board of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 49j) and others 
        to inform decisions about how to allocate workforce development 
        resources.
