    (a) In General.--Subsection (o) of section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following new paragraph:
    ``(21) Obligation for Owners To Remain Current on Local Property 
and School Taxes.--
            ``(1) Obligation.--Each housing assistance payments 
        contract entered into by a public housing agency and the owner 
        of a dwelling unit shall provide that the owner of the dwelling 
        unit assisted under the contract shall pay, on a timely basis, 
        all covered taxes validly assessed against the property in 
        which such dwelling unit is located.
            ``(2) Authority to provide for use of assistance amounts to 
        pay delinquent taxes.--A housing assistance payments contract 
        entered into by a public housing agency and the owner of a 
        dwelling unit may provide that, upon notification by a taxing 
        authority that the owner of a dwelling unit assisted under this 
        subsection is delinquent with respect to payment of any covered 
        taxes assessed by such taxing authority against the property in 
        which such dwelling unit is located and identification of the 
        amount of such delinquency--
                    ``(A) the public housing agency shall abate all of 
                the assistance amounts under this subsection with 
                respect such property until the transfer of amounts 
                pursuant to subparagraph (B) is completed; and
                    ``(B) the agency shall transfer to such taxing 
                authority, on a monthly basis, an amount equal to the 
                monthly assistance amounts under this subsection with 
                respect to such dwelling unit (or such lesser amount as 
                may be agreed to by the agency and such authority) 
                until the delinquency identified in such notification 
                is eliminated (or for such shorter period, as may be 
                agreed to by the agency and such authority).
            ``(3) Requirements and procedures.--The Secretary shall 
        establish such requirements as may be necessary to provide for 
        the housing assistance payments contract provisions under 
        paragraphs (1) and (2), including, in the case of provisions 
        authorized by paragraph (2), such requirements regarding 
        notifications and transfer of amounts pursuant to paragraph 
        (2)(B) as may be necessary to ensure that amounts are not so 
        transferred except for actual and confirmed taxes assessed to 
        and owed by an owner of a dwelling unit, to ensure that no 
        amounts are transferred in excess of the amount of such taxes 
        owed, and to ensure the timely commencement and termination of 
        such transfers.
            ``(4) Treatment of tenants.--Nothing in this section may be 
        construed to authorize, or establish any cause or grounds for, 
        the termination of the tenancy of any tenant from any dwelling 
        unit assisted under this subsection.
            ``(5) Database.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall maintain a 
                database of information regarding--
                            ``(i) owners of dwelling units assisted 
                        under this subsection whose housing assistance 
                        payments contracts have been terminated for 
                        failure to comply with the provision required 
                        under paragraph (1); and
                            ``(ii) owners of such dwelling units with 
                        respect to whom assistance amounts have been 
                        abated and transferred to a taxing authority 
                        pursuant to paragraph (2).
                    ``(B) Contents.--Such database shall include 
                information that identifies the owner, the property for 
                which such assistance was provided, the amount 
                transferred, and the period over which such abatement 
                and transfer occurred.
                    ``(C) Information from public housing agencies.--
                The Secretary shall require public housing agencies to 
                submit information regarding the abatement and transfer 
                of assistance amounts pursuant to paragraph (2) 
                sufficient for the Secretary to maintain such database.
            ``(6) Definitions.--For purposes of this paragraph, the 
        following definitions shall apply:
                    ``(A) Covered taxes.--The term `covered taxes'
