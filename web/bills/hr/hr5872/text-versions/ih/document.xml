			<paragraph id="H8EEBCB8874BF4AA7A12D5F7E5E5F9B8F"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The current method of collecting Federal estate tax often cripples American family owned
			 businesses, farms, and ranches by forcing the sale of ongoing concerns in
			 order to pay tax liability arising from the death of an owner, creating
			 inefficiencies, dislocation, and often job losses.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0E07F70071D54E5FB6A3E3E1D1B5FF79"><enum>(2)</enum><text>From farmers and ranchers to urban business owners, the Federal estate tax looms heavily and has a
			 counterproductive effect on our Nation’s family owned businesses that
			 costs numerous jobs.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HF4FC782F07464646A253EA5A64A780EA"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The job losses, economic dislocation, and excessive compliance costs are not justified given the
			 fact that the estate tax has averaged one percent of total IRS collections
			 since 1960, with $14 billion collected in Fiscal Year 2013 (less than ½
			 percent of total IRS collections).</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H17E4C4DDED1145A48031859E260C5D8A"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Joint Economic Committee in its May 2006 study concluded that in order to avoid wealth transfer
			 taxes, individuals’ costs of complying with the estate tax roughly equals
			 the revenue yield of the estate tax for the U.S. Treasury.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HEA076B213E334F9990D3BD493084EA7B"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The current method of collection of the estate tax leads many wealthy Americans to lock up capital
			 in trusts to minimize or eliminate tax liability, meaning that billions of
			 dollars are left idle instead of facilitating the creation of new business
			 ventures that could stimulate the economy.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HE6B64ABE53C143F08B77A08D0F81E567"><enum>(6)</enum><text>As recently as 2009, of the 34,000 estate tax returns filed that year, only half owed any estate
			 tax, indicating that many wealthy Americans have found means to avoid
			 paying this tax. In 2012, 9,400 Americans still had to file estate tax
			 returns, even with the higher $5 million threshold.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H6741CE623CBD42589A27771047D00D53"><enum>(7)</enum><text>It is in the national interest to modify the mechanism for collection of revenues from those
			 Americans who have the largest estates, provided that it is done in a
			 revenue neutral manner that ensures the ongoing collection of an
			 appropriate percentage of the historical average of 1 percent of total IRS
			 tax receipts that reflects the lower amount of estate tax revenues
			 generated under the 2010 and 2012 amendments due to a higher exemption
			 amount.</text>
