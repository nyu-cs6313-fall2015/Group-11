                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow an annual elective 
        surcharge in lieu of estate tax, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``American Solution 
for Simplifying the Estate Tax Act of 2014''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Congressional findings.
Sec. 3. Elective simplified estate tax.
Sec. 4. Carry-over basis.
Sec. 5. Returns.
Sec. 6. Special rule for revocation of trusts in connection with 
                            election.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The current method of collecting Federal estate tax 
        often cripples American family owned businesses, farms, and 
        ranches by forcing the sale of ongoing concerns in order to pay 
        tax liability arising from the death of an owner, creating 
        inefficiencies, dislocation, and often job losses.
            (2) From farmers and ranchers to urban business owners, the 
        Federal estate tax looms heavily and has a counterproductive 
        effect on our Nation's family owned businesses that costs 
        numerous jobs.
            (3) The job losses, economic dislocation, and excessive 
        compliance costs are not justified given the fact that the 
        estate tax has averaged one percent of total IRS collections 
        since 1960, with $14 billion collected in Fiscal Year 2013 
        (less than \1/2\ percent of total IRS collections).
            (4) The Joint Economic Committee in its May 2006 study 
        concluded that in order to avoid wealth transfer taxes, 
        individuals' costs of complying with the estate tax roughly 
        equals the revenue yield of the estate tax for the U.S. 
        Treasury.
            (5) The current method of collection of the estate tax 
        leads many wealthy Americans to lock up capital in trusts to 
        minimize or eliminate tax liability, meaning that billions of 
        dollars are left idle instead of facilitating the creation of 
        new business ventures that could stimulate the economy.
            (6) As recently as 2009, of the 34,000 estate tax returns 
        filed that year, only half owed any estate tax, indicating that 
        many wealthy Americans have found means to avoid paying this 
        tax. In 2012, 9,400 Americans still had to file estate tax 
        returns, even with the higher $5 million threshold.
            (7) It is in the national interest to modify the mechanism 
        for collection of revenues from those Americans who have the 
        largest estates, provided that it is done in a revenue neutral 
        manner that ensures the ongoing collection of an appropriate 
        percentage of the historical average of 1 percent of total IRS 
        tax receipts that reflects the lower amount of estate tax 
        revenues generated under the 2010 and 2012 amendments due to a 
        higher exemption amount.

SEC. 3. ELECTIVE SIMPLIFIED ESTATE TAX.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subchapter:

        imposed under chapter 1 for the decedent's last taxable year by 
        an amount equal to--
