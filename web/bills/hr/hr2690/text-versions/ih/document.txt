``SEC. 3643. NEW CLASSES OF MAIL.

    ``(a) In General.--Upon request of the Postal Service or users of 
the mails, or upon its own initiative, the Postal Regulatory Commission 
may change the classes of mail to which the annual limitation under 
section 3622(d)(1) applies by adding new classes of mail. The Postal 
Regulatory Commission shall, within 18 months after the date of 
enactment of this section, promulgate (and may from time to time 
thereafter revise) regulations to carry out this section.
    ``(b) Criteria.--All determinations by the Postal Regulatory 
Commission under subsection (a) shall be made in accordance with the 
following criteria:
            ``(1) New market.--Dominant classes of mail shall consist 
        of products in the sale of which the Postal Service exercises 
        sufficient market power that it can effectively set the price 
        of such product substantially above costs, raise prices 
        significantly, decrease quality, or decrease output, without 
        risk of losing a significant level of business to other firms 
        offering similar products.
            ``(2) Products covered by postal monopoly.--Any new classes 
        of mail containing any products covered by the postal monopoly 
        shall be subject to the requirements of section 3622(d)(1). For 
        purposes of the preceding sentence, the term `product covered 
        by the postal monopoly' means any product the conveyance or 
        transmission of which is reserved to the United States under 
        section 1696 of title 18, subject to the same exception as set 
        forth in the last sentence of section 409(e)(1).
            ``(3) Additional considerations.--In making any decision 
        under this section, due regard shall be given to--
                    ``(A) the availability and nature of enterprises in 
                the private sector engaged in the delivery of the 
                product involved;
                    ``(B) the views of those who use the product 
                involved on the appropriateness of the proposed action; 
                and
                    ``(C) the likely impact of the proposed action on 
                small business concerns (within the meaning of section 
                3641(h)).
    ``(c) Notification and Publication Requirements.--
            ``(1) Notification requirement.--The Postal Service shall, 
        whenever it requests to add a new class of mail, file with the 
        Postal Regulatory Commission and publish in the Federal 
        Register a notice setting out the basis for its determination 
        that the product satisfies the criteria under subsection (b). 
        The provisions of section 504(g) shall be available with 
        respect to any information required to be filed.
            ``(2) Publication requirement.--The Postal Regulatory 
        Commission shall, whenever it changes the list of market-
        dominant classes of mail, prescribe new lists of classes of 
        mail. The revised lists shall indicate how and when any 
        previous lists are superseded, and shall be published in the 
        Federal Register.
    ``(d) Prohibition.--Except as provided in section 3641, a class of 
mail that involves the physical delivery of letters, printed matter, or 
packages may be offered by the Postal Service unless it has been 
assigned as a new class of mail--
            ``(1) under this subchapter; or
            ``(2) by or under any other provision of law.''.

sensitive advisory opinions, it shall state such request in its 
proposal filed under subsection (b) and the Commission, to the extent 
practical and in accordance with subsection (d), shall comply with the 
request for expedited consideration.''.
