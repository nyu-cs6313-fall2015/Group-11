    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to include ``older individuals who are Holocaust 
        survivors'' in the list of groups that receive preference for 
        services as defined in section 305(a)(2)(E) of the Older 
        Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3025(a)(2)(E));
            (2) to designate within the Administration on Aging an 
        individual to have responsibility for older individuals who are 
        Holocaust survivors;
            (3) to ensure that meals provided by the Act meet any 
        special health-related or other dietary needs of program 
        participants, including needs based on religious, cultural, or 
        ethnic requirements; and
            (4) to support programs that enable the mobility and self-
        sufficiency of older individuals with greatest economic need 
        and individuals with greatest social need by providing 
        transportation services and resources.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) During the Holocaust, which took place between 1933 and 
        1945, an estimated 6,000,000 Jews, as well as millions from 
        other targeted groups, were murdered by the Nazis and their 
        collaborators.
            (2) The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum 
        Encyclopedia estimates that more than 200,000 Jews found refuge 
        in the United States from 1933 to 1945 and that approximately 
        137,000 Jewish refugees had settled in the United States from 
        1945 to 1952.
            (3) Jewish refugees continued to immigrate to the United 
        States from Europe and countries of the former Soviet Union 
        over the subsequent decades.
            (4) According to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims 
        Against Germany's 2011 Worldbook: A Guide to Claims Conference 
        Programs Worldwide, the ``Estimated Nazi Victim Population'' in 
        the United States is 120,935, down from an estimated 127,300 in 
        2010.
            (5) According to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims 
        Against Germany's 2011 Worldbook: A Guide to Claims Conference 
        Programs Worldwide, 3 in 5 of Nazi victims currently residing 
        in the United States are women, and while the average age of a 
        Nazi victim is 80, nearly one-quarter are age 85 or older.
            (6) Holocaust survivors continue to live with the unique 
        mental and physical scars of the unconscionable trauma caused 
        by the Holocaust, and while institutionalized settings are 
        beneficial for some older people, the consequences of 
        institutionalization can have a particular adverse effect on 
        Holocaust survivors.
            (7) For many Holocaust survivors, institutionalized 
        settings produce sights, sounds, smells, emotions, and routines 
        that can induce panic, anxiety, and re-traumatization as a 
        result of experiences from the Holocaust.
            (8) According to Findings from the National Jewish 
        Population Survey 2000-01, a Jewish Federations of North 
        America Report produced in December 2003, ``victims are more 
        economically and socially vulnerable, report poorer health and 
        more health problems, and have somewhat greater social service 
        needs''. They also report poorer health and more disabilities 
        that limit daily activities compared to non-victims.
            (9) Low-income Holocaust survivors are more reliant on 
        social service programs than most other older Americans, and 
        proportionally more Holocaust survivors need services such as 
        personal care, home-delivered and congregate meals, 
        transportation, counseling, and mental health support to 
        promote health and quality of life.
            (10) Community organizations serving Holocaust survivors 
        report that approximately two-thirds of Holocaust survivors 
        live alone, and living alone is a risk factor for 
        hospitalization and nursing home admission, poverty, falls, 
        depression, poor nutrition, social isolation, and loneliness, 
        which have been associated with poor health outcomes and an 
        increased risk of death.
            (11) According to Findings from the National Jewish 
        Population Survey 2000-01, more than half of all Holocaust 
        survivors who immigrated to the United States from the former 
        Soviet Union after 1965 have annual incomes beneath the Federal 
        poverty threshold and constitute an extremely vulnerable at-
        risk population in the United States.
            (12) Community organizations serving Holocaust survivors 
        report that transportation is vital to help Holocaust survivors 
        attend medical appointments, shop and purchase necessary items, 
        visit family and friends, and participate in cultural, 
        recreational, or social events, such as congregate meals or 
        religious services.
            (13) As the general population of older adults increases 
        and public or philanthropic resources remain constant, 
        providers serving older adults including Holocaust survivors 
        need additional capacity to cover the needed services.
            (14) The Administration for Community Living in the United 
        States Department of Health and Human Services serves as the 
        Federal agency responsible for increasing access to community 
        supports, while focusing attention and resources on the unique 
        needs of older Americans and people with disabilities across 
        the lifespan.
            (15) The Administration for Community Living's mission is 
        to maximize the independence, well-being, and health of older 
        adults, people with disabilities, and their families and 
        caregivers.
            (16) Many social service agencies that receive funding 
        under the Older Americans Act for home-delivered or congregate 
        meals serve diverse seniors with specialized dietary needs 
        based on religious, cultural, or ethnic requirements, and the 
        necessary special meals often cost more than non-special meals.
