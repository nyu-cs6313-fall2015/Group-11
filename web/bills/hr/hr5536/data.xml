Domestic Violence Enhanced Penalty Act of 2014 or Candace's Law - Directs a state to provide by law enhanced sentencing requirements for persons convicted of committing, or attempting to commit, an act of domestic violence in the presence of minor children.

Prohibits a state that fails within two years to implement this Act substantially from receiving 20% of the funds that would otherwise be allocated to it for the fiscal year under the Violence Against Women Act of 2000.

Allows for reasonable alternative procedures or accommodations for compliance by a state that is unable to implement this Act substantially because of a conflict with the state constitution.</summary>
