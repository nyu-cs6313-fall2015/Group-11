(Thus subjects such non-ancillary services to the prohibitions against physician self-referrals).\n\nLists among specified non-ancillary services: (1) anatomic pathology services (including the technical or professional component of surgical pathology, cytopathology, hematology, blood banking, and pathology consultation and clinical laboratory interpretation services), (2) radiation therapy services and supplies, (3) advanced diagnostic imaging studies, and (4) physical therapy services.\n\nIncreases from a maximum of $15,000 to a maximum of $25,000 the civil monetary penalty in the case of a bill or claim for such services whose presenter knows or should have known they are for a service for which payment may not be made.\n\nIncreases from a maximum of $100,000 to a maximum of $150,000 the civil monetary penalty for any circumventive arrangement or scheme which a physician or other entity enters into knowing (or should know) has a principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity which, if the physician directly made referrals to such entity, would be in violation of SSA title XVIII.\n\nDirects the Secretary to review compliance with the self-referral prohibitions with respect to referrals for specified non-ancillary services in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.\n\nStates that, in applying the self-referral prohibitions, the term \"entity\" includes a physician's practice when it bills under Medicare for the technical component or the professional component of a specified non-ancillary service."
