inserting at the end the following:

``SEC. __. DEFINITIONS.

            ``(1) The term `reference DNA sample' means a tissue,

        deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) identification information from a 
        bodily sample.
            ``(3) The term `sample-to-answer DNA analysis systems' 
        means fully automated systems that after input of a DNA sample

        no operator intervention.
            ``(4) The term `qualified agencies' means booking stations, 
        jails, prisons, detention centers, other law enforcement 
        organizations, and facilities outside of forensic laboratories 
        that can perform DNA analysis using sample-to-answer DNA 
        systems on subjects meeting current legislative guidelines.
            ``(5) The term `operators' means persons trained to operate 
        a sample-to-answer DNA system.''.

SEC. 3. REVISED QUALITY ASSURANCE AND PROFICIENCY TESTING STANDARDS.
