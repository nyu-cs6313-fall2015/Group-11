To require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to 
primarily consider, and to separately report, the domestic benefits of 
 any rule that addresses emissions of carbon dioxide from any existing 
 source or new source that is an electric utility generating unit, in 
any such rule, and in the regulatory impact analysis for such rule, and

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``The EPA Regulatory Domestic Benefit 
Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. RULES ADDRESSING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC UTILITY 
              GENERATING UNITS.

    (a)  Consideration of Domestic Benefits.--The Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency may not issue, implement, or enforce 
any proposed or final rule addressing emissions of carbon dioxide from 
any new source or existing source that is an electric utility 
generating unit unless the Administrator in such rule, and in the 
regulatory impact analysis for such rule--
            (1) includes an analysis and an estimate of any domestic 
        benefits of such rule that are reported separately from any 
        analysis or estimate of the global benefits of such rule;
            (2) primarily considers the domestic benefits of such rule 
        as opposed to the global benefits of such rule; and
            (3) includes an estimate of the difference between 
        monetized benefits and costs of such rule that is based on 
        analyses and estimates of domestic benefits and domestic costs.
    (b) Nullification of Proposed Rules.--The following rules of the 
Environmental Protection Agency shall have no force or effect and shall 
be treated as if such rules had never been issued:
            (1) The proposed rule entitled ``Standards of Performance 
        for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New Stationary Sources: 
        Electric Utility Generating Units'' published at 79 Fed. Reg. 
        1430 (January 8, 2014).
            (2) The proposed rule entitled ``Carbon Pollution Emission 
        Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility 
        Generating Units'' published at 79 Fed. Reg. 34830 (June 18, 
        2014).
    (c) Definitions.--In this Act:
            (1) Existing source.--The term ``existing source'' has the 
        meaning given such term in section 111(a) of the Clean Air Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 7411(a)).
            (2) New source.--The term ``new source'' has the meaning 
        given such term in section 111(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 
        U.S.C. 7411(a)).
                                 <all>
