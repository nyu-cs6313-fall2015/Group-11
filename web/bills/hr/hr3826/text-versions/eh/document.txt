                                 AN ACT


 
    To provide direction to the Administrator of the Environmental 
    Protection Agency regarding the establishment of standards for 
emissions of any greenhouse gas from fossil fuel-fired electric utility 
               generating units, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Electricity Security and 
Affordability Act''.

SEC. 2. STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR NEW FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED ELECTRIC 
              UTILITY GENERATING UNITS.

    (a) Limitation.--The Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency may not issue, implement, or enforce any proposed or final rule 
under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411) that 
establishes a standard of performance for emissions of any greenhouse 
gas from any new source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility 
generating unit unless such rule meets the requirements under 
subsections (b) and (c).
    (b) Requirements.--In issuing any rule under section 111 of the 
Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411) establishing standards of performance 
for emissions of any greenhouse gas from new sources that are fossil 
fuel-fired electric utility generating units, the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency (for purposes of establishing such 
standards)--
            (1) shall separate sources fueled with coal and natural gas 
        into separate categories; and
            (2) shall not set a standard based on the best system of 
        emission reduction for new sources within a fossil-fuel 
        category unless--
                    (A) such standard has been achieved on average for 
                at least one continuous 12-month period (excluding 
                planned outages) by each of at least 6 units within 
                such category--
                            (i) each of which is located at a different 
                        electric generating station in the United 
                        States;
                            (ii) which, collectively, are 
                        representative of the operating characteristics 
                        of electric generation at different locations 
                        in the United States; and
                            (iii) each of which is operated for the 
                        entire 12-month period on a full commercial 
                        basis; and
                    (B) no results obtained from any demonstration 
                project are used in setting such standard.
    (c) Coal Having a Heat Content of 8300 or Less British Thermal 
Units Per Pound.--
            (1) Separate subcategory.--In carrying out subsection 
        (b)(1), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency shall establish a separate subcategory for new sources 
        that are fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating units 
        using coal with an average heat content of 8300 or less British 
        Thermal Units per pound.
            (2) Standard.--Notwithstanding subsection (b)(2), in 
        issuing any rule under section 111 of the Clean Air Act (42 
        U.S.C. 7411) establishing standards of performance for 
        emissions of any greenhouse gas from new sources in such 
        subcategory, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency shall not set a standard based on the best system of 
        emission reduction unless--
                    (A) such standard has been achieved on average for 
                at least one continuous 12-month period (excluding 
                planned outages) by each of at least 3 units within 
                such subcategory--
                            (i) each of which is located at a different 
                        electric generating station in the United 
                        States;
                            (ii) which, collectively, are 
                        representative of the operating characteristics 
                        of electric generation at different locations 
                        in the United States; and
                            (iii) each of which is operated for the 
                        entire 12-month period on a full commercial 
                        basis; and
                    (B) no results obtained from any demonstration 
                project are used in setting such standard.
    (d) Technologies.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
preclude the issuance, implementation, or enforcement of a standard of 
performance that--
            (1) is based on the use of one or more technologies that 
        are developed in a foreign country, but has been demonstrated 
        to be achievable at fossil fuel-fired electric utility 
        generating units in the United States; and
            (2) meets the requirements of subsection (b) and (c), as 
        applicable.

SEC. 3. CONGRESS TO SET EFFECTIVE DATE FOR STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR 
              EXISTING, MODIFIED, AND RECONSTRUCTED FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED 
              ELECTRIC UTILITY GENERATING UNITS.

            (1) establish any standard of performance for emissions of 
        any greenhouse gas from any modified or reconstructed source 
        that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility generating unit; 
        or
            (2) apply to the emissions of any greenhouse gas from an 
        existing source that is a fossil fuel-fired electric utility 
        generating unit.
    (b) Congress To Set Effective Date.--A rule or guidelines described 
in subsection (a) shall not take effect unless a Federal law is enacted 
specifying such rule's or guidelines' effective date.

        global greenhouse gas emissions.
    (d) Consultation.--In carrying out subsection (c), the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall consult with 
the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, the 
Comptroller General of the United States, the Director of the National
