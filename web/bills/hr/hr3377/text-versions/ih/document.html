                use (including restoration, preservation, and 
                enhancement) of land and water resources, the State or

                        ephemeral water bodies.
                    ``(G) Prohibition on use of nexus test.--
                Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
                Administrator may not use a significant nexus test (as 
                used by EPA in the proposed document listed in section
