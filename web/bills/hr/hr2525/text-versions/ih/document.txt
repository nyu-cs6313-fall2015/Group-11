                            party entities.

SEC. 2. PAYMENT FOR CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES.

    Section 487(a)(20) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1094(a)(20)) is amended by adding at the end the following: 
``Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an institution described in 
section 101 may provide payment, based on the amount of tuition 
generated by the institution from student enrollment, to a third-party 
entity that provides a set of services to the institution that includes 
student recruitment services, regardless of whether the third-party 
entity is affiliated with an institution that provides educational 
services other than the institution providing such payment, if--
                    ``(A) the third-party entity is not otherwise 
                affiliated with the institution providing such payment;
                    ``(B) the third-party entity does not make 
                compensation payments to its employees that are 
                prohibited under this paragraph;
                    ``(C) the set of services provided to the 
                institution by the third-party entity include services 
                other than student recruitment services, and the 
                institution does not pay the third-party entity solely 
                for student recruitment services provided by the third-
                party entity; and
                    ``(D) any student recruitment information available 
                to the third-party entity, including personally 
                identifiable information, will not be used by, shared 
                with, or sold to any other person or entity, including 
                any institution that is affiliated with the third-party 
                entity.''.
