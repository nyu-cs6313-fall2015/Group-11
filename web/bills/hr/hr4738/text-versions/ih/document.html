SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Tank Car Safety Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. DOT-111 TANK CAR IMPROVEMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall revise regulations 
regarding DOT-111 tank cars to--
            (1) improve such tank car design standards for new cars to 
        include an outer steel jacket around the tank car and thermal 
        protection, full-height head shields and high-flow capacity 
        pressure relief valves; and
            (2) require additional safety upgrades to tank cars built 
        after October 2011 by including installation of high-flow-
        capacity relief valves and design modifications to prevent 
        bottom outlets from opening in the case of an accident.
    (b) Phase Out Plan.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall submit a 
plan to the appropriate committees of Congress to phase out, on an 
aggressive basis, older-model DOT-111 tank cars used to move flammable 
liquids that are not retrofitted to meet new Federal requirements 
established under this section.
