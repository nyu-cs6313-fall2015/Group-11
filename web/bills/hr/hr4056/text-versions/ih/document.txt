                                 A BILL


 
   To reduce the operation and maintenance costs associated with the 
 Federal fleet by encouraging the use of remanufactured parts, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings 
Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that in March 2013 the Government Accountability 
Office issued a report that confirmed the following:
            (1) There are approximately 588,000 vehicles in the 
        civilian Federal fleet.
            (2) Federal agencies spent approximately $975 million on 
        repair and maintenance of these vehicles in 2011.
            (3) Remanufactured vehicle components, such as engines, 
        starters, alternators, steering racks, and clutches, tend to be 
        less expensive than comparable new replacement parts.
            (4) The United States Postal Service and United States 
        Department of the Interior both informed the Government 
        Accountability Office that they rely on the use of 
        remanufactured vehicle components to reduce costs.

SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO USE REMANUFACTURED VEHICLE COMPONENTS.

    (a) Requirement.--The head of each Federal agency shall encourage 
the use of remanufactured vehicle components to maintain Federal 
vehicles, if using such components reduces the cost while maintaining 
quality, but not if using such components--
            (1) does not reduce the cost;
            (2) lowers the quality of vehicle performance, as 
        determined by the employee of the Federal agency responsible 
        for the repair decision; or
            (3) delays the return to service of a vehicle.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal agency'' has the 
        meaning given that term in section 102 of title 40, United 
        States Code.
            (2) Remanufactured vehicle component.--The term 
        ``remanufactured vehicle component'' means a vehicle component 
        (including an engine, transmission, alternator, starter, 
        turbocharger, steering, or suspension component) that has been 
        returned to same-as-new, or better, condition and performance 
        by a standardized industrial process that incorporates 
        technical specifications (including engineering, quality, and 
        testing standards) to yield fully warranted products.
                                 <all>
