                                 A BILL


 
    To prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from asking taxpayers 
      questions regarding religious, political, or social beliefs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Taxpayers from Intrusive 
IRS Requests Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON QUESTIONS REGARDING RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, OR 
              SOCIAL BELIEFS.

    (a) In General.--The Internal Revenue Service shall not ask any 
taxpayer any question regarding religious, political, or social 
beliefs.
    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Exceptions.--It is the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) any exceptions to subsection (a) which are provided by 
        later enacted provisions of law should identify the specific 
        questions which are authorized, the class of taxpayers to which 
        such questions are authorized to be asked, and the 
        circumstances under which such questions are authorized to be 
        asked, and
            (2) if the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service 
        determines that asking any class of taxpayers a question 
        prohibited under subsection (a) would aid in the efficient 
        administration of the tax laws, such Commissioner should submit 
        a report to Congress which--
                    (A) includes such question in the verbatim form in 
                which it is to be asked,
                    (B) describes the class of taxpayers to whom the 
                question is to be asked, and
                    (C) describes the circumstances that would be 
                required to exist before the question would be asked.
                                 <all>
