                In the case of a member described in paragraph (1), the 
                Secretary concerned shall pay an annuity under this 
                subchapter to the member's dependent children under 
                section 1450(a)(2) of this title as applicable.

                children under section 1450(a)(3) of this title, if 
                applicable, instead of paying an annuity to the 
                surviving spouse under paragraph (1), if the Secretary 
                concerned, in consultation with the surviving spouse, 
                determines it appropriate to provide an annuity for the 
                dependent children under this paragraph instead of an 
                annuity for the surviving spouse under paragraph 
                (1).''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

        November 23, 2003, when no other annuity is payable on behalf 
        of the member under this subchapter.''.

                enactment of this section to be adjusted to reflect the 
                amendments made by this section; and
                    (B) provide a lump-sum payment to cover the period 
                between the death of the member concerned (or October 
                1, 2008, if later than that date in the case of the 
                special survivor indemnity allowance) and the date the
