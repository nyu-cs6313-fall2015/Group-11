SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Iran's acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability 
        would--
                    (A) embolden its already aggressive foreign policy, 
                including its arming of terrorist organizations and 
                other groups, its efforts to destabilize countries in 
                the Middle East, and its efforts to target the United 
                States, United States allies, and United States 
                interests globally;
                    (B) increase the risk that Iran would share its 
                nuclear technology and expertise with extremist groups 
                and rogue nations;
                    (C) destabilize global energy markets, posing a 
                direct and devastating threat to the American and 
                global economy; and
                    (D) likely lead other governments in the region to 
                pursue their own nuclear weapons programs, increasing 
                the prospect of nuclear proliferation throughout the 
                region and effectively ending the viability of the 
                global nonproliferation regime, including the Treaty on 
                the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
            (2) A nuclear arms-capable Iran possessing intercontinental 
        ballistic missiles, a development most experts expect could 
        occur within a decade, would pose a direct nuclear threat to 
        the United States.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.

SEC. 204. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Government of Iran, its agencies and 
        instrumentalities, continue to have access to, and utilize, 
        euro-denominated transactions, including for goods and services 
        that are subject to sanctions imposed by the United States, the 
        European Union and its member states and by the United Nations.
            (2) The Guidelines of the European Central Bank (Article 
        39(1)) states that: ``Participants shall be deemed to be aware 
        of, and shall comply with, all obligations on them relating to 
        legislation on data protection, prevention of money laundering 
        and the financing of terrorism, proliferation-sensitive nuclear 
        activities and the development of nuclear weapons delivery 
        systems, in particular in terms of implementing appropriate 
        measures concerning any payments debited or credited on their 
        PM accounts.''
            (3) United States and European convergence with respect to 
        United States sanctions efforts toward the Iranian regime is a 
        vital component of United States policy aimed at preventing the 
        Iranian regime from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
President should closely coordinate and cooperate with the European 
Union and its member states to restrict access and use of the euro 
currency by the Government of Iran, its agencies and instrumentalities, 
for transactions (with the exception of food, medicine, medical devices 
and other humanitarian goods), including through the payment systems of 
the European Central Bank, such as its second generation Trans-European 
Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer System, and local 
and regional Euro settlement platforms.
