To direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a pilot program to award 
 grants and loan guarantees to hospitals to carry out projects for the 
 purpose of reducing energy costs and increasing resilience to improve 
                               security.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Hospital Energy Conservation Act''.

SEC. 2. ENERGY CONSERVATION GRANT AND LOAN GUARANTEE PILOT PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Energy shall establish a pilot 
program to award grants and loan guarantees to hospitals to carry out 
energy conservation projects for the purpose of--
            (1) significantly improving the energy efficiency of such 
        hospitals; and
            (2) encouraging onsite power generation and energy storage, 
        capable of operating independent of the grid, and providing 
        sufficient onsite emergency backup power for essential hospital 
        functions.
    (b) Number of Hospitals.--The Secretary shall award grants and loan 
guarantees under the pilot program to no more than 6 hospitals during 
the period described in subsection (f).
    (c) Applications.--A hospital seeking a grant or loan guarantee 
under the pilot program shall submit an application to the Secretary at 
such time, in such manner, and accompanied by such information as the 
Secretary may require.
    (d) Considerations.--In selecting a hospital to award a grant or 
loan guarantee to under the pilot program, the Secretary shall give 
special consideration to applications from such hospitals that can 
demonstrate that they are able to commence an energy conservation 
project more promptly.
    (e) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``hospital'' and 
``energy conservation project'' have the meanings given such terms in 
section 391 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6371).
    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated for carrying out this section such sums as may be 
necessary for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, to be derived from funds 
otherwise authorized to be appropriated for related purposes.
                                 <all>
