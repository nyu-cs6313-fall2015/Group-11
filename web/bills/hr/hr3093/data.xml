  <summary>9/12/2013--Introduced.
Union Bailout Prevention Act of 2013 - Declares that no refundable premium assistance tax credits (subsidies) for coverage under a qualified health plan under the Internal Revenue Code, or reductions in cost-sharing under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), shall be permitted with respect to an individual for health insurance coverage provided pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement involving one or more employers (collectively bargained plan).

Amends PPACA to exclude collectively bargained plans from the meaning of "qualified health plan."</summary>
