                                 A BILL


 
   To safeguard military and civilian personnel on military bases by 
 repealing bans on military personnel carrying firearms, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Military Bases Act''.

SEC. 2. REPEAL OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS DISARMING FIREARMS-TRAINED 
              MILITARY PERSONNEL AND PROHIBITION ON REIMPOSING BANS ON 
              MILITARY PERSONNEL CARRYING FIREARMS.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``firearms'' means only handguns.
            (2) The term ``military personnel'' means all members of 
        the Armed Forces who are trained by the Armed Forces in the use 
        of firearms.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In both the Fort Hood and Navy Yard shootings, military 
        personnel unable to carry firearms by the military gun bans 
        were unable to stop the shooters.
            (2) Military personnel are trained in firearms use and are 
        prepared to protect and defend the United States at all times.
            (3) Military personnel are entrusted with firearms and 
        other weapons in the defense of the United States.
            (4) Gun free zones attract mass-murderers. The Aurora, 
        Colorado, shooter selected the single theater in the area that 
        banned concealed-carry.
            (5) Following the Fort Hood terrorist attack, the world--
        including the Navy Yard shooter--learned that post-gun-ban 
        military bases are inadequately defended targets. Such 
        shootings may happen again as long as military personnel are 
        disarmed.
    (c) Repeal of Laws and Regulations Disarming Firearms-Trained 
Military Personnel.--
            (1) Repeal.--Effective on the date of the enactment of this 
        Act--
                    (A) Army Regulation 190-14, issued on March 12, 
                1993, is repealed; and
                    (B) Department of Defense Directive Number 5210.56, 
                issued on November 1, 2001, as modified on January 24, 
                2002, and by any subsequent modification, is repealed.
            (2) Effect of other firearm bans.--Effective on the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, any provision in any other law, 
        rule, regulation, or Executive order that prohibits military 
        personnel trained in firearms from carrying officially issued 
        or personally owned firearms on military bases shall have no 
        force or effect with regard to such military personnel, and 
        such military personnel shall not be prohibited from carrying 
        officially issued or personally owned firearms on military 
        bases. This paragraph includes the relevant provisions in 
        section 1585 of title 10, United States Code (relating to 
        carrying of firearms), section 922 of title 18, United States 
        Code (relating to unlawful acts), and part 108.11 of title 14, 
        Code of Federal Regulations (relating to carriage of weapons).
    (d) Prohibition on Military Personnel Gun Bans.--
            (1) Department of defense.--The Secretary of Defense and 
        the Secretaries of the military departments shall not reinstate 
        the firearm bans referred to in subsection (c) or enact similar 
        restrictions prohibiting or restricting military personnel from 
        carrying firearms.
            (2) President.--The President shall not take any executive 
        action or promulgate any rule or issue any Executive order or 
        regulation to prohibit military personnel from carrying 
        firearms.
    (e) Reporting Requirement.--The Secretary of Defense shall submit 
to Congress, not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, a report describing the actions taken to ensure compliance 
with this section.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
