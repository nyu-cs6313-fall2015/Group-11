_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
         To provide for a Youth Mental Health Research Network.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Mental Health Research Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) More than 100 million Americans currently have some 
        sort of brain-related condition. Millions of Americans, many of 
        whom are currently school children, have some sort of 
        developmental delay, autism, or learning disability.
            (2) Moreover, many Americans suffer from some form of 
        psychotic disorder, including schizophrenia and affective 
        psychotic disorders.
            (3) These brain disorders usually result in significant 
        life-long disability, and psychotic disorders in particular, 
        despite advances in treatment, rank among the top causes of 
        disability worldwide.
            (4) Neuroscience research has the potential to dramatically 
        improve the quality of life for people facing brain disease and 
        injury, and to significantly improve our understanding of 
        learning.
            (5) Because of the impact on the health and economy of the 
        country, the Federal Government has taken a special interest in 
        promoting neuroscience and mental health research. Several 
        Federal agencies, including the National Science Foundation, 
        National Institutes of Health (NIH), Veterans Administration, 
        and Department of Defense oversee research on the brain and 
        nervous system.
            (6) In December 2011, Congress directed the Office of 
        Science and Technology Policy to establish an Interagency 
        Working Group on Neuroscience (IWGN). The IWGN is currently 
        convening representatives across the Federal Government to make 
        recommendations about the future of neuroscience research.
            (7) Given the findings about the role of mental illness in 
        multiple shootings across the Nation, including Newton, 
        Connecticut, Aurora, Colorado, and other communities 
        experiencing similar tragedies, the Federal Government has an 
        interest in pursuing research on the early detection, 
        intervention, and prevention of psychosis.
            (8) In line with this, the Federal Government is looking 
        for new ways of increasing the Nation's knowledge of the 
        underlying causes of psychosis.
            (9) The United States commitment to furthering the early 
        detection of mental illness in youth was seen in its 
        participation in two public/private research programs that 
        studied the earliest stages of psychotic illness, namely--
                    (A) the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 
                (NAPLS); and
                    (B) the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia 
                Episode (RAISE) initiative.
