Requires the Director to ensure that an appropriate number of awards go to entities that agree to: (1) focus primarily on the early detection and intervention of severe mental illness in young people; (2) conduct or coordinate multisite clinical trials of therapies for, or approaches to, the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of early severe mental illness in a community setting; (3) disseminate scientific findings; and (4) adhere to the guidelines, protocols, and practices used in the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) initiative.
