    acquiring any parcels proposed for acquisition, the basis for the 
    estimate, and a statement on the relative priority for the 
    acquisition of each parcel within the priorities for acquisition of 
    other parcels for the System unit and for the System.
  (c) Minor Boundary Changes.--
      (1) In general.--When the Secretary determines that to do so will

    Secretary's intention to do so, and by publication of a revised 
    boundary map or other description in the Federal Register--
          (A) make minor changes to the boundary of the System unit, 
        and amounts appropriated from the Fund shall be available for 
        acquisition of any land, water, and interests in land or water 
        added to the System unit by the boundary change subject to such 
        statutory limitations, if any, on methods of acquisition and 
        appropriations thereof as may be specifically applicable to the 
        System unit; and
          (B) acquire by donation, purchase with donated funds, 
        transfer from any other Federal agency, or exchange, land, 
        water, or interests in land or water adjacent to the System 
        unit, except that in exercising the Secretary's authority under

            the System to acquire land by exchange;
              (ii) shall not acquire property without the consent of 
            the owner; and
              (iii) may acquire property owned by a State or political 
            subdivision of a State only by donation.
      (2) Consultation.--Prior to making a determination under this 
    subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the governing body of 
    the county, city, town, or other jurisdiction or jurisdictions 
    having primary taxing authority over the land or interest to be 
    acquired as to the impacts of the proposed action.
      (3) Action to advance local public awareness.--The Secretary 
    shall take such steps as the Secretary considers appropriate to 
    advance local public awareness of the proposed action.
      (4) Administration of acquisitions.--Land, water, and interests 
    in land or water acquired in accordance with this subsection shall 
    be administered as part of the System unit to which they are added, 
    subject to the laws and regulations applicable to the System unit.
      (5) When authority applies.--For the purposes of paragraph 
    (1)(A), in all cases except the case of technical boundary changes 
    (resulting from such causes as survey error or changed road 
    alignments), the authority of the Secretary under paragraph (1)(A) 
    shall apply only if each of the following conditions is met:
          (A) The sum of the total acreage of the land, water, and 
        interests in land or water to be added to the System unit and 
        the total acreage of the land, water, and interests in land or 
        water to be deleted from the System unit is not more than 5 
        percent of the total Federal acreage authorized to be included 
        in the System unit and is less than 200 acres.
          (B) The acquisition, if any, is not a major Federal action 
        significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, 
        as determined by the Secretary.
          (C) The sum of the total appraised value of the land, water, 
        and interests in land or water to be added to the System unit 
        and the total appraised value of the land, water, and interests 
        in land or water to be deleted from the System unit does not 
        exceed $750,000.
          (D) The proposed boundary change is not an element of a more 
        comprehensive boundary change proposal.
          (E) The proposed boundary has been subject to a public review 
        and comment period.
          (F) The Director obtains written consent for the boundary 
        change from all property owners whose land, water, or interests 
        in land or water, or a portion of whose land, water, or 
        interests in land or water, will be added to or deleted from 
        the System unit by the boundary change.
          (G) The land abuts other Federal land administered by the 
        Director.
      (6) Act of congress required.--Minor boundary changes involving 
    only deletions of acreage owned by the Federal Government and 
    administered by the Service may be made only by Act of Congress.

Sec. 100507. Additional areas for System

        feasibility;
          (B) themes, sites, and resources not already adequately 
        represented in the System; and
          (C) public petitions and Congressional resolutions.

          Subchapter III--Mining Activity Within System Units

Sec. 100731. Findings and declaration

  Congress finds and declares that--
      (1) the level of technology of mineral exploration and 
    development has changed radically, and continued application of the 
    mining laws of the United States to System units to which the 
    mining laws apply conflicts with the purposes for which the System 
    units were established; and
      (2) all mining operations in System units should be conducted so 
    as to prevent or minimize damage to the environment and other 
    resource values.

Sec. 100732. Preservation and management of System units by Secretary;

indiscriminate use, so that--
      (1) visitation will not unduly impair those resources and values; 
    and
      (2) development of public accommodations, facilities, and 
    services within System units can best be limited to locations that 
    are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the 
    preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the 
    System units.
  (b) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of Congress that the 
development of public accommodations, facilities, and services in 
System units shall be limited to accommodations, facilities, and 
services that--
      (1) are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of

    preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the

            facilities and services to the public at reasonable rates.

            corporation, or entity submitting the proposal, including

                than a capital improvement constructed by a 
                concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession 
                contract prior to November 13, 1998, or constructed or 
                owned by a concessioner or the concessioner's 
                predecessor before the subject land was incorporated 
                into the System;
                  (II) the Secretary determines that the concessioner

        the Secretary estimates will result in gross annual receipts of 
        less than $500,000 if renewed shall be entitled to a 
        preferential right of renewal under this subchapter if--

    preferential right to a concessioner to provide new or additional 
    services in a System unit.
      (10) Authority of secretary not limited.--Nothing in this 
    subchapter shall be construed as limiting the authority of the

    establish its terms and conditions in furtherance of the policies 
    expressed in this subchapter.
      (11) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding this section, the Secretary may 
    award, without public solicitation, the following:
          (A) Temporary contract.--To avoid interruption of services to 
        the public at a System unit, the Secretary may award a 
        temporary concession contract or an extension of an existing

        that prior to making the award, the Secretary shall take all 
        reasonable and appropriate steps to consider alternatives to 
        avoid the interruption.
          (B) Contract in extraordinary circumstances.--The Secretary 
        may award a concession contract in extraordinary circumstances 
        where compelling and equitable considerations require the award 
        of a concession contract to a particular party in the public 
        interest. Award of a concession contract under this 
        subparagraph shall not be made by the Secretary until at least 
        30 days after--
              (i) publication in the Federal Register of notice of the 
            Secretary's intention to award the contract and the reasons 
            for the action; and

  A concession contract entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall 
generally be awarded for a term of 10 years or less. The Secretary may 
award a contract for a term of up to 20 years if the Secretary

required construction of capital improvements, warrant a longer term.

Sec. 101915. Protection of concessioner investment

  (a) Definitions.--In this section:
      (1) Capital improvement.--The term ``capital improvement'' means 
    a structure, a fixture, or nonremovable equipment provided by a 
    concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession contract and 
    located on land of the United States within a System unit.
      (2) Consumer price index.--The term ``Consumer Price Index'' 
    means--
          (A) the ``Consumer Price Index--All Urban Consumers'' 
        published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department 
        of Labor; or
          (B) if the Index is not published, another regularly 
        published cost-of-living index approximating the Consumer Price 
        Index.
  (b) Leasehold Surrender Interest in Capital Improvements.--A 
concessioner that constructs a capital improvement on land owned by the 
United States within a System unit pursuant to a concession contract 
shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement 
subject to the following terms and conditions:
      (1) In general.--A concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender 
    interest in each capital improvement constructed by a concessioner 
    under a concession contract, consisting solely of a right to 
    compensation for the capital improvement to the extent of the value 
    of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest in the capital 
    improvement.
      (2) Pledge as security.--A leasehold surrender interest may be 
    pledged as security for financing of a capital improvement or the 
    acquisition of a concession contract when approved by the Secretary 
    pursuant to this subchapter.
      (3) Transfer and relinquishment or waiver of interest.--A 
    leasehold surrender interest shall be transferred by the 
    concessioner in connection with any transfer of the concession 
    contract and may be relinquished or waived by the concessioner.
      (4) Limit on extinguishing or taking interest.--A leasehold 
    surrender interest shall not be extinguished by the expiration or 
    other termination of a concession contract and may not be taken for 
    public use except on payment of just compensation.
      (5) Value of interest.--The value of a leasehold surrender 
    interest in a capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the 
    initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), 
    increased (or decreased) by the same percentage increase (or 
    decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Consumer 
    Price Index, from the date of making the investment in the capital 
    improvement by the concessioner to the date of payment of the value 
    of the leasehold surrender interest, less depreciation of the 
    capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective 
    serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind.
      (6) Value of interest in certain new concession contracts.--
          (A) How value is determined.--The Secretary may provide, in 
        any new concession contract that the Secretary estimates will 
        have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, 
        that the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital 
        improvement shall be based on--
              (i) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, 
            over the same number of years as the time period associated 
            with the straight line depreciation of the initial value 
            (construction cost of the capital improvement), as provided 
            by applicable Federal income tax laws and regulations in 
            effect on November 12, 1998; or
              (ii) an alternative formula that is consistent with the 
            objectives of this subchapter.
          (B) When alternative formula may be used.--The Secretary may 
        use an alternative formula under subparagraph (A)(ii) only if 
        the Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and 
        other circumstances involved in the particular concession 
        contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register 
        and opportunity for comment), that the alternative formula is, 
        compared to the standard method of determining value provided 
        for in paragraph (5), necessary to provide a fair return to the 
        Federal Government and to foster competition for the new 
        contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to make a profit 
        under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received in 
        response to a solicitation that includes the alternative 
        formula, the concession opportunity shall be resolicited with 
        the leasehold surrender interest value as described in 
        paragraph (5).
      (7) Increase in value of interest.--Where a concessioner, 
    pursuant to the terms of a concession contract, makes a capital 
    improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the 
    concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the cost of the 
    additional capital improvement shall be added to the then-current 
    value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.
  (c) Special Rule for Possessory Interest Existing Before November 13, 
1998.--
      (1) In general.--A concessioner that has obtained a possessory 
    interest (as defined pursuant to the Act of October 9, 1965 (known 
    as the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act; Public Law 89-
    249, 79 Stat. 969), as in effect on November 12, 1998) under the 
    terms of a concession contract entered into before November 13, 
    1998, shall, on the expiration or termination of the concession 
    contract, be entitled to receive compensation for the possessory 
    interest improvements in the amount and manner as described by the 
    concession contract. Where that possessory interest is not 
    described in the existing concession contract, compensation of 
    possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with the laws 
    in effect on November 12, 1998.
      (2) Existing concessioner awarded a new contract.--A concessioner 
    awarded a new concession contract to replace an existing concession 
    contract after November 13, 1998, instead of directly receiving the 
    possessory interest compensation, shall have a leasehold surrender 
    interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the 
    terms of the new concession contract and shall carry over as the 
    initial value of the leasehold surrender interest (instead of 
    construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing 
    possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous 
    concession contract. In the event of a dispute between the 
    concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of the possessory 
    interest, the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration.
      (3) New concessioner awarded a contract.--A new concessioner 
    awarded a concession contract and required to pay a prior 
    concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements shall 
    have a leasehold surrender interest in the prior improvements. The 
    initial value in the leasehold surrender interest (instead of 
    construction cost) shall be an amount equal to the value of the 
    existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the 
    previous concession contract.
      (4) De novo review of value determination.--If the Secretary, or 
    either party to a value determination proceeding conducted under a 
    Service concession contract issued before November 13, 1998, 
    considers that the value determination decision issued pursuant to 
    the proceeding misinterprets or misapplies relevant contractual 
    requirements or their underlying legal authority, the Secretary or 
    either party may seek, within 180 days after the date of the 
    decision, de novo review of the value determination decision by the 
    United States Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims 
    may make an order affirming, vacating, modifying or correcting the 
    determination decision.
  (d) Transition to Successor Concessioner.--On expiration or 
termination of a concession contract entered into after November 13, 
1998, a concessioner shall be entitled under the terms of the 
concession contract to receive from the United States or a successor 
concessioner the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital 
improvement as of the date of the expiration or termination. A 
successor concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in the 
capital improvement under the terms of a new concession contract and 
the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest in the capital 
improvement (instead of construction cost) shall be the amount of money 
the new concessioner is required to pay the prior concessioner for its 
leasehold surrender interest under the terms of the prior concession 
contract.
  (e) Title to Improvements.--Title to any capital improvement 
constructed by a concessioner on land owned by the United States in a 
System unit shall be vested in the United States.

Sec. 101916. Reasonableness of rates and charges

  (a) In General.--A concession contract shall permit the concessioner 
to set reasonable and appropriate rates and charges for facilities, 
goods, and services provided to the public, subject to approval under 
subsection (b).
  (b) Approval by Secretary Required.--
      (1) Factors to consider.--A concessioner's rates and charges to 
    the public shall be subject to approval by the Secretary. The 
    approval process utilized by the Secretary shall be as prompt and 
    as unburdensome to the concessioner as possible and shall rely on 
    market forces to establish reasonableness of rates and charges to 
    the maximum extent practicable. The Secretary shall approve rates 
    and charges that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and 
    appropriate. Unless otherwise provided in the concession contract, 
    the reasonableness and appropriateness of rates and charges shall 
    be determined primarily by comparison with those rates and charges 
    for facilities, goods, and services of comparable character under 
    similar conditions, with due consideration to the following factors 
    and other factors deemed relevant by the Secretary:
          (A) Length of season.
          (B) Peakloads.
          (C) Average percentage of occupancy.
          (D) Accessibility.
          (E) Availability and costs of labor and materials.
          (F) Type of patronage.
      (2) Rates and charges not to exceed market rates and charges.--
    Rates and charges may not exceed the market rates and charges for 
    comparable facilities, goods, and services, after taking into 
    account the factors referred to in paragraph (1).
  (c) Implementation of Recommendations.--Not later than 6 months after 
receiving recommendations from the Advisory Board regarding 
concessioner rates and charges to the public, the Secretary shall 
implement the recommendations or report to Congress the reasons for not 
implementing the recommendations.

Sec. 101917. Franchise fees

  (a) In General.--A concession contract shall provide for payment to 
the Federal Government of a franchise fee or other monetary 
consideration as determined by the Secretary, on consideration of the 
probable value to the concessioner of the privileges granted by the 
particular contract involved. Probable value shall be based on a 
reasonable opportunity for net profit in relation to capital invested 
and the obligations of the concession contract. Consideration of 
revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of 
protecting and preserving System units and of providing necessary and 
appropriate services for visitors at reasonable rates.
  (b) Provisions To Be Specified in Contract.--The amount of the 
franchise fee or other monetary consideration paid to the United States 
for the term of the concession contract shall be specified in the 
concession contract and may be modified only to reflect extraordinary 
unanticipated changes from the conditions anticipated as of the 
effective date of the concession contract. The Secretary shall include 
in concession contracts with a term of more than 5 years a provision 
that allows reconsideration of the franchise fee at the request of the 
Secretary or the concessioner in the event of extraordinary 
unanticipated changes. The provision shall provide for binding 
arbitration in the event that the Secretary and the concessioner are 
unable to agree on an adjustment to the franchise fee in those 
circumstances.
  (c) Special Account in Treasury.--
      (1) Deposit and availability.--All franchise fees (and other 
    monetary consideration) paid to the United States pursuant to 
    concession contracts shall be deposited in a special account 
    established in the Treasury. Twenty percent of the funds deposited 
    in the special account shall be available for expenditure by the 
    Secretary, without further appropriation, to support activities 
    throughout the System regardless of the System unit in which the 
    funds were collected. The funds deposited in the special account 
    shall remain available until expended.
      (2) Subaccount for each system unit.--There shall be established 
    within the special account a subaccount for each System unit. Each 
    subaccount shall be credited with 80 percent of the franchise fees 
    (and other monetary consideration) collected at a single System 
    unit under concession contracts. The funds credited to the 
    subaccount for a System unit shall be available for expenditure by 
    the Secretary, without further appropriation, for use at the System 
    unit for visitor services and for purposes of funding high-priority 
    and urgently necessary resource management programs and operations. 
    The funds credited to a subaccount shall remain available until 
    expended.

Sec. 101918. Transfer or conveyance of concession contracts or 
            leasehold surrender interests

  (a) Approval of Secretary.--No concession contract or leasehold 
surrender interest may be transferred, assigned, sold, or otherwise 
conveyed or pledged by a concessioner without prior written 
notification to, and approval by, the Secretary.
  (b) Conditions.--The Secretary shall approve a transfer or conveyance 
described in subsection (a) unless the Secretary finds that--
      (1) the individual, corporation, or other entity seeking to 
    acquire a concession contract is not qualified or able to satisfy 
    the terms and conditions of the concession contract;
      (2) the transfer or conveyance would have an adverse impact on--
          (A) the protection, conservation, or preservation of the 
        resources of the System unit; or
          (B) the provision of necessary and appropriate facilities and 
        services to visitors at reasonable rates and charges; and
      (3) the terms of the transfer or conveyance are likely, directly 
    or indirectly, to--
          (A) reduce the concessioner's opportunity for a reasonable 
        profit over the remaining term of the concession contract;
          (B) adversely affect the quality of facilities and services 
        provided by the concessioner; or
          (C) result in a need for increased rates and charges to the 
        public to maintain the quality of the facilities and services.
  (c) Modification or Renegotiation of Terms.--The terms and conditions 
of any concession contract under this section shall not be subject to 
modification or open to renegotiation by the Secretary because of a 
transfer or conveyance described in subsection (a) unless the transfer 
or conveyance would have an adverse impact as described in subsection 
(b)(2).

    right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be 
    infringed''.
      (2) Section 2.4(a)(1) of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, 
    provides that ``except as otherwise provided in this section and 
    parts 7 (special regulations) and 13 (Alaska regulations), the 
    following are prohibited: (i) Possessing a weapon, trap or net (ii) 
    Carrying a weapon, trap or net (iii) Using a weapon, trap or net''.
      (3) The regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent 
    individuals complying with Federal and State laws from exercising 
    the 2d amendment rights of the individuals while at System units.
      (4) The existence of different laws relating to the 
    transportation and possession of firearms at different System units 
    entrapped law-abiding gun owners while at System units.
      (5) Although the Bush administration issued new regulations 
    relating to the 2d amendment rights of law-abiding citizens in 
    System units that went into effect on January 9, 2009--
          (A) on March 19, 2009, the United States District Court for 
        the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction with 
        respect to the implementation and enforcement of the new 
        regulations; and
          (B) the new regulations--
              (i) are under review by the Obama administration; and
              (ii) may be altered.
      (6) Congress needs to weigh in on the new regulations to ensure 
    that unelected bureaucrats and judges cannot again override the 2d 
    amendment rights of law-abiding citizens on 83,600,000 acres of 
    System land.
      (7) Federal laws should make it clear that the 2d amendment 
    rights of an individual at a System unit should not be infringed.
  (b) Protection of Right of Individuals To Bear Arms in System 
Units.--The Secretary shall not promulgate or enforce any regulation 
that prohibits an individual from possessing a firearm, including an 
assembled or functional firearm, in any System unit if--
      (1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from 
    possessing the firearm; and
      (2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the law 
    of the State in which the System unit is located.

  (a) Authority of Secretary To Make Payments.--The Secretary may

State purposes. Payments may be made to the States by the Secretary as 
provided in this section, subject to such terms and conditions as the 
Secretary considers appropriate and in the public interest to carry out 
the purposes of this chapter, for outdoor recreation:
      (1) Planning.
      (2) Acquisition of land, water, or interests in land or water.
      (3) Development.
  (b) Apportionment Among States.--Amounts appropriated and available

States by the Secretary, whose determination shall be final, in 
accordance with the following formula:
      (1) Forty percent of the 1st $225,000,000; 30 percent of the next 
    $275,000,000; and 20 percent of all additional appropriations shall 
    be apportioned equally among the States.
      (2) At any time, the remaining appropriation shall be apportioned 
    on the basis of need to individual States by the Secretary in such 
    amounts as in the Secretary's judgment will best accomplish the 
    purposes of this chapter. The determination of need shall include 
    consideration of---
          (A) the proportion that the population of each State bears to 
        the total population of the United States;
          (B) the use of outdoor recreation resources of each State by 
        persons from outside the State; and
          (C) the Federal resources and programs in each State.
      (3) The total allocation to a State under paragraphs (1) and (2)

      (4) The Secretary shall notify each State of its apportionments. 
    The amounts shall be available for payment to the State for 
    planning, acquisition, or development projects as prescribed. Any 
    amount of any apportionment that has not been paid or obligated by 
    the Secretary during the fiscal year in which the notification is 
    given and for 2 fiscal years thereafter shall be reapportioned by 
    the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2) without regard to 
    the 10 percent limitation to an individual State specified in this 
    subsection.
      (5) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the District of Columbia, 
    Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the 
    Northern Mariana Islands shall be deemed to be one State, and shall 
    receive shares of the apportionment in proportion to their 
    populations.
  (c) Matching Requirements.--Payments to any State shall cover not 
more than 50 percent of the cost of planning, acquisition, or 
development projects that are undertaken by the State. The remaining 
share of the cost shall be borne by the State in a manner and with 
funds or services as shall be satisfactory to the Secretary.
  (d) Comprehensive State Plan.--
      (1) Required for consideration of financial assistance.--A 
    comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan shall be required 
    prior to the consideration by the Secretary of financial assistance 
    for acquisition or development projects. The plan shall be adequate 
    if, in the judgment of the Secretary, it encompasses and will 
    promote the purposes of this chapter. No plan shall be approved 
    unless the chief executive official of the State certifies that 
    ample opportunity for public participation in plan development and 
    revision has been accorded. The Secretary shall develop, in 
    consultation with others, criteria for public participation, which 
    criteria shall constitute the basis for the certification by the 
    chief executive official. The plan shall contain--
          (A) the name of the State agency that will have authority to 
        represent and act for the State in dealing with the Secretary 
        for purposes of this chapter;
          (B) an evaluation of the demand for and supply of outdoor 
        recreation resources and facilities in the State;
          (C) a program for the implementation of the plan; and
          (D) other necessary information, as determined by the 
        Secretary.
      (2) Factors to be considered.--The plan shall take into account 
    relevant Federal resources and programs and shall be correlated so 
    far as practicable with other State, regional, and local plans. 
    Where there exists or is in preparation for any particular State a 
    comprehensive plan financed in part with funds supplied by the 
    Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, any statewide outdoor 
    recreation plan prepared for purposes of this part shall be based 
    on the same population, growth, and other pertinent factors as are 
    used in formulating plans financed by the Secretary of Housing and 
    Urban Development.
      (3) Provision of assistance when plan not otherwise available or 
    to maintain plan.--The Secretary may provide financial assistance 
    to any State for projects for the preparation of a comprehensive 
    statewide outdoor recreation plan when the plan is not otherwise 
    available or for the maintenance of the plan.
      (4) Wetlands.--A comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan 
    shall specifically address wetlands within the State as an 
    important outdoor recreation resource as a prerequisite to 
    approval, except that a revised comprehensive statewide outdoor 
    recreation plan shall not be required by the Secretary, if a State 
    submits, and the Secretary, acting through the Director, approves, 
    as a part of and as an addendum to the existing comprehensive 
    statewide outdoor recreation plan, a wetlands priority plan 
    developed in consultation with the State agency with responsibility 
    for fish and wildlife resources and consistent with the national 
    wetlands priority conservation plan developed under section 301 of 
    the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 3921) or, 
    if the national plan has not been completed, consistent with the 
    provisions of that section.
  (e) Projects for Land and Water Acquisition and Development of Basic 
Outdoor Recreation Facilities.--
      (1) In general.--In addition to assistance for planning projects, 
    the Secretary may provide financial assistance to any State for the 
    types of projects described in paragraphs (2) and (3), or 
    combinations of those projects, if the projects are in accordance 
    with the State comprehensive plan.
      (2) Acquisition of land or water.--
          (A) In general.--Under paragraph (1), the Secretary may 
        provide financial assistance for a project for the acquisition 
        of land, water, or an interest in land or water, or a wetland 
        area or an interest in a wetland area, as identified in the 
        wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan (other than land, 
        water, or an interest in land or water acquired from the United 
        States for less than fair market value), but not including 
        incidental costs relating to acquisition.
          (B) Retention of right of use and occupancy.--When a State 
        provides that the owner of a single-family residence may, at 
        the owner's option, elect to retain a right of use and 
        occupancy for not less than 6 months after the date of 
        acquisition of the residence and the owner elects to retain 
        such a right--
              (i) the owner shall be deemed to have waived any benefits 
            under sections 203 to 206 of the Uniform Relocation 
            Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 
            1970 (42 U.S.C. 4623 to 4626); and
              (ii) for the purposes of those sections the owner shall 
            not be deemed to be a displaced person as defined in 
            section 101 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 4601).
      (3) Development of basic outdoor recreation facilities.--Under 
    paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide financial assistance for a 
    project for development of basic outdoor recreation facilities to 
    serve the general public, including the development of Federal land 
    under lease to States for terms of 25 years or more. No assistance 
    shall be available under this chapter to enclose or shelter a 
    facility normally used for an outdoor recreation activity, but the 
    Secretary may permit local funding, not to exceed 10 percent of the 
    total amount allocated to a State in any one year, to be used for 
    construction of a sheltered facility for a swimming pool or ice 
    skating rink in an area where the Secretary determines that the 
    construction is justified by the severity of climatic conditions 
    and the increased public use made possible by the construction.
  (f) Payments.--
      (1) Criteria for making payments.--The Secretary may make a 
    payment to a State only for a planning, acquisition, or development 
    project that is approved by the Secretary. The Secretary shall not 
    make a payment for or on account of any project with respect to 
    which financial assistance has been given or promised under any 
    other Federal program or activity, and no financial assistance 
    shall be given under any other Federal program or activity for or 
    on account of any project with respect to which the assistance has 
    been given or promised under this chapter. The Secretary may make 
    payments from time to time in keeping with the rate of progress 
    toward the satisfactory completion of a project. The approval of 
    all projects and all payments, or any commitments relating thereto, 
    shall be withheld until the Secretary receives appropriate written 
    assurance from the State that the State has the ability and 
    intention to finance its share of the cost of all of the projects, 
    and to operate and maintain by acceptable standards, at State 
    expense, the properties or facilities acquired or developed for 
    public outdoor recreation use.
      (2) Payment recipients.--Payments for all projects shall be made 
    by the Secretary to the chief executive official of the State or to 
    a State official or agency designated by the chief executive 
    official or by State law having authority and responsibility to 
    accept and to administer funds paid under this section for approved 
    projects. If consistent with an approved project, funds may be 
    transferred by the State to a political subdivision or other 
    appropriate public agency.
      (3) Conversion to other than public outdoor recreation use.--No 
    property acquired or developed with assistance under this section 
    shall, without the approval of the Secretary, be converted to other 
    than public outdoor recreation use. The Secretary shall approve a 
    conversion only if the Secretary finds it to be in accordance with 
    the then-existing comprehensive statewide outdoor recreation plan 
    and only on such conditions as the Secretary considers necessary to 
    ensure the substitution of other recreation properties of at least 
    equal fair market value and of reasonably equivalent usefulness and 
    location. Wetland areas and interests therein as identified in the 
    wetlands provisions of the comprehensive plan and proposed to be 
    acquired as suitable replacement property within the same State 
    that is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary, acting through the 
    Director, shall be deemed to be of reasonably equivalent usefulness 
    with the property proposed for conversion.
      (4) Reports and accounting procedures.--No payment shall be made 
    to any State until the State has agreed to--
          (A) provide such reports to the Secretary in such form and 
        containing such information as may be reasonably necessary to 
        enable the Secretary to perform the Secretary's duties under 
        this chapter; and
          (B) provide such fiscal control and fund accounting 
        procedures as may be necessary to ensure proper disbursement 
        and accounting for Federal funds paid to the State under this 
        chapter.
  (g) Records.--A recipient of assistance under this chapter shall keep 
such records as the Secretary shall prescribe, including records that 
fully disclose--
      (1) the amount and the disposition by the recipient of the 
    proceeds of the assistance;
      (2) the total cost of the project or undertaking in connection 
    with which the assistance is given or used; and
      (3) the amount and nature of that portion of the cost of the 
    project or undertaking supplied by other sources, and such other 
    records as will facilitate an effective audit.
  (h) Access to Records.--The Secretary, and the Comptroller General, 
or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access for 
the purpose of audit and examination to any records of the recipient 
that are pertinent to assistance received under this chapter.
  (i) Prohibition of Discrimination.--With respect to property acquired 
or developed with assistance from the Fund, discrimination on the basis 
of residence, including preferential reservation or membership systems, 
is prohibited except to the extent that reasonable differences in 
admission and other fees may be maintained on the basis of residence.
  (j) Coordination With Federal Agencies.--To ensure consistency in 
policies and actions under this chapter with other related Federal 
programs and activities and to ensure coordination of the planning, 
acquisition, and development assistance to States under this section 
with other related Federal programs and activities--
      (1) the President may issue such regulations with respect thereto 
    as the President considers desirable; and
      (2) the assistance may be provided only in accordance with the 
    regulations.
  (k) Capital Improvement and Other Projects To Reduce Crime.--
      (1) Availability and purpose of funds.--In addition to assistance 
    for planning projects, and in addition to the projects identified 
    in subsection (e), and from amounts appropriated out of the Violent 
    Crime Reduction Trust Fund, the Secretary may provide financial 
    assistance to the States, not to exceed $15,000,000, for projects 
    or combinations thereof for the purpose of making capital 
    improvements and other measures to increase safety in urban parks 
    and recreation areas, including funds to--
          (A) increase lighting within or adjacent to public parks and 
        recreation areas;
          (B) provide emergency telephone lines to contact law 
        enforcement or security personnel in areas within or adjacent 
        to public parks and recreation areas;
          (C) increase security personnel within or adjacent to public 
        parks and recreation areas; and
          (D) fund any other project intended to increase the security 
        and safety of public parks and recreation areas.
      (2) Eligibility.--In addition to the requirements for project 
    approval imposed by this section, eligibility for assistance under 
    this subsection shall depend on a showing of need. In providing 
    funds under this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to 
    projects proposed for urban parks and recreation areas with the 
    highest rates of crime and, in particular, to urban parks and 
    recreation areas with the highest rates of sexual assault.
      (3) Federal share.--Notwithstanding subsection (c), the Secretary 
    may provide 70 percent improvement grants for projects undertaken 
    by a State for the purposes described in this subsection.

recreation recovery action programs that maximize coordination of all 
community resources, including other federally supported urban 
development and recreation programs. During an initial interim period 
to be established by regulations under this chapter, this requirement 
may be satisfied by local government submissions of preliminary action 
programs that briefly define objectives, priorities, and implementation 
strategies for overall system recovery and maintenance and commit the 
applicant to a scheduled program development process. Following this 
interim period, all local applicants shall submit to the Secretary, as

    adequately maintained, protected, staffed, and supervised;
      (4) the intention to maintain total local public outlays for park 
    and recreation purposes at levels at least equal to those in the 
    year preceding that in which grant assistance is sought except in 
    any case where a reduction in park and recreation outlays is 
    proportionate to a reduction in overall spending by the applicant; 
    and
      (5) the relationship of the park and recreation recovery program 
    to overall community development and urban revitalization efforts.
  (b) Continuing Planning Process.--Where appropriate, the Secretary 
may encourage local governments to meet action program requirements 
through a continuing planning process that includes periodic 
improvements and updates in action program submissions to eliminate 
identified gaps in program information and policy development.
  (c) Special Considerations.--Action programs shall address, but are 
not limited to--

        projects to maximize recreational opportunities through 
        conversion of abandoned railroad and highway rights of way, 
        waterfront, and other redevelopment efforts and such other 
        federally assisted projects as may be appropriate;
          (E) conversion of recreation use of street space, derelict 
        land, and other public land not now designated for neighborhood 
        recreational use; and
          (F) use of various forms of compensated and uncompensated 
        land regulation, tax inducements, or other means to encourage 
        the private sector to provide neighborhood park and recreation 
        facilities and programs.
  (d) Publication in Federal Register.--The Secretary shall establish

State of up to 15 percent of total project costs. The Federal matching 
amount shall not exceed 85 percent of total project cost.
  (b) Adequate Implementation of Local Recovery Plans.--The Secretary 
shall encourage States to assist the Secretary in ensuring--
      (1) that local recovery plans and programs are adequately 
    implemented by cooperating with the Secretary in monitoring local 
    park and recreation recovery plans and programs; and
      (2) consistency of the plans and programs, where appropriate, 
    with State recreation policies as set forth in statewide 
    comprehensive outdoor recreation plans.

Sec. 200506. Non-Federal share of project costs

  (a) Sources.--
      (1) Allowable sources.--The non-Federal share of project costs 
    assisted under this chapter may be derived from general or special 
    purpose State or local revenues, State categorical grants, special 
    appropriations by State legislatures, donations of land, buildings,

    planning services. Reasonable local costs of recovery action 
    program development to meet the requirements of section 200504(a) 
    of this title may be used as part of the local match only when the 
    local government has not received a recovery action program grant.
      (2) Non-allowable sources.--No amount from the Land and Water 
    Conservation Fund or from any other Federal grant program other 
    than the community development block grant programs shall be used 
    to match Federal grants under this program.

on such conditions as the Secretary considers necessary to ensure the 
provision of adequate recreation properties and opportunities of 
reasonably equivalent location and usefulness.

Sec. 200508. Coordination of program

  The Secretary shall--
      (1) coordinate the urban park and recreation recovery program 
    with the total urban recovery effort and cooperate to the fullest 
    extent possible with other Federal agencies and with State agencies 
    that administer programs and policies affecting urban areas,
