``Sec. 923A. Serial numbers for homemade firearms
    ``(a) Request.--A person who has attained 18 years of age and 
desires to make a firearm, or obtain a unique serial number or other 
identifying mark for a firearm made by the person after 1968, may 
request a licensed dealer to issue a unique serial number or other 
identifying mark for the firearm, which request shall describe the 
firearm involved, and state whether the firearm will be (or is) a 
handgun.
    ``(b) Consideration.--
            ``(1) Treatment of request as transfer proposal.--A request 
        made of a licensed dealer pursuant to subsection (a) with 
        respect to a firearm shall be treated as a proposed transfer of 
        the firearm from the licensed dealer to the applicant, for 
        purposes of section 922(t) of this title and section 103 of the 
        Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.
            ``(2) Issuance of serial number.--A licensed dealer may 
        issue to an applicant a unique serial number and identifying 
        mark for a firearm pursuant to such a request if, applying 
        paragraph (1) of this subsection to the request, section 922(t) 
        or other law would not prohibit the licensed dealer from 
        transferring the firearm to the applicant.
            ``(3) Fee authority.--A licensed dealer may charge an 
        applicant a fee for each serial number and identifying mark 
        assigned and issued under this section, in an amount that is

        issuing the serial number and identifying mark, and a fee for 
        contacting the national instant criminal background check 
        system with respect to the applicant.
