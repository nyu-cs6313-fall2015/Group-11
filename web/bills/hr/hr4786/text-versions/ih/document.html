        approval bill as described in subsection (c) not later than the 
        third day of session of that House after the date of receipt of 
        a special message transmitted to the Congress under Section 3.
            (2) Consideration in the house of representatives.--
                    (A) Referral and reporting.--Any committee of the 
                House of Representatives to which an approval bill is 
                referred shall report it to the House without amendment 
                not later than the third legislative day after the date 
                of its introduction. If a committee fails to report the 
                bill within that period or the House has adopted a 
                concurrent resolution providing for adjournment sine 
                die at the end of a Congress, such committee shall be 
                automatically discharged from further consideration of 
                the bill and it shall be placed on the appropriate 
                calendar.
                    (B) Proceeding to consideration.--Not later than 3 
                legislative days after the approval bill is reported or 
                a committee has been discharged from further 
                consideration thereof, it shall be in order to move to 
                proceed to consider the approval bill in the House. 
                Such a motion shall be in order only at a time 
                designated by the Speaker in the legislative schedule 
                within two legislative days after the day on which the 
                proponent announces an intention to the House to offer 
                the motion provided that such notice may not be given 
                until the approval bill is reported or a committee has 
                been discharged from further consideration thereof. 
                Such a motion shall not be in order after the House has 
                disposed of a motion to proceed with respect to that 
                special message. The previous question shall be 
                considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption 
                without intervening motion. A motion to reconsider the 
                vote by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in 
                order.
                    (C) Consideration.--If the motion to proceed is 
                agreed to, the House shall immediately proceed to 
                consider the approval bill in the House without 
                intervening motion. The approval bill shall be 
                considered as read. All points of order against the 
                approval bill and against its consideration are waived. 
                The previous question shall be considered as ordered on 
                the approval bill to its passage without intervening 
                motion except 4 hours of debate equally divided and 
                controlled by the proponent and an opponent and one 
                motion to limit debate on the bill. A motion to 
                reconsider the vote on passage of the approval bill 
                shall not be in order.
            (3) Consideration in the senate.--
                    (A) Committee action.--The appropriate committee of 
                the Senate shall report without amendment the approval 
                bill not later than the third session day after 
                introduction. If a committee fails to report the 
                approval bill within that period or the Senate has 
                adopted a concurrent resolution providing for 
                adjournment sine die at the end of a Congress, the 
                Committee shall be automatically discharged from 
                further consideration of the approval bill and it shall 
                be placed on the appropriate calendar.
                    (B) Motion to proceed.--Not later than 3 session 
                days after the approval bill is reported in the Senate 
                or the committee has been discharged thereof, it shall 
                be in order for any Senator to move to proceed to 
                consider the approval bill in the Senate. The motion 
                shall be decided without debate and the motion to 
                reconsider shall be deemed to have been laid on the 
                table. Such a motion shall not be in order after the 
                Senate has disposed of a prior motion to proceed with 
                respect to the approval bill.
                    (C) Consideration.--If a motion to proceed to the 
                consideration of the approval bill is agreed to, the 
                Senate shall immediately proceed to consideration of 
                the approval bill without intervening motion, order, or 
                other business, and the approval bill shall remain the 
                unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of. 
                Consideration on the bill in the Senate under this 
                subsection, and all debatable motions and appeals in 
                connection therewith, shall not exceed 10 hours equally 
                divided in the usual form. All points of order against 
                the approval bill or its consideration are waived. 
                Consideration in the Senate on any debatable motion or 
                appeal in connection with the approval bill shall be 
                limited to not more than 1 hour. A motion to postpone, 
                or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
                business, or a motion to recommit the approval bill is 
                not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which 
                the approval bill is agreed to or disagreed to is not 
                in order.
            (4) Amendments prohibited.--No amendment to, or motion to 
        strike a provision from, an approval bill considered under this 
        section shall be in order in either the Senate or the House of 
        Representatives.
            (5) Coordination with action by other house.--
                    (A) In general.--If, before passing the approval 
                bill, one House receives from the other a bill--
                            (i) the approval bill of the other House 
                        shall not be referred to a committee; and
                            (ii) the procedure in the receiving House 
                        shall be the same as if no approval bill had 
                        been received from the other House until the 
                        vote on passage, when the bill received from 
                        the other House shall supplant the approval 
                        bill of the receiving House.
                    (B) Exception.--This paragraph shall not apply to 
                the House of Representatives.
    (b) Limitation.--Subsection (a) shall apply only to an approval 
bill described in subsection (c) and introduced pursuant to subsection 
(a)(1).
    (c) Approval Bill Described.--For purposes of subsection (a), a 
bill described in this paragraph is a bill--
            (1) which consists of the proposed legislation which is 
        included in such report to carry out the recommendations made 
        by the Commission in the report; and
            (2) the title of which is as follows: ``A bill to carry out 
        the recommendations of the Commission on Long Term Social 
        Security Solvency.''.
    (d) Extended Time Period.--If Congress adjourns at the end of a 
Congress and an approval bill was then pending in either House of 
Congress or a committee thereof, or an approval bill had not yet been 
introduced with respect to a special message, then within the first 3 
days of session of the next Congress, the Commission shall transmit to 
Congress an additional special message containing all of the 
information in the previous, pending special message. An approval bill 
may be introduced within the first five days of session of such next 
Congress and shall be treated as an approval bill under this section, 
and the time periods described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection 
(a) shall commence on the day of introduction of that approval bill.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
