  <summary>1/16/2014--Introduced.
Immigrant Detainee Legal Rights Act - Directs the Attorney General to: (1) establish and maintain, within the Executive Office for Immigration Review, an Office of Legal Access Programs to develop and administer a system of legal orientation programs to make immigration proceedings more efficient and cost-effective by educating aliens regarding administrative procedures and legal rights under U.S. immigration law and to establish other programs to assist in providing aliens access to legal information; and (2) submit to Congress within 180 days a plan that includes a schedule to develop and deploy legal orientation programs for all detainees within 1 year after enactment of this Act.

Requires the legal orientation programs to: (1) provide programs to assist detained aliens in making decisions regarding their removal and eligibility for relief from removal in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs in immigration proceedings and federal custody processes and to improve access to legal services; (2) ensure that programs and written notice of rights are available in English and the five most common native languages spoken by the detainees held in custody at that location during the preceding fiscal year; and (3) identify unaccompanied alien children, aliens with a serious mental disability, and other particularly vulnerable aliens for right to counsel considerations.

Authorizes such programs to provide services to detained aliens in specified immigration (detention and removal) and asylum proceedings.

Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish procedures: (1) that ensure that legal orientation programs are available for all detained aliens within five days of arrival into custody; and (2) to inform such aliens of the basic procedures of immigration hearings, their rights relating to those hearings, information that may deter such aliens from filing frivolous legal claims, and a contact list of potential legal resources and providers.</summary>
