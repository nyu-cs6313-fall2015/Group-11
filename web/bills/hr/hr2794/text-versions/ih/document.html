                                 A BILL


 
To provide for the issuance of a forever stamp to honor the sacrifices 
of the brave men and women of the Armed Forces who are still prisoner, 
          missing, or unaccounted for, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Perpetual POW/MIA Stamp Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the Department of Defense reports that more than 83,000 
        servicemembers remain missing since World War II;
            (2) the United States Government has an obligation to 
        achieve the fullest possible accounting for the Americans who 
        have gone missing while serving the country and to leave no one 
        unaccounted for in future conflicts;
            (3) in 1982, the POW/MIA flag became the first flag other 
        than the Flag of the United States to fly over the White House 
        in Washington, DC;
            (4) on August 10, 1990, Public Law 101-355 designated the 
        POW/MIA flag as ``The Symbol of our Nation's concern and 
        commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of 
        Americans still prisoner, missing, and unaccounted for in 
        Southeast Asia.''; and
            (5) the POW/MIA flag should maintain continued visibility 
        as a constant reminder of the plight of America's Prisoners of 
        War and Missing in Action.

SEC. 3. PERPETUAL POW/MIA STAMP.

    (a) In General.--In order to continue to honor the sacrifices of 
the brave men and women of the Armed Forces who have been prisoner, 
missing, or unaccounted for, the Postmaster General shall provide for 
the issuance of a forever stamp suitable for that purpose and depicts 
the National League of Families POW/MIA flag.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this Act, the term ``forever 
stamp'' means a definitive stamp which meets the postage required for 
first-class mail up to one ounce in weight, and which retains full 
validity for that purpose even if the rate of that postage is later 
increased.
    (c) Effective Date.--The stamp described in subsection (a) shall be 
issued beginning as soon as practicable after the date of the enactment 
of this Act and shall not thereafter be discontinued.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
