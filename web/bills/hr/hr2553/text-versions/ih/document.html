                                 A BILL


 
  To facilitate efficient investments and financing of infrastructure 
 projects and new job creation through the establishment of a National 
        Infrastructure Development Bank, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Infrastructure Development 
Bank Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Investment in infrastructure has always created jobs 
        and economic growth for the United States and has been a key 
        component of maintaining a global competitive edge for the 
        United States.
            (2) The Erie Canal, the transcontinental railroad, the 
        Hoover Dam, rural electrification, and the interstate highway 
        system are all examples of investments in infrastructure that 
        created the conditions for future economic growth.
            (3) According to the World Economic Forum Global 
        Competitiveness Report, the United States ranks 14th overall in 
        infrastructure.
            (4) According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, 
        the current condition of the infrastructure in the United 
        States earns a grade point average of D+, and an estimated 
        $3,600,000,000,000 investment is needed by 2020 to meet 
        adequate conditions.
            (5) According to the National Surface Transportation Policy 
        and Revenue Study Commission, $225,000,000,000 is needed 
        annually from all sources for the next 50 years to upgrade our 
        surface transportation system to a state of good repair and 
        create a more advanced system.
            (6) The Environmental Protection Agency projects that--
                    (A) $334,800,000,000 is needed to invest in 
                infrastructure improvements over 20 years to ensure the 
                provision of safe water; and
                    (B) $202,500,000,000 is needed for publicly owned 
                wastewater systems-related infrastructure needs over 20 
                years.
            (7) According to the Edison Electric Institute, the 
        electric power industry will need to invest $298,000,000,000 in 
        the Nation's transmission system in the next 20 years in order 
        to maintain reliable service.
            (8) According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
        and Development (OECD), the United States ranks 15th among OECD 
        nations in fixed and wireless broadband access per 100 
        inhabitants.
            (9) Although grant programs of the Government must continue 
        to play a central role in financing the transportation, 
        environment, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure 
        needs of the United States, current and foreseeable demands on 
        existing Federal, State, and local funding for infrastructure 
        expansion exceed the resources to support these programs by 
        margins wide enough to prompt serious concerns about the United 
        States' ability to sustain long-term economic development, 
        productivity, and international competitiveness.
            (10) The capital markets, including central banks, pension 
        funds, financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and 
        insurance companies, have a growing interest in infrastructure 
        investment. The establishment of a United States Government-
        owned institution that would provide this investment 
        opportunity to finance qualifying infrastructure projects would 
        attract needed capital for United States infrastructure 
        development.
