Ensuring Access to Primary Care for Women and Children Act - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to require that the primary care services furnished in 2015 and 2016 by a physician with a primary specialty designation of family medicine, general internal medicine, or pediatric medicine be paid at a rate that is not less than 100% of the payment rate that applies to such services and physician under Medicare part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance).

Extends this 100% of Medicare payment floor under certain conditions to the following providers, who are self-attested as Board-certified and at least 60% of whose services billed for under Medicaid must be for primary care services: (1) physicians with a primary specialty designation of obstetrics and gynecology; (2) advanced practice clinicians; (3) rural health clinics, federally-qualified health centers, or other specified health clinics; and (4) nurse practitioners, physician assistants, or certified nurse-midwives.
