                                 A BILL


 
  To provide for temporary emergency impact aid for local educational 
                               agencies.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Public School Emergency Relief 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2014, the United States experienced an unprecedented 
        influx in arrivals of unaccompanied alien children.
            (2) Between January 1, 2014, and July 31, 2014, the 
        Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee 
        Resettlement released 37,477 unaccompanied alien children to 
        sponsors nationwide.
            (3) Federal law, as upheld by the Supreme Court decision 
        Plyer v. Doe, permits all children residing in the United 
        States access to a public elementary and secondary education 
        regardless of their immigration status.
            (4) An unprecedented influx of unaccompanied alien children 
        has resulted in a strain on the Nation's public school system.
            (5) In response to these conditions, this Act creates an 
        emergency grant for the 2014-2015 school year tailored to the 
        needs of local educational agencies affected by enrollment 
        increases attributable to unaccompanied alien children.

                received by a State educational agency for the 2014-

                            (i) the increase (if any) in the number of 
                        immigrant students--
                                    (I) as determined by the eligible 
                                local educational agencies and eligible

                                subsection (b)(2); over
                                    (II) the number of such students 
                                enrolled during the corresponding 
                                quarter of the 2012-2013 school year; 
                                and
                            (ii) $12,000.
                    (B) Insufficient funds.--If the amount available 
                under this section to provide emergency impact aid 
                under this subsection is insufficient to pay the full 
                amount that a State educational agency is eligible to 
                receive under this section, the Secretary of Education 
                shall ratably reduce the amount of such emergency 
                impact aid.
                    (C) Retention of state share.--In the case of a 
                State educational agency that has made a payment prior 
                to the date of enactment of this Act to a local 
                educational agency for the purpose of covering 
                additional costs incurred as a result of enrolling an 
                immigrant student in a school served by the local 
                educational agency, the State educational agency may 
                retain a portion of the payment described in paragraph 
                (2)(A)(ii) that bears the same relation to the total 
                amount of the payment under such paragraph as the sum 
                of such prior payments bears to the total cost of 
                attendance for all students in that local educational 
                agency for whom the State educational agency made such 
                prior payments.

        bia-funded schools.--

                        determined by the Secretary of Education. Such 
                        quarterly installment payments shall be based 
                        on the number of immigrant students reported 
                        under subsection (b)(2).
                            (ii) Payment amount.--Subject to paragraph 
                        (1)(B), each quarterly installment payment 
                        under clause (i) shall equal 25 percent of the 
                        amount determined under paragraph (1)(A).
                            (iii) Timeline.--The Secretary of Education

                        reporting on the number of immigrant students 
                        in order to make the appropriate disbursements 
                        in a timely manner.

                        quarter, the amount available under this 
                        section to make payments under this subsection 
                        is insufficient to pay the full amount that an 
                        eligible local educational agency or eligible 
                        BIA-funded school is eligible to receive under 
                        this section, the State educational agency
