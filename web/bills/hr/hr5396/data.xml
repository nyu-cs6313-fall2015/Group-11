  <summary>8/1/2014--Introduced.
Keeping Families Home Act of 2014 - Directs each mortgage servicer to establish a deed-for-lease program which shall permit an eligible mortgagor to:

 enter into a deed in lieu of foreclosure agreement; continue to occupy and lease the property that is the subject of the agreement for one year; and have a right of first refusal to purchase such property after the end of the one-year lease period, if the owner intends to sell the property at that time. Exempts small servicers from such requirement.

Requires a lease to carry a monthly rent amount equal to the fair market rent for the property, as determined by an independent private appraiser hired by and paid by the servicer.</summary>
