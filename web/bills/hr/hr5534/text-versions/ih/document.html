            ``(3) Priority.--In providing assistance under this 
        subsection, the Administrator shall give priority to assistance 
        that will promote compliance with national primary drinking 
        water standards, public health protection, and long-term 
        sustainability of small public water systems. In awarding 
        grants and cooperative assistance under paragraph (1) to 
        nonprofit organizations, the Administrator shall (subject to 
        the preceding sentence) give greater weight to nonprofit 
        organizations that, as determined by the Administrator, are 
        most qualified and most effective and that, as determined by 
        the Administrator using information where available, are 
        providing the types of technical assistance that are preferred 
        by small public water systems.
            ``(4) Competitive procedures.--It is the presumption of 
        Congress that any award of assistance under this subsection 
        will be awarded using competitive procedures based on merit. If 
        assistance is awarded under this subsection using procedures 
        other than competitive procedures, the Administrator shall 
        submit to the Congress, within 90 days of the award decision, a 
        report explaining why competitive procedures were not used.

                entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality, or 
                congressional district, other than through a statutory 
                or administrative formula-driven or competitive award 
                process.
                    ``(C) Lobbying expenses.--No portion of any State 
                loan fund established under section 1452 and no portion 
                of any funds made available under this subsection may 
                be used for lobbying expenses.

                required to meet the standard are affordable for
