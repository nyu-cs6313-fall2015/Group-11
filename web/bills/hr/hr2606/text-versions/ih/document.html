        and any waters within the jurisdiction of the United States.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Responsibilities for overseas stability and 
        reconstruction operations are divided among several Federal 
        agencies. As a result, lines of responsibility and 
        accountability are not well-defined.
            (2) Despite the establishment of the Office of the 
        Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization within the 
        Department of State, the reaffirmation of the Coordinator's 
        mandate by the National Security Presidential Directive 44, its 
        codification in title XVI of the Duncan Hunter National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), 
        the issuance of the Department of Defense Directive 3000.05, 
        and the creation of the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization by 
        the Department of State, serious imbalances and insufficient 
        interagency coordination remain.
            (3) The United States has not effectively or efficiently 
        managed stabilization and reconstruction operations during 
        recent decades.
            (4) Based on recent history, the United States will likely 
        continue to find its involvement necessary in stabilization and 
        reconstruction operations in foreign countries in the wake of 
        violence.
            (5) The United States has not adequately applied the 
        lessons of its recent experiences in stabilization and 
        reconstruction operations, and despite efforts to improve its 
        performance is not yet organized institutionally to respond 
        appropriately to the need to perform stabilization and 
        reconstruction operations in foreign countries.
            (6) The failure to implement the lessons learned of past 
        stabilization and reconstruction operations will lead to 
        further inefficiencies, resulting in greater human and 
        financial costs.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) protect the national security interests of the United 
        States by providing an effective means to plan for and execute 
        stabilization and reconstruction operations in foreign 
        countries;
            (2) provide for unity of command, and thus achieve unity of 
        effort, in the planning and execution of stabilization and 
        reconstruction operations;
            (3) provide accountability for resources dedicated to 
        stabilization and reconstruction operations;
            (4) maximize the efficient use of resources, which would 
        lead to budget savings, eliminated redundancy in functions, and 
        improvement in the management of stabilization and 
        reconstruction operations; and
            (5) establish an entity to plan for stabilization and 
        reconstruction operations across relevant Federal departments 
        and agencies, including the Department of Defense, the 
        Department of State, and the United States Agency for 
        International Development, and, when directed by the President, 
        coordinate and execute such operations, eventually returning 
        responsibility for such operations to other Federal departments 
        and agencies of the United States Government as the situation 
        at issue becomes normalized.

        such stabilization and reconstruction operation and the Armed 
        Forces.

        environment for the Armed Forces or other friendly forces.
