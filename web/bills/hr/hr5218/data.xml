Everson Walls and Ron Springs Gift for Life Act of 2014 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration to establish a National Organ and Tissue Donor Registry Resource Center.

Requires the Center to: (1) advance the development, expansion, and evaluation of state organ donor registries; (2) facilitate timely exchange of donor information between state registries; and (3) maintain a clearinghouse for information on registry best practices.

Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to states in order to develop, expand, or maintain state organ donor registries and establish benchmarks for improvement in organ donation. Requires a state registry that receives a grant to be accessible to individual donors and the Center.

Eliminates civil liability for a person taking an individual's organs as long as the person verified the individual's consent with a state organ donor registry.

Requires the Comptroller General (GAO) to study the feasibility of establishing a database to track the health effects of living organ donation.</summary>
