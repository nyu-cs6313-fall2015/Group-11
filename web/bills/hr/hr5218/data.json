Requires a state registry that receives a grant to be accessible to individual donors and the Center.\n\nEliminates civil liability for a person taking an individual's organs as long as the person verified the individual's consent with a state organ donor registry.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General (GAO) to study the feasibility of establishing a database to track the health effects of living organ donation."
