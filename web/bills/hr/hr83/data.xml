Division O: Multiemployer Pension Reform - Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 - Title I: Modifications to Multiemployer Plan Rules - Subtitle A: Amendments to Pension Protection Act of 2006 - (Sec. 101) Amends the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to repeal the December 31, 2014, sunset of, and make permanent, the PPA multiemployer funding rules.

(Sec. 102) Amends ERISA and the IRC to authorize the sponsor of a multiemployer plan that is not in critical status for a plan year, but that is projected by the plan actuary to be in critical status in any of the succeeding five plan years, to elect to be in critical status effective for the current plan year.

Prescribes annual certification and notice requirements.

(Sec. 103) Revises requirements for the emergence of a plan from critical status to add a requirement that the plan actuary certify that the plan is not projected to become insolvent for any of the 30 succeeding plan years. Requires an emerged plan to reenter critical status only if it meets either of the current or the new criterion for critical status.

(Sec. 104) Declares that a plan shall cease to be in endangered status for a plan year if:

 the plan actuary certifies that it is projected to no longer to qualify for such status at the end of the 10th plan year after it entered that status, and the plan was not in critical or endangered status for the immediately preceding plan year. (Sec. 105) Revises the formula for determining an increase in a plan's funding percentage, which is one of the two goals of a funding improvement plan that must be adopted for multiemployer plans in endangered status.

(Sec. 106) Revises rules for operation of a plan in endangered status during the period of adoption of a funding improvement plan.

(Sec. 107) Revises requirements for the imposition of a schedule for multiemployer plans in endangered or critical status where, after a collective bargaining agreement expires, the bargaining parties fail to adopt a contribution schedule under a funding improvement plan (endangered status) or a rehabilitation plan (critical status).

(Sec. 108) Repeals rules for the reorganization of multiemployer plans, including related minimum contribution requirements, the overburden credit against minimum contribution requirements, and requirements for adjustments in accrued benefits.

Treats remaining references to plans in reorganization as plans in critical status.

(Sec. 109) Revises requirements for rehabilitation plans that must be adopted for multiemployer plans in critical status.

Revises in particular the requirements, when determining an employer's withdrawal liability, for the disregard of:

 benefit reductions in determining a plan's unfunded vested benefits, and surcharges in determining the allocation of such unfunded vested benefits. Requires the disregard of surcharges, as well, in determining the highest contribution rate.

Requires disregard also, in determining the allocation of unfunded vested benefits to an employer, and in determining the highest contribution rate, of any increase in the contribution rate (or any other increase in contribution requirements unless due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided) that is required or made in order to enable the multiemployer plan to meet the requirements of the funding improvement plan or rehabilitation plan.

Declares that, in the case of such disregarded increases in the contribution rate (or other increases in contribution requirements unless due to increased levels of work, employment, or periods for which compensation is provided), these requirements shall cease to apply once a collective bargaining agreement expires which was in effect when the multiemployer plan emerged from endangered or critical status.

(Sec. 110) Declares that a qualified preretirement survivor annuity payable to the surviving spouse of a participant under a multiemployer plan which becomes insolvent or is terminated shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the participant has not died as of the date on which the plan became insolvent or was terminated. (Thus guarantees, in the absence of other disqualifying factors, the payment by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC] of a qualified preretirement survivor annuity to a participant of a multiemployer pension plan which becomes insolvent or is terminated.)

Makes this prohibition retroactive to multiemployer plan benefit payments payable on or after January 1, 1985, except where the surviving spouse has died before enactment of this Act.

(Sec. 111) Expands the sorts of information the administrator of a multiemployer define benefit plan must furnish, upon request, to any plan participant or beneficiary, employee representative, or employer obliged to contribute to the plan. Adds to the list, among other things, copies of the current plan document, the latest summary plan description, the current trust agreement, an employer's participation agreement, audited plan financial statements, and the latest funding improvement or rehabilitation plan and related contribution schedules for any plan in critical or endangered status.

Authorizes any employee representative, or any employer obliged to contribute to a plan, to bring a civil action to: (1) enjoin any act or practice which violates these disclosure requirements, or (2) obtain appropriate equitable relief to redress a violation or enforce the requirements.

Subtitle B: Multiemployer Plan Mergers and Partitions - (Sec. 121) Authorizes the PBGC, upon sponsor request, to take appropriate action to promote and facilitate the merger of two or more multiemployer plans if it determines that the transaction is in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of at least one of the plans and is not reasonably expected to be adverse to the overall interests of the participants and beneficiaries of any of the plans.

Permits such facilitation to include training, technical assistance, mediation, communication with stakeholders, and support with related requests to other government agencies.

 Authorizes the PBGC to enable one or more of the plans involved in a merger to avoid or postpone insolvency by providing financial assistance to a merged plan, but only if:

 one or more of the multiemployer plans participating in the merger is in critical and declining status; the PBGC reasonably expects that the financial assistance will reduce its expected long-term loss with respect to the plans involved, and is necessary for the merged plan to become or remain solvent; and the financial assistance is paid exclusively from the fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans. (Sec. 122) Revises requirements for the partition of a plan.

Makes a multiemployer plan eligible for partition only if:

 the plan is in critical and declining status; the PBGC determines, after consultation with the selected Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate, that the plan sponsor has taken (or is taking concurrently with an application for partition) all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency, including certain maximum benefit suspensions, if applicable; the PBGC reasonably expects that a partition will reduce it's expected long-term loss with respect to the plan, and is necessary for the plan to remain solvent; the PBGC certifies to Congress that its ability to meet existing financial assistance obligations to other plans (including any liabilities associated with multiemployer plans that are insolvent or that are projected to become insolvent within 10 years) will not be impaired by the partition; and the cost to the PBGC arising from the partition is paid exclusively from the fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans. Requires a partition order to provide for a transfer to a successor plan of the minimum amount of the partitioned plan's liabilities necessary for the plan to remain solvent.

Prescribes requirements for:

 the withdrawal liability of any employer that withdraws from the partitioned plan within 10 years after the partition order, and payment of the monthly benefit to each participant or beneficiary of the partitioned plan whose benefit was transferred to the successor plan. Requires any successor plan that provides a benefit improvement effective after the partition's effective date to pay the PBGC a specified amount related to the increase in benefit payments for each year during the 10-year period following partition.

Requires the partitioned plan to pay the premiums imposed by the PBGC with respect to participants whose benefits were transferred to the successor plan for each year during that 10-year period.

Subtitle C: Strengthening the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation - (Sec. 131) Increases the annual premium rate payable to the PBGC by a multiemployer plan for basic benefits guaranteed to $26 for each individual participant in the plan during each plan year beginning after December 31, 2014. Prescribes a formula for this rate for each plan year beginning in a calendar year after 2015.

Requires that specified amounts of premiums received with respect to the fund used for basic multiemployer plan guaranteed benefits be placed in a noninterest-bearing account within the fund. Requires that any PBGC financial assistance to prevent a plan from becoming insolvent be withdrawn proportionately from the noninterest-bearing and other accounts within the fund.

Title II: Remediation Measures for Deeply Troubled Plans - (Sec. 201) Revises conditions, limitations, distribution and notice requirements, and the approval process for benefit suspensions under multiemployer plans in critical and declining status.

Allows a plan sponsor, by plan amendment, to suspend benefits temporarily or permanently, in accordance with certain requirements, if a plan is in declining as well as critical status, if it is projected to become insolvent during the current plan year or any of the 14 succeeding plan years (19 succeeding plan years if the plan has a ratio of inactive participants to active participants that exceeds 2 to 1, or if the funded percentage of the plan is less than 80%).

Requires any suspension of benefits to remain in effect until the earlier of when the plan sponsor provides benefit improvements or the suspension expires by its own terms. Declares that the plan shall not be liable for any benefit payments not made as a result of a suspension of benefits.

Requires the sponsor of a plan with 10,000 or more participants, not later than 60 days before applying to suspend benefits, to select a plan participant in pay status to act as a retiree representative to advocate for the interests of the retired and deferred vested participants and plan beneficiaries throughout the suspension approval process.

Prescribes as conditions for suspending benefits that:

 the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to avoid insolvency, assuming the suspensions of benefits continue until they expire by their own terms or, if no such expiration date is set, indefinitely; and the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan is still projected to become insolvent unless benefits are suspended, although all reasonable measures to avoid insolvency have been taken (and continue to be taken during the period of the benefit suspension). Specifies limitations on any suspension of benefits, including that:

 the monthly benefit of any participant or beneficiary may not be reduced below 110% of the monthly benefit guaranteed by the PBGC on the date of the suspension; not more of the benefits of a participant or beneficiary age 75 years as of the suspension date may be suspended than a certain applicable percentage of the maximum suspendable benefits that would otherwise be suspended, computed according to a specified formula; no benefits based on disability may be suspended; any suspensions of benefits, in the aggregate, shall be reasonably estimated to achieve, but not materially exceed, the level necessary to avoid insolvency; any benefit suspensions shall be equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population, taking specified factors into account; and the benefits suspended shall be applied according to three specified priorities. Allows a plan sponsor, in its sole discretion, to provide benefit improvements while any suspension of benefits remains in effect.

Prohibits the sponsor, however, from increasing plan liabilities by reason of any benefit improvement for any participant or beneficiary not in pay status by the first day of the plan year for which the benefit improvement takes effect, unless certain conditions are met, including an equitable distribution of such improvements.

Prescribes requirements for: (1) notice to participants and beneficiaries, (2) the process for approval of a suspension application by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation with the PBGC and the Secretary of Labor, and (3) a participant ratification voting process.

Permits a suspension of benefits to be implemented, notwithstanding rejection of suspension by a participant ratification vote, if the plan is systemically important (i.e., the present value of its PBGC-projected financial assistance payments exceeds $1 billion if suspensions are not implemented).

Subjects to judicial review any plan sponsor action to challenge denial of an application for suspension of benefits.

Division P: Other Retirement-Related Modifications - (Sec. 1) Amends ERISA with respect to the treatment as a substantial employer subject to specified liability of any employer that ceases operations at a facility in any location with the result that more than 20% percent of the total number of the employees participating under the employer's single-employer pension plan are separated from employment.

(The substantial employer liability referred to as specified under current law is the liability of a substantial employer for withdrawal from, or termination of, single-employer plans under multiple controlled groups.)

Revises the meaning of a substantial cessation of operations.

Eliminates the requirement that more than 20% of the total number of the employer's employees who participate under its single-employer plan be separated from employment.

Exempts from the general rule any single employer plan if, for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the substantial cessation of operations occurred: (1) there were fewer than 100 participants with accrued benefits under the plan as of its valuation date, or (2) the ratio of the market value of the assets of the plan to the plan's funding target for the plan year was 90% or greater.

Redefines "substantial cessation of operations" as a permanent cessation of operations at a facility which results in a workforce reduction of a number of eligible employees at the facility equivalent to more than 15% of the number of all the employer's eligible employees, determined immediately before the earlier of: (1) the date of the employer's decision to implement the cessation; or (2) the earliest date on which any such eligible employee was separated from employment in the case of a workforce reduction including one or more eligible employees whose separation, during the three years before the cessation, is nonetheless related to permanent cessation of operations at the facility.

Precludes from taking into account in computing a workforce reduction any separated employee replaced, within a reasonable period of time, at the same or another facility located in the United States, by a U.S. citizen or resident.

Prescribes criteria for disregarding in the computation of a workforce reduction either an eligible employee separated from employment with the transferor employer at a facility or an eligible employee who continues to be employed at the facility by the transferee employer.

Prescribes requirements for treatment of eligible separated employees when a portion of operations, otherwise substantially ceased, are subsequently conducted by another (transferee) employer by reason of a sale or other disposition of the assets or stock of a contributing sponsor (or any member of the same controlled group as the sponsor) of the plan.

Permits an employer to satisfy its liability with respect to a plan by reason of the treatment accorded under this Act in the event of a substantial cessation of operations at a facility by making contributions to the plan, in addition to any minimum required contribution, and in amount determined according to a specified formula, for each plan year in the seven-plan-year period beginning when the cessation occurred.

 Waives an employer's obligation to make such additional contributions, however, with respect to: (1) the first plan year (after the cessation occurs) for which the ratio of the market value of the plan assets to the plan's funding target for the plan year is 90% or greater, or (2) any plan year following such a year. Makes such a waiver permanent if the Secretary of the Treasury issues the funding waiver for a plan year within the seven-plan-year period beginning when the cessation occurred.

Prescribes requirements for enforcement of any additional plan contributions elected.

 Declares that, for purposes of this Act, an employer shall not be treated as ceasing operations at a qualified lodging facility (hotel, motel, or any other establishment more than half of whose dwelling units are used on a transient basis) if those operations are continued by an eligible independent contractor pursuant to an agreement with the employer.

(Sec. 2) Formulates a special rule for determining normal retirement age for certain existing defined benefit plans.

Exempts from the established normal retirement age requirement any defined benefit plan whose terms, on or before December 8, 2014, provided for a normal retirement age which is the earlier of:

 an age otherwise permitted by the established normal retirement age requirement, or the age at which a participant completes the number of years (at least 30 years) of benefit accrual service specified by the plan. States that a plan shall not fail to be treated as an applicable plan solely because this alternative normal retirement age only applied to certain participants or only applied to employees of certain employers in the case of a multiemployer plan. Allows such a plan to expand the application of its alternative normal retirement age to additional participants or to employees of additional employers maintaining the plan, as long as they: (1) became participants on or before January 1, 2017; or (2) were employees before this date of any employer maintaining the plan, and who become plan participants after January 1, 2017.

(Sec. 3) Amends both ERISA and the IRC to apply the rules for cooperative and small employer charity pension plans to a defined benefit employee pension plan (other than a multiemployer plan) maintained, as of June 25, 2010, by a tax-exempt charitable organization:

 with employees in at least 40 states, and whose primary exempt purpose is to provide services with respect to children. Division Q: Budgetary Effects - (Sec. 1) Exempts the budgetary effects of division 0 (Multiemployer Pension Reform) and division P (Other Retirement- Related Modifications) from provisions of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 and the FY2008 Senate Budget Resolution requiring offsets for legislation increasing the budget deficit. Provides that the budget effects of the two divisions shall not be estimated for the purposes of enforcing discretionary spending limits or specified provisions of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.</summary>
