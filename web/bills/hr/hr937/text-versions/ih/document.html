  To support innovation and research in the United States textile and 
                        fiber products industry.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Textile Technology 
Innovation and Research for Exportation (ATTIRE) Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States textile industry continues to thrive 
        and evolve despite changing economic and labor conditions;
            (2) the United States textile industry employs over 500,000 
        workers nationwide and contributes nearly $60,000,000,000 to 
        the gross domestic product annually;
            (3) the United States textile industry is a primary 
        supplier of domestic jobs to women and minorities, with many of 
        these jobs located in economically depressed rural and urban 
        areas;
            (4) research and innovation are essential to the United 
        States textile industry's ability to maintain its competitive 
        advantage and expand its export on an international scale; and
            (5) by working closely with the textile industry to improve 
        existing technologies and to identify new market opportunities, 
        university-based textile research programs and not-for-profit 
        textile research centers play a critical role in promoting 
        innovation and growth in the textile industry and in the United 
        States economy as a whole.

              THROUGH UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY-BASED RESEARCH.

        including shifts to technologically advanced textile 
        production.
            (3) To discover, design, and develop new materials, and

        and create transfer mechanisms to ensure the utilization of 
        technologies developed.

        in a fiscal year may be disbursed to institutions of higher 
        education.
            (2) Waiver authority.--If the Secretary of Commerce 
        determines that the limitation of paragraph (1) would result in 
        the failure to disburse all appropriated funds for a fiscal 
        year, the Secretary may waive such limitation for such fiscal 
        year.
