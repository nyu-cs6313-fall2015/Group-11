                                 A BILL


 
  To encourage and ensure the use of safe equestrian helmets, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Christen O'Donnell Equestrian Helmet 
Safety Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Head injuries are the number one reason for hospital 
        admissions of horseback riders and the leading cause of death 
        following a horseback riding injury.
            (2) Over 100 deaths per year are estimated to result from 
        equestrian related activities, with head injuries accounting 
        for 3 of every 5 of these deaths.
            (3) Nearly 68,000 people visited the emergency room in 2012 
        as a result of horseback riding related injuries, with head 
        injuries accounting for 22 percent and concussions accounting 
        for 7 percent of these visits.
            (4) Horseback riding causes 11.7 percent of sports-related 
        traumatic brain injuries, which is the largest percentage of 
        any recreational sport.
            (5) Between 2001 and 2009, children under 19 made 3,638 
        emergency room visits per year for traumatic brain injuries 
        resulting from horseback riding accidents.
            (6) Between 75 and 80 percent of head injuries occur while 
        physically mounted on a horse--when a rider would normally be 
        wearing his or her helmet.
            (7) Racing organizations require helmets, and as a result 
        jockeys now sustain fewer head injuries than pleasure riders.
            (8) The U.S. Pony Clubs lowered head injury rates by 29 
        percent through mandatory helmet use.
            (9) Properly fitted ASTM/SEI certified helmets can reduce 
        head injury-related deaths by 70 to 80 percent.

SEC. 3. STANDARDS.

    (a) In General.--Every equestrian helmet manufactured on or after 
the date that is 9 months after the date of enactment of this Act shall

        pending the establishment of a final standard pursuant to

                    (B) provide in the final standard a mandate that

        standard takes effect, an equestrian helmet that does not meet

        standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act.
            (2) Status of final standard.--The final standard developed
