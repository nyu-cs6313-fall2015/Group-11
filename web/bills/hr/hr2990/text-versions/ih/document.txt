        marks, labels, and notices that the Secretary by regulation 
        prescribes.
            ``(2) Marking requirements for domestic market.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Each person who is a 
                manufacturer or importer of tobacco products or 
                processed tobacco shall (in accordance with regulations 
                prescribed by the Secretary) ensure that, before any 
                product intended for sale or distribution within the 
                United States is removed, a unique identification 
                marking is affixed to or forms part of each package of 
                tobacco product or processed tobacco manufactured or 
                imported by such person for sale or distribution.
                    ``(B) Markings on individual packages.--Any 
                markings required to be placed on a tobacco product or 
                processed tobacco package by this subsection shall be 
                placed on the innermost sealed container visible from 
                the outside of the individual package. For any tobacco 
                product or processed tobacco package that contains 
                multiple smaller packages of tobacco products or 
                processed tobacco, any markings required to be so 
                placed on tobacco product or processed tobacco packages 
                shall be placed on all the individual tobacco product 
                or processed tobacco packages.
                    ``(C) Markings on aggregate packing modes.--To 
                facilitate efficient tracking and tracing of tobacco 
                products or processed tobacco through the distribution 
                system, all manufacturers or importers of tobacco 
                products or processed tobacco shall, in addition to 
                such unique identification marking, also, in accordance 
                with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, ensure 
                that unique identification markings are affixed to or 
                form part of aggregate packing modes (such as cartons, 
                cases, and master cases for cigarettes). The Secretary 
                shall determine the size, location, and methods for 
                such markings. The Secretary shall establish 
                regulations requiring that all persons within the 
                distribution chain, up to but not including the 
                ultimate retailer, utilize the unique identification 
                markings on aggregate packing modes to facilitate the 
                tracking and tracing of tobacco products or processed 
                tobacco through the distribution system.
            ``(3) Marking requirements for exports.--A unique 
        identification marking shall be affixed to or form part of each 
        package of tobacco product or processed tobacco that is 
        exported, or sold for export, that distinguishes it from those 
        products or processed tobacco intended for sale or distribution 
        within the United States. The Secretary shall by regulation 
        prescribe the size, location, and other characteristics of such 
        marking, and it may contain a serial number that is assigned to 
        the country of export, except that no such serial number shall 
        be required on tobacco products or processed tobacco sold at 
        retail to consumers by duty free stores for consumption beyond 
        the jurisdiction of the internal revenue laws of the United 
        States. Such tobacco products or processed tobacco shall 
        instead bear markings indicating the tobacco product or 
        processed tobacco is only for duty-free sale to consumers, as 
        prescribed through regulation by the Secretary, before the 
        product or processed tobacco is removed.
            ``(4) Authorization of federal unique identification 
        marking.--Not later than 3 years after the date of the 
        enactment of the Smuggled Tobacco Prevention Act of 2013, the 
        Secretary shall by regulation require the use of a unique 
        identification marking on all products subject to tax under 
        this chapter.''.
    (b) Unique Identification Marking.--Section 5723 is amended by 
adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(f) Unique Identification Marking.--
            ``(1) In general.--No tobacco product or processed tobacco 
        may be sold, offered for sale, distributed, mailed, or 
        otherwise delivered for final sale to any consumer in the 
        United States unless the unique identification marking that 
        meets the requirements of this section (and any regulations 
        prescribed thereunder) is affixed to or forms part of the 
        package in which it is contained.
            ``(2) System specifications.--

                coordinate and avoid interference with State, local, 
                and Indian tribal tax stamps and markings, facilitate 
                collection of the tax imposed by this chapter, impede 
                contraband tobacco trafficking, minimize counterfeit 
                marking, allow for more effective tracking and tracing 
                of tobacco products and processed tobacco, facilitate 
                the enforcement of related Federal laws, and utilize 
                such available technology as may promote the purposes 
                of this chapter.
                    ``(B) The Secretary shall prescribe the method and 
                manner in which such unique identification markings are 
                to be distributed, purchased, and applied to or made 
                part of tobacco product and processed tobacco packages,
