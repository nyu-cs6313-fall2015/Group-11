  <summary>5/6/2014--Introduced.
Small Business Freedom to Grow Act of 2014 - Directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise Form S-1 so that a smaller reporting company may incorporate by reference in a registration statement filed on that form any documents it files with the SEC after the registration statement's effective date.

Directs the SEC to revise Form S-3 so as to permit securities to be registered pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1. of the form if either: (1) the aggregate market value of voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates of the registrant is $75 million or more, or (2) the registrant has at least one class of common equity securities listed and registered on a national securities exchange.

Requires the SEC to remove a certain listing and registration requirement from General Instruction I.B.6. of Form S-3.</summary>
