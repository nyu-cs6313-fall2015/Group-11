    (b) Delay Permitted if State Legislation Required.--
            (1) In general.--Until the date described in paragraph (2), 
        a qualified State plan shall not be regarded as failing to

        State legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) 
        in order for the plan to meet the additional requirements 
        imposed by reason of this Act.
                                 <all>
