                the principal residence of the taxpayer.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ending Taxpayer Subsidies for Yachts 
Act''.

SEC. 2. MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION ALLOWED WITH RESPECT TO BOATS ONLY 
              IF BOAT IS USED AS THE PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE OF THE 
              TAXPAYER.

    (a) In General.--Subclause (ii) of section 163(h)(4)(A) of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting ``(other than a 
boat)'' after ``1 other residence of the taxpayer''.
    (b) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--The amendment made by this section shall 
        apply to indebtedness incurred after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act.
            (2) Special rule for refinancings.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, indebtedness resulting from the refinancing of 
        indebtedness shall be treated as incurred on the date the 
        refinanced indebtedness was incurred (taking into account the 
        application of this paragraph in the case of multiple 
        refinancings) but only to the extent the indebtedness resulting 
        from such refinancing does not exceed the refinanced 
        indebtedness.
