SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Risk of death among individuals with anorexia nervosa 
        is 18 times greater than their same age peers without anorexia.
            (2) Health consequences such as osteoporosis (brittle 
        bones), gastrointestinal complications, and dental problems are 
        significant health and financial burdens throughout life.
            (3) An estimated 14 million people suffer from earing 
        disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and 
        eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) (including 
        binge eating disorder). The lifetime prevalence of all eating 
        disorders in America is 0.6 to 4.5 percent.
            (4) Eating disorders are real, treatable medical illnesses. 
        They frequently coexist with other illnesses such as 
        depression, substance abuse, or anxiety disorders. Eating 
        disorders can become life-threatening if a person does not 
        receive treatment.
            (5) Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by 
        self-starvation and excessive weight loss. An estimated 0.9 
        percent of American women and 0.3 percent of American men will 
        suffer from anorexia nervosa in their lifetime.
            (6) Anorexia nervosa is associated with serious health 
        consequences including heart failure, kidney failure, 
        osteoporosis, and death.
            (7) Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by 
        excessive food consumption followed by inappropriate 
        compensatory behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse 
        of laxatives, fasting, or excessive exercise. An estimated 1.5 
        percent of American women and 0.5 percent of American men will 
        suffer from this disorder in their lifetime.
            (8) Bulimia nervosa is associated with cardiac, 
        gastrointestinal, and dental problems including irregular 
        heartbeats, gastric rupture, peptic ulcer, tooth decay, and 
        death.
            (9) Binge eating disorder is characterized by frequent 
        episodes of uncontrolled overeating. Binge eating disorder is 
        common: an estimated 3.5 percent of American women and 2.0 
        percent of American men will suffer from this disorder in their 
        lifetime.
            (10) Binge eating is associated with obesity, heart 
        disease, gall bladder disease, and diabetes.
            (11) Many more suffer from some, but not all, of the 
        symptoms of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating 
        disorder, which is referred to as eating disorders not 
        otherwise specified (EDNOS). Between 4 percent and 20 percent 
        of young women practice unhealthy patterns of dieting, purging, 
        and binge eating.
            (12) Eating disorders are more common in women, but they do 
        occur in men. Rates of binge eating disorder are similar in 
        females and males.
            (13) Eating disorders usually appear in adolescence and are 
        associated with substantial psychological problems, including 
        depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Eating disorders also 
        develop in younger children and adults, compromising health and 
        daily functioning. For children 12 years of age and younger, 
        hospitalizations for eating disorders increased by 119 percent 
        between 1999 and 2006.
            (14) Eating disorders are found across races, ethnicities, 
        and socioeconomic groups in the United States. White females 
        are more likely to suffer from anorexia, while African-American 
        girls are especially vulnerable to developing eating disorders 
        that involve binge eating. Body dissatisfaction in young girls 
        has been shown in White, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian 
        girls.

SEC. 4. DEFINITION.

    In this Act, the term ``eating disorder'' includes anorexia 
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and eating disorders 
not otherwise specified (EDNOS), as defined in the fifth edition of 
``Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' or, if 
applicable, the most recent successor edition.
