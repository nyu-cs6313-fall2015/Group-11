  <summary>3/27/2014--Introduced.
American Manufacturing and Worker Protection Act of 2014 - Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 to direct the Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to distribute semiannually all funds (including any interest earned) from duties assessed pursuant to a countervailing duty order or antidumping duty order or finding (antidumping and subsidy protection amount) to affected domestic producers for qualifying expenditures and cash to eligible employees.

Defines "affected domestic producer" to mean a currently operating manufacturer or producer that was a petitioner or interested party in support of a petition for which an antidumping duty order, finding, or countervailing duty order has been entered.

Defines "eligible employee" of an affected domestic producer as an individual who: (1) has been totally or partially separated from employment with that producer because of dumping or a subsidy for which an antidumping duty order, finding, or countervailing duty order has been entered; or (2) is an employee of the affected domestic producer at the time a distribution is made.

Defines "qualifying expenditures" to mean certain expenditures incurred by an affected domestic producer after the issuance of an antidumping duty order, finding, or countervailing duty order.

Requires the CBP Commissioner to establish in the Treasury a special account for each such order or finding and to deposit in those accounts all funds (including any interest earned) from antidumping or countervailing duties assessed on or after October 1, 2014.

Declares that the requirements of this Act shall apply with respect to goods from Canada and Mexico.</summary>
