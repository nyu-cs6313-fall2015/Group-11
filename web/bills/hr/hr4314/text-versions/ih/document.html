SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF VETERAN STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--Chapter 36 of title 38, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 3699. Student loan repayment program for totally disabled 
              veterans
    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a student loan 
repayment program in which the Secretary repays the undergraduate 
student loans of covered veterans.
    ``(b) Monthly Payment.--In carrying out subsection (a), the 
Secretary, on a monthly basis, shall pay directly to the holder of an

the Secretary may pay for a covered veteran enrolled in the program

the holder of any undergraduate student loan of the veteran as of the 
date on which the veteran became totally service-connected disabled.
    ``(3) In addition to the total amount paid pursuant to paragraph 
(2), with respect to a covered veteran enrolled in the program 
established under subsection (a) who, as of the date on which the 
veteran applies for such enrollment, owes to the holder of an 
undergraduate student loan of the veteran an amount that is less than 
the total amount that the veteran owed as of the date on which the 
veteran became totally service-connected disabled, the Secretary shall 
pay to the covered veteran an amount equal to--
            ``(A) the difference of--

                of the date of such disability; and
                    ``(ii) the amount the veteran owes to such holder 
                as of the date of such application; plus
            ``(B) any interest to the amount calculated under 
        subparagraph (A), as determined by the Secretary based on the 
        percentage by which there was a social security increase (as 
        defined in section 1104(b) of this title) during each year 
        occurring during the period beginning on the date of such 
        disability and ending on the date of such application.
