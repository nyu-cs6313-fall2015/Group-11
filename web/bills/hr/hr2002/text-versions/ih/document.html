        of the record of the court-martial.'';
            (2) in paragraph (3), by striking the second sentence; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
    ``(4) If a convening authority or other person acts on the findings 
of a court-martial, the convening authority or other person may not, 
except for a charge or specification for a minor offense--
            ``(A) dismiss any charge or specification by setting aside 
        a finding of guilty thereto; or
            ``(B) change a finding of guilty to a charge or 
        specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a 
        lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or 
        specification.
    ``(5) For purposes of this section (article), whether an offense is 
minor depends on the nature of the offense, the circumstances 
surrounding its commission, and the maximum sentence imposable for the 
offense if tried by general court-martial. Ordinarily, a minor offense 
is an offense for which the maximum sentence imposable would not 
include dismissal or a dishonorable discharge or confinement for longer 
than one year. The decision whether an offense is minor is a matter of 
discretion of the convening authority, except that no offense of a 
sexual nature may be considered minor.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply with 
respect to findings and sentences of courts-martial reported to 
convening authorities under section 860 of title 10, United States Code 
(article 60 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), as so amended, on 
or after that date.
