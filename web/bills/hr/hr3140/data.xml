  <summary>9/19/2013--Introduced.
Ensure Reliable and Affordable American Energy Act of 2013 - Amends the Clean Air Act to prohibit a regulation concerning emissions of carbon dioxide from a fossil fuel-fired electric generating unit to address climate change from taking effect until the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certifies that a sufficient number of countries have put into effect regulations concerning such emissions that are at least as stringent as the regulation under the Act.

Defines "sufficient number" to mean a number of countries that, in the aggregate, account for at least 80% of global carbon dioxide emissions, excluding those in the United States, in the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the regulation under the Act would be enforced.</summary>
