  <summary>5/22/2014--Introduced.
Certify It Act of 2014 - Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to study the impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) on small businesses and the Office of the Actuary, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, to study the Act's impact on small group health insurance costs.

Declares that, if GAO or the Office of the Actuary reports to Congress that PPACA has caused either net employment loss amongst small businesses or small group health insurance costs to rise, certain PPACA assessments that may be imposed on employers for failing to offer their full-time employees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage shall not apply for a specified one-year period.

Declares further that, if GAO or the Office fails to submit such a report in accordance with specified timelines, such assessments shall not apply during the following calendar year.</summary>
