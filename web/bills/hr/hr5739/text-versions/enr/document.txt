                                 An Act


 
   To amend the Social Security Act to provide for the termination of 
   social security benefits for individuals who participated in Nazi 
                  persecution, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``No Social Security for Nazis Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds the following:
        (1) Congress enacted social security legislation to provide 
    earned benefits for workers and their families, should they retire, 
    become disabled, or die.
        (2) Congress never intended for participants in Nazi 
    persecution to be allowed to enter the United States or to reap the 
    benefits of United States residency or citizenship, including 
    participation in the Nation's Social Security program.
SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF BENEFITS.
    (a) In General.--Section 202(n)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 402(n)(3)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(3) For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection--
        ``(A) an individual against whom a final order of removal has 
    been issued under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration and 
    Nationality Act on grounds of participation in Nazi persecution 
    shall be considered to have been removed under such section as of 
    the date on which such order became final;
        ``(B) an individual with respect to whom an order admitting the 
    individual to citizenship has been revoked and set aside under 
    section 340 of the Immigration and Nationality Act in any case in 
    which the revocation and setting aside is based on conduct 
    described in section 212(a)(3)(E)(i) of such Act (relating to 
    participation in Nazi persecution), concealment of a material fact 
    about such conduct, or willful misrepresentation about such conduct 
    shall be considered to have been removed as described in paragraph 
    (1) as of the date of such revocation and setting aside; and
        ``(C) an individual who pursuant to a settlement agreement with 
    the Attorney General has admitted to conduct described in section 
    212(a)(3)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to 
    participation in Nazi persecution) and who pursuant to such 
    settlement agreement has lost status as a national of the United 
    States by a renunciation under section 349(a)(5) of the Immigration 
    and Nationality Act shall be considered to have been removed as 
    described in paragraph (1) as of the date of such renunciation.''.
    (b) Other Benefits.--Section 202(n) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 402(n)) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(4) In the case of any individual described in paragraph (3) 
whose monthly benefits are terminated under paragraph (1)--
        ``(A) no benefits otherwise available under section 202 based 
    on the wages and self-employment income of any other individual 
    shall be paid to such individual for any month after such 
    termination; and
        ``(B) no supplemental security income benefits under title XVI 
    shall be paid to such individual for any such month, including 
    supplementary payments pursuant to an agreement for Federal 
    administration under section 1616(a) and payments pursuant to an 
    agreement entered into under section 212(b) of Public Law 93-66''.
