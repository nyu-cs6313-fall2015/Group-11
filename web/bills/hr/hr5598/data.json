Prohibits the Secretary from implementing such an action until the Secretary: (1) complies with such consultation requirement, and (2) obtains the concurrence of each affected county.\n\nDefines an \"access travel management action\" as a BLM action that will alter public access to public lands, including any change in access to mining claims or access using motorized vehicles or nonmotorized means resulting from the decommissioning of a road or trail, a change in the status of a road as open or closed, or a change in road densities."
