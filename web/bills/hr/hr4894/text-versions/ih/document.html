SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States Commission on an Open 
Society with Security Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) an open society which affords free access to public 
        facilities and spaces and which protects the right to engage in 
        open discussion is an essential premise of American 
        governmental institutions and democratic values;
            (2) the United States is currently facing a challenge to 
        the safety and security of the public, public employees, and 
        public facilities and spaces that is unique in the history of 
        this Nation;
            (3) to meet this challenge without eroding or harming any 
        of the basic tenets of the Republic and of our democracy, this 
        Nation needs to assemble the best thinking available; and
            (4) a commission of experts from a broad base of 
        disciplines and backgrounds is necessary to examine all the 
        factors that should be considered in securing public safety 
        from terrorist attacks while maintaining the highest level of 
        free and open access to the public.
