        term `political expenditure in support of or in opposition to 
        any candidate for Federal, State, or local public office' means 
        an expenditure or series of expenditures totaling more than 
        $10,000 for any single candidate during any single election

                Campaign Act of 1971 or is relating to a candidate for 
                State or local public office that would be treated as 
                an independent expenditure under such Act if the 
                candidate were a candidate for Federal public office;
                    ``(B) is an electioneering communication, as such 
                term is defined in section 304(f)(3) of such Act (2 
                U.S.C. 434(f)(3)); or

                in subparagraph (A) or (B).''.

the preceding 6-year period. Such disclosure must be clear and 
conspicuous and, at minimum, contain the name and political party 
affiliation of each candidate in support of whom or in opposition to 
whom a political expenditure was made, the amount of each such 
expenditure, the public office that such candidate was or is seeking, 
including the relevant State, city, or district, and a statement of the 
issuer's interest in and reason for making such expenditure. For 
purposes of this subsection, the term `political expenditure in support

1933 (15 U.S.C. 77g) is amended by adding at the end the following:
