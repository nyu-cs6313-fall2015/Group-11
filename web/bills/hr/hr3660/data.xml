  <summary>12/5/2013--Introduced.
Alerting Local Leaders and Ensuring Responsible Guidelines for Youth Act or the ALLERGY Act - Amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to condition each local educational agency's (LEA's) receipt of funds under the ESEA on the LEA establishing and implementing a policy on allergy bullying that requires its schools to:

 educate students, school personnel, and parents about allergy bullying and about such bullying being against school rules; clearly define what the punishment or response may be for violating the rule against allergy bullying, which may include a therapeutic response, where appropriate; encourage each victim of allergy bullying to report such bullying to school personnel; and remain in compliance with the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 in carrying out these requirements. Requires the LEAs to submit an annual written certification to their state that they have established and implemented such policy.

Defines "allergy bullying" as unwanted, aggressive behavior by a student toward another student with an allergy, including: (1) a real or perceived imbalance of power due to such other student's allergy; and (2) actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, making physical or verbal attacks, and excluding such other student from a group on purpose.</summary>
