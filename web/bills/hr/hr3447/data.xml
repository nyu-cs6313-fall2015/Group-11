Furloughed Federal Employee Double Dip Elimination Act - Requires regulations pertaining to the compensation of any federal employees who receive back pay for any period in which such employee was furloughed due to a lapse in appropriations to require such back pay to be treated&#160;in the same way as federal wages attributable to such employee, and the period to which such back pay relates to be treated in the same way as a period of federal service attributable to such employee (thereby disqualifying such employee for receipt of state unemployment compensation).</summary>
