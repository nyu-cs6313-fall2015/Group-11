SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States has a national interest in 
        maintaining the stability and security of the global commons in 
        the Asia-Pacific region.
            (2) In October 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
        laid out an enduring vision for continued United States 
        involvement in the Asia-Pacific region throughout the coming 
        century through strengthened security alliances, deeper 
        relations with emerging powers, broader engagement with 
        regional multilateral institutions, greater trade and 
        investment, a broad-based security posture, and the pursuit of 
        democracy and protection of human rights.
            (3) In November 2011, President Barack Obama stated before 
        the Australian Parliament that the United States will stand for 
        security as the foundation of peace and prosperity, the rights 
        and responsibilities of all nations and people, international 
        law enforcing agreements and norms, freedom of commerce and 
        navigation, integration of emerging powers into a regional 
        security architecture, and the peaceful resolution of disputes.
            (4) In January 2012, the Defense Strategic Guidance, 
        released by the Department of Defense, emphasized the 
        importance of the Asia-Pacific region, citing ``U.S. economic 
        and security interests are inextricably linked to developments 
        in the arc extending from the Western Pacific and East Asia 
        into the Indian Ocean region and South Asia,'' and accordingly, 
        ``we will of necessity rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific 
        region''.
            (5) In June 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta 
        reaffirmed at the Shangri-La Dialogue that the United States 
        remains committed to the principles of open and free commerce, 
        a just international order that emphasizes rights and 
        responsibilities of all nations and a fidelity to the rule of 
        law, open access by all to the shared domains of sea, air, 
        space, and cyberspace, and the resolution of disputes without 
        coercion or the use of force.
            (6) The United States relationships with its treaty allies 
        in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan, the Republic of 
        Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand, are at the 
        heart of United States policy and engagement in the region, and 
        these countries share a common approach to supporting peace and 
        stability, freedom of navigation, and other internationally 
        lawful uses of sea and airspace in the region.
            (7) The United States continues to work with these and 
        other regional countries on a range of transnational security 
        and humanitarian issues, including countering the proliferation 
        of weapons of mass destruction, encouraging the peaceful 
        resolution of territorial disputes, responding to and 
        mitigating humanitarian disasters, halting the illicit 
        trafficking of people, drugs, and weapons, coordinating to 
        monitor and combat the risk of pandemic disease, and fighting 
        the disruptive activities of state and non-state actors for the 
        betterment of regional stability and prosperity.
            (8) The United States military continues to work closely 
        with the armed forces of these and other regional countries to 
        maintain vigilance against threats to the global commons and 
        international order, deter against acts of aggression, and 
        field capabilities to mitigate risks to allied and partner 
        states in the Asia-Pacific region.
            (9) Security shifts in the Asia-Pacific region over the 
        past decade have prompted a reassessment of the forces and 
        capabilities necessary to provide domain awareness, credible 
        deterrence, and effective defense in future decades to uphold 
        the United States security commitments to the region and to 
        maintain regional stability.
            (10) As provided in written testimony to the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the House of Representatives in March 2014, 
        Admiral Samuel Locklear, Commander of U.S. Pacific Command, 
        noted that, ``North Korea remains our most dangerous and 
        enduring challenge . . . North Korea's pursuit of nuclear 
        weapons and ballistic missiles, in contravention of its 
        international obligations, constitutes a significant threat to 
        peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast 
        Asia.''.
            (11) As provided in written testimony to the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the House of Representatives in November 
        2013, Dr. Larry Wortzel, Commissioner, United States-China 
        Economic and Security Review Commission, noted that, ``China's 
        military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), is undergoing an 
        extensive modernization program that presents significant 
        challenges to U.S. security interests in Asia.''.
            (12) As Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, 
        Technology and Logistics, Mr. Frank Kendall, testified before 
        the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives 
        on January 28, 2014, ``Anti-access aerial denial capabilities 
        that concern us cover a range of conventional capabilities. In 
        the case of China in particular, for example, they include 
        space control investments, offense cyber capabilities, 
        conventional ballistic and cruise missiles with precision-
        seekers designed both fixed land installations and surface 
        ships, including aircraft carriers; air-to-air capabilities, 
        including fifth-generation fighters, long-range missiles with 
        advance technologies seekers, and electronic warfare 
        systems.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the security, stability, and prosperity of the Asia-
        Pacific region is vital to United States national interests;
            (2) security and stability, largely provided by United 
        States forces and their forward presence, underwrite United 
        States national interests in the Asia-Pacific region;
            (3) the United States remains unwavering in its commitment 
        and support for allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific region;
            (4) efforts by the Department of Defense to realign forces, 
        commit additional assets, and increase investments to the Asia-
        Pacific region are welcome signs of the United States continued 
        commitment to the region;
            (5) to counter anti-access and area-denial capabilities, 
        deter regional aggression, assure allies and partners, sustain 
        military balance in the Asia-Pacific region, and enable more 
        effective operations in contested and denied environments, the 
        Department of Defense will need to--
                    (A) develop new concepts and initiatives, such as 
                Air-Sea Battle (ASB) and the Strategic Capabilities 
                Office (SCO);
                    (B) invest in a new generation of military 
                capabilities, in areas such as undersea warfare, power-
                projection, munitions, amphibious capabilities, 
                resilient space architectures, and missile defenses; 
                and
                    (C) nurture technologies, in areas such as 
                electromagnetics, directed energy, hypersonics, and 
                electronic warfare; and
            (6) the development of regional institutions and bodies, 
        including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 
        Regional Forum, the ASEAN Defense Minister's Meeting, the East 
        Asia Summit, and the expanded ASEAN Maritime Forum, should be 
        supported to build practical cooperation in the Asia-Pacific 
        region and reinforce the role of international law.

        Services of the House of Representatives on March 5, 2014, that 
        in the spring of 2013, North Korea ``conducted another 
        underground nuclear test, threatened the use of a nuclear 
        weapon against the United States, and concurrently conducted a 
        mobile missile deployment of an Intermediate Range Ballistic 
        Missile, reportedly capable of ranging our western most U.S. 
        territory in the Pacific.'';
            (2) General Curtis Scaparrotti, Commander of the United 
        States Forces Korea, testified before such committee on April 
        2, 2014, that ``CFC [Combined Forces Command] is placing 
        special emphasis on missile defense, not only in terms of 
        systems and capabilities, but also with regard to implementing 
        an Alliance counter-missile strategy required for our combined 
        defense.''; and
            (3) increased emphasis and cooperation on missile defense 
        among the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, 
        enhances the security of allies of the United States in 
        Northeast Asia, increases the defense of forward-based forces 
        of the United States, and enhances the protection of the United 
        States.
    (b) Assessment Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct an

SEC. 106. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SPACE SECURITY AND DEFENSE PROGRAM.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the Sense of Congress that--
            (1) critical United States national security space systems 
        are facing a serious growing foreign threat;
            (2) the People's Republic of China and the Russian 
        Federation are both developing capabilities to disrupt the use 
        of space by the United States in a conflict, as recently 
        outlined by the Director of National Intelligence in testimony 
        before Congress; and
            (3) a fully developed multi-faceted space security and 
        defense program is needed to deter and defeat any adversaries' 
        acts of space aggression.
    (b) Report on Ability of the United States To Deter and Defeat 
Adversary Space Aggression.--Not later than 180 days after the date of

Response to Foreign Counterspace Capabilities.--
            (1) Study required.--The Secretary of Defense, acting 
        through the Office of Net Assessment, shall conduct a study of 
        potential alternative defense and deterrent strategies in 
        response to the existing and projected counterspace 
        capabilities of China and Russia. Such study shall include an 
        assessment of the congruence of such strategies with the 
        current United States defense strategy and defense programs of

SEC. 107. SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) As General William Shelton testified before the 
        Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives on 
        April 3, 2014, ``[Space Situational Awareness] underpins 
        everything we do in space''.
            (2) At the same hearing, Lieutenant General John Raymond, 
        Commander, Joint Functional Component Command for Space, 
        further testified that, ``Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is 
        fundamental to effective operation and defense of our 
        capabilities. SSA allows us to maintain the current and 
        predictive knowledge of the space domain and the operational 
        environment upon which space operations depend. We rely on SSA 
        to provide timely and accurate warning to alert national and 
        military leaders and our partners of impending threats and 
        hostile actions.''.
    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to the Secretary of Defense $10,000,000 for fiscal year 
2015 for research, development, test, and evaluation, Air Force, for 
enhancing the space situational awareness capabilities of the Air 
Force. Such authorization is in addition to any other authorization of 
appropriations for the Secretary for such fiscal year.

SEC. 108. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ACCESS TO TRAINING RANGES WITHIN UNITED 
              STATES PACIFIC COMMAND AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Reliable access to military training ranges is an 
        essential component of military readiness.
            (2) The training opportunities provided by military 
        training ranges are critical to maintaining the technical and 
        operational superiority of the Armed Forces.
            (3) The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review states that the 
        operational readiness of the Armed Forces hinges on unimpeded 
        access to land, air, and sea training and test space.
            (4) A number of critical military training ranges are 
        located within the United States Pacific Command area of 
        responsibility.
            (5) Due to the ``tyranny of distance'' in the Asia-Pacific 
        region, there are significant challenges in transporting 
        equipment and personnel to the various military training ranges 
        within the United States Pacific Command area of 
        responsibility.
            (6) The Department of Defense continues a number of efforts 
        aimed at preserving military training ranges, while also 
        minimizing the environmental effects of training activities.
            (7) The Department of Defense has a variety of authorities 
        that may be used to mitigate encroachment on military testing 
        and training missions.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings specified in 
subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of 
Defense should--
            (1) ensure that members of the Armed Forces continue to 
        have reliable access to military training ranges;
            (2) optimize the use of multilateral, joint training 
        facilities overseas in order to increase readiness and 
        interoperability with allies and partners of the United States;
            (3) utilize a full range of assets, including both air- and 
        sea-based assets, to improve accessibility to military training 
        areas within the United States Pacific Command area of 
        responsibility;
            (4) provide stable budget authority for long-term 
        investment in range and test center infrastructure, 
        prioritizing those within the United States Pacific Command 
        area of responsibility; and
            (5) take appropriate action to identify and mitigate 
        encroachment or other challenges that have the potential to 
        impact access or operations on military training ranges.

SEC. 109. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON POHAKULOA TRAINING AREA IN HAWAII.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Pohakuloa Training Area in Hawaii is a premier 
        military training area in the Pacific region, providing units 
        from all United States military services, as well as militaries 
        of allies and partners with realistic joint and combined arms 
        training opportunities not found elsewhere in the world.
            (2) The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review states that United 
        States forces in the Asia-Pacific region ``will resume regular 
        bilateral and multilateral training exercises, pursue increased 
        training opportunities to improve capabilities and capacity of 
        partner nations, as well as support humanitarian, disaster 
        relief, counterterrorism, and other operations that contribute 
        to the stability of the region.''.
            (3) There are significant challenges in transporting 
        equipment and personnel to the Pohakuloa Training Area from the 
        Island of Oahu, where all United States Pacific Command service 
        components are permanently based.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings specified in 
subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of 
Defense should--
            (1) maximize the use of the Pohakuloa Training Area in 
        Hawaii by all Armed Forces components, and increase its use for 
        bilateral and multilateral exercises with regional allies and 
        partners;
            (2) utilize a full range of assets to improve access to the 
        Training Center, including both air- and sea-based assets such 
        as inactive Joint High Speed Vessels;
            (3) invest in capabilities and modest improvements to lower 
        the cost of access to the Training Center, such as construction 
        of a C-17 capable runway; and
            (4) take appropriate action to leverage existing 
        authorities and programs, as well as work with the State of 
        Hawaii and municipalities to leverage their authorities, to 
        address any challenges that have the potential to impede future 
        access to or operations on military training ranges.

             TITLE II--MATTERS RELATING TO FOREIGN NATIONS

SEC. 201. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON MARITIME DISPUTES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC 
              REGION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States has a national interest in 
        maintaining freedom of navigation, freedom of the seas, respect 
        for international law, and unimpeded lawful commerce, including 
        in the East China and South China Seas.
            (2) There has been an unprecedented increase in aggressive 
        actions by the Government of the People's Republic of China in 
        the East China Sea, to include--
                    (A) dangerous activities by Chinese maritime 
                agencies in areas near the Senkaku islands, including 
                the intrusion of between 6 and 25 Chinese ships into 
                Japanese administered territory in the East China Sea 
                each month since September 2012, between 26 and 124 
                ships into the ``contiguous zone'' in the same time 
                period, and 9 ships into Japanese administered 
                territory and 33 ships into the contiguous zone in 
                February 2014; and
                    (B) a unilateral declaration on November 23, 2013, 
                without prior consultations with the United States, 
                Japan, the Republic of Korea, or other nations of the 
                Asia-Pacific region, of an Air Defense Identification 
                Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea.
            (3) In recent years, there have also been numerous 
        dangerous and destabilizing incidents in the South China Sea, 
        specifically in waters near the coasts of the Philippines, the 
        People's Republic of China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, where the 
        use of coercion, intimidation, and military force by claimants 
        seeking to change the status quo have raised tensions in the 
        region. Such unilateral actions include--
                    (A) continued restrictions on access to Scarborough 
                Reef and pressure on long-standing Philippine presence 
                at the Second Thomas Shoal by the People's Republic of 
                China;
                    (B) establishing hydrocarbon blocks up for bid in 
                areas that are under dispute;
                    (C) announcing administrative and military 
                districts in contested areas in the South China Sea; 
                and
                    (D) imposing new fishing regulations covering 
                disputed areas.
            (4) On December 5, 2013, the USS Cowpens was lawfully 
        operating in international waters in the South China Sea when a 
        People's Liberation Army Navy vessel crossed its bow at a 
        distance of less than 500 yards and stopped in the water, 
        forcing the USS Cowpens to take evasive action to avoid a 
        collision. Such action appears contrary to the international 
        legal obligations of the People's Republic of China under 
        International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 
        (COLREGs).
            (5) The increasing frequency and assertiveness of patrols 
        and competing regulations over disputed territory and maritime 
        areas and airspace in the South China Sea and the East China 
        Sea are raising tensions and increasing the risk of 
        miscalculation and confrontation.
            (6) The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has 
        promoted multilateral talks on disputed areas without settling 
        the issue of sovereignty, and in 2002 joined with the People's 
        Republic of China in signing a Declaration on the Conduct of 
        Parties in the South China Sea that committed all parties to 
        those territorial disputes to ``reaffirm their respect for and 
        commitment to the freedom of navigation in and over flight 
        above the South China Sea as provided for by the universally 
        recognized principles of international law'' and to ``resolve 
        their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful 
        means, without resorting to the threat or use of force''.
            (7) The United States Government has a clear interest in 
        the peaceful diplomatic resolution of disputed maritime claims 
        in accordance with international law and is firmly opposed to 
        coercion, intimidation, threats, or the use of force.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--The United States--
            (1) reaffirms its unwavering commitment and support for 
        allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific region, and for the 
        longstanding United States policy that Article V of the United 
        States-Japan Mutual Defense Treaty applies to the Japanese-
        administered Senkaku Islands;
            (2) opposes claims that impinge on the rights, freedoms, 
        and lawful use of the sea that belong to all nations and urges 
        all parties to refrain from engaging in destabilizing 
        activities, including illegal occupation or efforts to 
        unlawfully assert administration over disputed claims;
            (3) supports the development of regional institutions and 
        bodies, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
        (ASEAN) Regional Forum, the ASEAN Defense Minister's Meeting 
        Plus, the East Asia Summit, and the expanded ASEAN Maritime 
        Forum, to increase regional cooperation and ensure that 
        disputes are managed without intimidation, coercion, or force; 
        and
            (4) continues United States military operations in, and 
        transit through, international waters and airspace in the Asia-
        Pacific region, in accordance with established principles and 
        practices of international law.

SEC. 202. SENSE OF CONGRESS REAFFIRMING SECURITY COMMITMENT TO JAPAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States highly values its alliance with the 
        Government of Japan as a cornerstone of peace and security in 
        the region, based on shared values of democracy, the rule of 
        law, free and open markets, and respect for human rights in 
        order to promote peace, security, stability, and economic 
        prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region;
            (2) the United States welcomes Japan's determination to 
        contribute more proactively to regional and global peace and 
        security;
            (3) the United States supports recent increases in Japanese 
        defense funding, adoption of a National Security Strategy, 
        formation of security institutions such as the Japanese 
        National Security Council, re-examination of the legal basis 
        for its security including the matter of exercising its right 
        of collective self-defense and other moves that will enable 
        Japan to bear even greater alliance responsibilities;
            (4) the United States and Japan should continue to improve 
        joint interoperability and collaborate on developing future 
        capabilities with which to maintain regional stability in an 
        increasingly uncertain security environment;
            (5) the United States and Japan should continue efforts to 
        strengthen regional multilateral institutions that promote 
        economic and security cooperation based on internationally 
        accepted rules and norms;
            (6) the United States acknowledges that the Senkaku Islands 
        are under the administration of Japan and opposes any 
        unilateral actions that would seek to undermine such 
        administration, affirms that unilateral actions of a third 
        party will not affect the United States acknowledgment of the 
        administration of Japan over the Senkaku Islands, and remains 
        committed under the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security 
        to respond to any armed attack in the territories under the 
        administration of Japan; and
            (7) the United States reaffirms its commitment to the 
        Government of Japan under Article V of the Treaty of Mutual 
        Cooperation and Security that ``[e]ach Party recognizes that an 
        armed attack against either Party in the territories under the 
        administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and 
        safety and declares that it would act to meet the common danger 
        in accordance with its constitutional provisions and 
        processes''.

              THE UNITED STATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States and the Republic of Korea have forged 
        a strong security alliance over the last 60 years;
            (2) the alliance has been strengthened in joint missions to 
        fight the global war on terror and has been further bolstered 
        through a continuous trend of meaningful sales of United States 
        military hardware to Korea;
            (3) the relationship between the two countries was further 
        solidified in 2011 through the United States-Korea Free Trade 
        Agreement which has led to growth in trade of goods and 
        services; and
            (4) additional opportunities should be identified to ensure 
        that this relationship continues to grow in the long term and 
        more closely reflects United States relationships with other 
        free trade agreement partner countries.
    (b) Report Required.--Not later than October 1, 2014, the Secretary 
of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense committees, the 
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, a report on

                Taiwan.
            (2) A description and assessment of the posture and 
        readiness of elements of the armed forces of Taiwan expected or 
        available to maintain the maritime or territorial security of 
        Taiwan, including an assessment of--
                    (A) the undersea and surface warfare capabilities 
                of the navy of Taiwan;
                    (B) the land-based anti-ship cruise missile 
                capabilities of Taiwan; and
                    (C) other anti-access or area-denial capabilities, 
                such as mines, that contribute to the deterrence of 
                Taiwan against actions taken to determine the future of 
                Taiwan by other than peaceful means.
    (c) Form.--The report required by subsection (a) may be submitted 
in classified or unclassified form.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States, in accordance with the Taiwan 
        Relations Act (Public Law 96-8), should continue to make 
        available to Taiwan such defense articles and services as may 
        be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-
        defense capability;
            (2) the growth and modernization of the People's Liberation 
        Army, including its focus on ``preparing for potential conflict 
        in the Taiwan Strait [which] appears to remain the principal 
        focus and primary driver of China's military investment'', as 
        noted in the 2013 Office of the Secretary of Defense Annual 
        Report to Congress: Military and Security Developments 
        Involving the People's Republic of China, requires greater 
        attention to the needed defense capabilities of Taiwan; and
            (3) the United States should consider opportunities to help 
        enhance the maritime capabilities and nautical skills of the 
        Taiwanese navy that can contribute to Taiwan's self-defense and 
        to regional peace and stability, in areas such as humanitarian 
        assistance and disaster relief operations, including extending 
        an invitation to Taiwan to participate in the 2014 Rim of the 
        Pacific international maritime exercise.
