                                 A BILL


 
    To protect the eligibility for Federal employment and access to 
classified information for Department of Defense civilian employees who 
  may incur financial hardships as a result of furloughs dictated by 
                             sequestration.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Security Clearance Protection Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On March 1, 2013, pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 
        2011, across-the-board spending cuts went into effect, 
        triggering a massive cut in Federal discretionary spending 
        across each Federal department and agency until $1.2 trillion 
        in savings is achieved.
            (2) The impact of the cuts from sequestration will be 
        significant and will affect many civilian employees who work 
        for the Federal Government, some of whom handle classified 
        materials to protect national security.
            (3) To absorb such budget cuts, Federal department and 
        agencies will furlough many civilian employees for up to 22 
        days a year.
            (4) Some civilian employees will incur financial hardships 
        and may not be able to meet their financial obligations due to 
        loss of pay.
            (5) Sequestration and employee furloughs are a result of 
        circumstances outside of the control of Federal employees and 
        no fault of their own.

SEC. 3. NO EFFECT ON ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION DUE TO 
              SEQUESTRATION.

    The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that, if any financial 
hardship is incurred by a civilian employee of the Department of 
Defense due to a furlough as a result of sequestration under section 
251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, 
that financial hardship will not affect the employee's--
            (1) eligibility for continued suitability for employment by 
        the Department;
            (2) access to classified information; or
            (3) suitability to hold a position critical to national 
        security.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
