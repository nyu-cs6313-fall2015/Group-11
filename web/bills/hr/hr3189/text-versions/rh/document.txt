    This Act may be cited as the ``Water Rights Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF WATER RIGHTS.

    The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture--
            (1) shall not condition the issuance, renewal, amendment, 
        or extension of any permit, approval, license, lease, 
        allotment, easement, right-of-way, or other land use or 
        occupancy agreement on the transfer of any water right directly 
        to the United States, or any impairment of title, in whole or 
        in part, granted or otherwise recognized under State law, by 
        Federal or State adjudication, decree, or other judgment, or 
        pursuant to any interstate water compact; and
            (2) shall not require any water user to apply for or 
        acquire a water right in the name of the United States under 
        State law as a condition of the issuance, renewal, amendment, 
        or extension of any permit, approval, license, lease, 
        allotment, easement, right-of-way, or other land use or 
        occupancy agreement.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION.

    For purposes of this Act, the term ``water right'' means any 
surface, groundwater, or storage use filed, permitted, certificated, 
confirmed, decreed, adjudicated, or otherwise recognized by a judicial 
proceeding or by the State in which the user acquires possession of the 
water or puts it to beneficial use.

SEC. 4. IMPACT ON EXISTING AUTHORITY.

Secretaries to condition any permit, approval, license, lease, 
allotment, easement, right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy 
agreement on Federal lands subject to their respective jurisdictions.
            Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to prohibit the 
        conditioning of any permit, lease, or other use agreement on 
        the transfer of any water right to the United States by the 
        Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture.''.
