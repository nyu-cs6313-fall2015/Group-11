                                 A BILL


 
 To provide for the conveyance of unused Federal property administered 
  by the Department of the Navy at the site of the former Oxnard Air 
                Force Base, Ventura County, California.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. LAND CONVEYANCE, FORMER OXNARD AIR FORCE BASE, VENTURA 
              COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Conveyance Authorized.--At such time as the Department of the 
Navy vacates the parcel of real property known as DOD Camarillo 
Airport, which was originally deeded to the Department of Defense at no 
cost by Ventura County, California (in this section referred to as the 
``County''), is located at the site of former Oxnard Air Force Base and 
adjacent to County-operated Camarillo Airport, and is administered by 
Naval Base Ventura County, the Secretary of the Navy may convey, 
without consideration, to the County all right, title, and interest of 
the United States in and to the real property, including any 
improvements thereon, for the purpose of permitting the County to use 
the property for airport-related activities.
    (b) Payment of Costs of Conveyance.--
            (1) Payment required.--The Secretary of the Navy shall 
        require the County to cover costs (except costs for 
        environmental remediation of the property) to be incurred by 
        the Secretary, or to reimburse the Secretary for such costs 
        incurred by the Secretary, to carry out the conveyance under 
        subsection (a), including survey costs, costs for environmental 
        documentation, and any other administrative costs related to 
        the conveyance. If amounts are collected from the County in 
        advance of the Secretary incurring the actual costs, and the 
        amount collected exceeds the costs actually incurred by the 
        Secretary to carry out the conveyance, the Secretary shall 
        refund the excess amount to the County.
            (2) Treatment of amounts received.--Amounts received as 
        reimbursement under paragraph (1) shall be credited to the fund 
        or account that was used to cover those costs incurred by the 
        Secretary in carrying out the conveyance. Amounts so credited 
        shall be merged with amounts in such fund or account, and shall 
        be available for the same purposes, and subject to the same 
        conditions and limitations, as amounts in such fund or account.
    (c) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal 
description of the property to be conveyed under subsection (a) shall 
be determined by a survey satisfactory to the Secretary of the Navy.
    (d) Additional Terms.--The Secretary of the Navy may require such 
additional terms and conditions in connection with the conveyance as 
the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the interests of the 
United States.
                                 <all>
