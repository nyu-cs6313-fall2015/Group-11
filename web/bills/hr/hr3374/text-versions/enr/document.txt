                                 An Act


 
To provide for the use of savings promotion raffle products by financial 
       institutions to encourage savings, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``American Savings Promotion Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds that--
        (1) the annual savings rate in the United States was 4.1 
    percent in 2012;
        (2) more than 40 percent of American households lack the 
    savings to cover basic expenses for 3 months, if an unexpected 
    event leads to a loss of stable income;
        (3) personal savings provide Americans with the financial 
    resources to meet future needs, including higher education and 
    homeownership, while also providing a safety net to weather 
    unexpected financial shocks;
        (4) prize-linked savings products are typical savings products 
    offered by financial institutions, like savings accounts, 
    certificates of deposit, and savings bonds, with the added feature 
    of offering chances to win prizes based on deposit activity;
        (5) the State of Michigan was the first State to allow credit 
    unions to offer prize-linked savings products, and in 2009 launched 
    the first large-scale prize-linked savings product in the United 
    States;
        (6) the States of Connecticut, Michigan, Maine, Maryland, 
    Nebraska, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Washington all have 
    laws that allow financial institutions to offer prize-linked 
    savings products;
        (7) in the States of Michigan and Nebraska, more than 42,000 
    individuals have opened prize-linked savings accounts and saved 
    more than $72,000,000;
        (8) prize-linked savings products have been shown to 
    successfully attract non-savers, the asset poor, and low-to-
    moderate income groups, providing individuals with a new tool to 
    build personal savings; and
        (9) encouraging personal savings is in the national interest of 
    the United States.
