                    (B) if the Secretary determines that the sale of an 
                aircraft under subparagraph (A) is not appropriate,

                    (A) make the aircraft available for sale to another

                retire or dispose of the aircraft in a manner the 
                Secretary determines appropriate.

SEC. 3. REPORT ON MILITARY PRESENCE IN EUROPE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees (as defined in section 101(a)(16) of 
title 10, United States Code) a report analyzing the necessity of 
stationing members of the Armed Forces in Europe, including an 
evaluation of property owned by the Federal Government in Europe that 
could be sold if such stationing was reduced or terminated.
    (b) Matters Included.--The report under subsection (a) shall 
consider the following:
            (1) Benefits to the United States from having the Armed 
        Forces present in Europe that would not be achievable 
        elsewhere.
            (2) Direct military threats to the United States that 
        require such a presence and whether such threats could be 
        countered with a smaller presence.
            (3) The ability of European allies to address threats 
        without such presence.
            (4) Ways in which a withdrawal or reduction of members of 
        the Armed Forces stationed in Europe will affect the 
        sustainability of military operations abroad.
            (5) Ways in which such a withdrawal or reduction will 
        affect the ability of the United States to implement a broader 
        national security strategy.
            (6) Any formal treaty obligations or bilateral agreements 
        that require the Armed Forces of the United States to be 
        present in Europe.
            (7) Effectiveness of current force levels in Europe in 
        achieving national security objectives.
            (8) Unique benefits of sustaining each base location in 
        Europe and ways in which reduction of such bases would affect 
        the ability of the United States to sustain military operations 
        abroad.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
