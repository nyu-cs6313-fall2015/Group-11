To amend section 9010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
 to delay the application of the health insurance provider annual fee 
until 2016 and to provide a process to return to consumers any amounts 
 attributable to the expected application of the annual fee to 2014 or 
                                 2015.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDER ANNUAL FEE DELAYED UNTIL 2016.

    (a) In General.--Section 9010 of the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``2013'' and 
        inserting ``2015'';
            (2) in subsection (e)(1), by striking the entries in the 
        table relating to 2014 and to 2015; and
            (3) in subsection (j), by striking ``2013'' and inserting 
        ``2015''.
    (b) Effective Date.--Except as provided in subsection (c), the 
amendments made by subsection (a) shall take effect as if included in 
section 9010 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
    (c) Return to Consumers of Amounts Attributable to Expected 
Application of Annual Fee to 2014 and 2015.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall issue guidance 
directing covered entities (as defined for purposes of section 9010 of 
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) to return any amounts 
collected from consumers or other sources that were attributed in State 
filings or otherwise to the annual fee which (as in effect prior to the 
enactment of this Act) was scheduled to be imposed on such entities 
under such section for 2014 and 2015. If the Secretary of the Treasury, 
in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
determines that any such entity has failed to comply with such guidance 
and such entity does not promptly cure such failure upon notice from 
the Secretary of the Treasury, the amendments made by this section 
shall not apply with respect to such entity.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
