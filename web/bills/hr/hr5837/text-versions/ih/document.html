                                 A BILL


 
   To provide for the establishment of a global affairs strategy and 
   assistance for people of African descent, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``African Descent Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The struggle to end discrimination against people of 
        African descent is a global challenge, and one that is central 
        to the United States commitment to human rights.
            (2) Targeted exclusion, violence, and discrimination 
        against people of African descent continues around the world.
            (3) Issues range from the fight for ancestral lands in 
        Latin America, hate crimes resulting in injury and death in 
        Europe, profiling and excessive use of force by law enforcement 
        in the United States, and continuing global disparities in 
        health, education, employment, housing, and other sectors.
            (4) It is imperative that the world actively address the 
        vestiges of slavery and colonialism that have long hindered 
        racial equality and justice and prevented the recognition of 
        the important contributions of people of African descent to the 
        world.
            (5) The International Decade for People of African Descent, 
        from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2025, offers an 
        opportunity to address these issues domestically and globally 
        through coordinated government and civil society strategies, 
        including the private sector.
