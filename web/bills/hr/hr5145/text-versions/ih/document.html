                                 A BILL


 
   To require breast density reporting to physicians and patients by 
      facilities that perform mammograms, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Density and Mammography 
Reporting Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The National Cancer Institute estimates that 1 in 8 
        women in the United States will develop a cancer of the breast 
        in their lifetime.
            (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 
        that breast cancer is the number one cause of cancer death 
        among Hispanic women, and the number two cause of cancer death 
        among White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American 
        Indian/Alaska Native women.
            (3) Individuals receiving mammograms are not currently 
        required to receive medical summaries or reports from their 
        mammogram providers which address breast density or its 
        correlation to masking the presence of breast cancer on 
        mammograms, despite the fact that the radiologist interpreting 
        the mammogram makes an assessment of the patient's breast 
        density.

SEC. 3. BREAST DENSITY REPORTING BY FACILITIES THAT PERFORM MAMMOGRAMS 
              TO PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS.

    (a) In General.--Clause (ii) of section 354(f)(1)(G) of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 263b(f)(1)(G)) is amended--
            (1) in each of subclauses (III) and (IV), by striking 
        ``and'' at the end; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
                            ``(V) the report under subclause (I) and 
                        the summary under subclause (IV) shall include 
                        information about breast density, as specified 
                        by the Secretary based upon--
                                    ``(aa) current scientific 
                                knowledge;
                                    ``(bb) technological advances; or
                                    ``(cc) other updated medical 
                                procedures where the use of such 
                                screening developments is consistent 
                                with the practice of medical experts in 
                                the field;
                            ``(VI) the summary under subclause (IV) 
                        shall convey the effect of breast density in 
                        masking the presence of breast cancer on 
                        mammography, using the provider's qualitative 
                        assessment of breast density; and
                            ``(VII) the summary under subclause (IV) 
                        shall include language, developed by the 
                        Secretary in consultation with leading experts 
                        and leading cancer organizations, communicating 
                        that individuals with dense breasts should talk 
                        with their physicians about--
                                    ``(aa) any questions or concerns 
                                regarding the summary; and
                                    ``(bb) whether the individuals 
                                would benefit from additional tests.''.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--This section and the amendments made by 
this section shall not be construed to alter in any way Federal 
requirements relating to financial obligations of any person in 
connection with health insurance.

SEC. 4. ENHANCING RESEARCH RELATING TO BREAST DENSITY.

    Title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting 
after section 354 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 263b) the following:

``SEC. 354A. ENHANCING RESEARCH RELATING TO BREAST DENSITY.

    ``The Secretary shall expand and intensify the programs and 
activities of the Department of Health and Human Services for 
conducting or supporting--
            ``(1) applied research on breast density;
            ``(2) research on the cost-effectiveness, effectiveness, 
        and feasibility of reimbursement models for supplemental 
        imaging relating to breast density; and
            ``(3) research in support of clinical guidelines and best
