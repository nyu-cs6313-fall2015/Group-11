Requires the summary to: (1) convey the effect of breast density in masking the presence of breast cancer on a mammogram, and (2) include language communicating that individuals with dense breasts should talk with their physicians about any questions or concerns regarding the summary and whether they would benefit from additional tests.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand and intensify research on breast density, the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of supplemental imaging relating to breast density, and best practices concerning mammograms and supplemental screening for those with dense breasts."
