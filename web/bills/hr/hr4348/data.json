Requires each public IHE, to the extent practicable, to include in its course schedule publication information on whether each listed course or program of study is part of its common general education core curriculum and is transferable for credit toward the completion of a degree at any public IHE with which it has an articulation agreement.\n\nRequires each public IHE, by July 1, 2017, to enter into an articulation agreement with the other public IHEs located in its state.\n\nRequires those agreements to include:\n\n a common general education core curriculum consisting of at least 30 credit hours or equivalent coursework that are fully transferable toward meeting specific degree or certificate requirements at other public IHEs in the state, common course numbering for substantially similar courses in that curriculum, and a guarantee that an associate degree in an academic major in the arts and sciences at a public IHE in the state will be credited as the first two years of a related baccalaureate program at other public IHEs in the state. Excepts Tribal Colleges or Universities from those articulation agreement requirements."
