                                 A BILL


 
 To preserve the Green Mountain Lookout in the Glacier Peak Wilderness 
             of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Green Mountain Lookout Heritage 
Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF LEGAL AUTHORITY OF GREEN MOUNTAIN LOOKOUT.

    (a) Legal Authority of Lookout.--Section 4(b) of the Washington 
State Wilderness Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-339; 98 Stat. 300; 16 
U.S.C. 1131 note) is amended by striking the period at the end and 
inserting the following: ``, and except that with respect to the lands 
described in section 3(5), the designation of such lands as a 
wilderness area shall not preclude the operation and maintenance of 
Green Mountain Lookout.''
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect as if included in the enactment of the Washington State 
Wilderness Act of 1984.

SEC. 3. PRESERVATION OF GREEN MOUNTAIN LOOKOUT LOCATION.

    The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the 
Forest Service, may not move Green Mountain Lookout from its current 
location on Green Mountain in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National 
Forest unless the Secretary determines that moving Green Mountain 
Lookout is necessary to preserve the Lookout or to ensure the safety of 
individuals on or around Green Mountain. If the Secretary makes such a 
determination, the Secretary shall move the Green Mountain Lookout to a 
location outside of the lands described in section 3(5) of the 
Washington State Wilderness Act of 1984 and designated as a wilderness 
area in section 4(b) of such Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
