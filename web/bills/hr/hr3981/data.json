Specifies the manner of conversion and the terms and conditions of prepayment.\n\nRequires the receipts generated from prepayment of contracts under this Act, beyond amounts necessary to cover the amount of receipts forgone from scheduled payments under current law for the 10-year period following the enactment of this Act, to be directed to the Reclamation Surface Water Storage Account. Requires the Secretary to allocate amounts in such Account to fund or provide loans for the construction of surface water storage for:\n\n increased municipal and industrial water supply; agricultural floodwater, erosion, and sedimentation reduction; agricultural drainage improvements; agricultural irrigation; increased recreation opportunities; reduced adverse impacts to fish and wildlife from water storage or diversion projects within watersheds associated with water storage projects funded under this Act; and other purposes consistent with reclamation laws or other federal law."
