  <summary>5/21/2014--Introduced.
Jumpstarting Occupational-learning and Entrepreneurship Act or the JOE Act - Amends the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to exempt school-based enterprises that are managed as part of a school's curriculum from the nutrition standards for foods sold in schools that are not foods provided under the school lunch and breakfast programs.

Defines a "school-based enterprise" as an entrepreneurial operation in a school setting that:

 provides goods or services to meet the needs of the market; is managed and operated by students as a hands-on learning laboratory; provides realistic and practical learning experiences that reinforce classroom instruction; may sell to consumers through a permanent location, a mobile kiosk, or through Internet marketing; and may sell products such as food and beverage items or provide services such as event catering.</summary>
