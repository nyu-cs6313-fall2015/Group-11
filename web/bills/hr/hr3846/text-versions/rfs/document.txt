SEC. 9. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE AWARD PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress established the Foreign Language Award Program 
        (FLAP) to incentivize employees at United States ports of entry 
        to utilize their foreign language skills on the job by 
        providing a financial incentive for the use of the foreign 
        language for at least ten percent of their duties after passage 
        of competency tests. FLAP incentivizes the use of more than two 
        dozen languages and has been instrumental in identifying and 
        utilizing United States Customs and Border Protection officers 
        and agents who are proficient in a foreign language.
            (2) In 1993, Congress provided for dedicated funding for 
        this program by stipulating that certain fees collected by 
        United States Customs and Border Protection to fund FLAP.
            (3) Through FLAP, foreign travelers are aided by having an 
        officer at a port of entry who speaks their language, and 
        United States Customs and Border Protection benefits by being 
        able to focus its border security efforts in a more effective 
        manner.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that FLAP 
incentivizes United States Customs and Border Protection officers and 
agents to attain and maintain competency in a foreign language, thereby 
improving the efficiency of operations for the functioning of United 
States Customs and Border Protection's security mission, making the 
United States a more welcoming place when foreign travelers find 
officers can communicate in their language, and helping to expedite 
traveler processing to reduce wait times.

SEC. 10. PROHIBITION ON NEW APPROPRIATIONS.
