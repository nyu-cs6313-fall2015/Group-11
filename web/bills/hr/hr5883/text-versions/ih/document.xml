			<subsection id="H1A9844797C4E427D85499266C731CEB0"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Findings</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Congress finds that American companies with foreign operations are accumulating earnings
			 totaling as much as one trillion dollars, not repatriated to the United
			 States due to corporate income taxes as high as 35 percent. As a result of
			 this penalty, U.S. companies invest their earnings in foreign countries
			 with little to no consequence. However, if invested internally, these
			 funds could spur the development of U.S. jobs, capital assets, research,
			 and more. Whereas most developed countries, such as Germany, the United
			 Kingdom, and France all have a tax on corporate profits earned
			 internationally ranging from 0 percent to 2 percent, the United States has
			 not followed this lead. Therefore, the Congress must adopt legislation
			 lowering the Federal tax on earnings of American companies with foreign
			 operations to 5 percent. Implementation of this change has the ability to
			 raise Federal tax revenue by $50 billion, helping to fund the trillion
			 dollar stimulus.</text>
