                                 A BILL


 
To authorize further assistance to Israel for the Iron Dome anti-rocket 
defense system and authorization for cooperation on the David's Sling, 
            Arrow, and Arrow 3 anti-missile defense systems.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Israel Missile Defense 
Cooperation Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The State of Israel remains under grave threat and 
        frequent attack from missiles, rockets, and mortar shells fired 
        at Israeli civilian targets by militants from Foreign Terrorist 
        Organizations such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad on 
        its southern border and by Hezbollah on its northern border, 
        which have killed, wounded, or inflicted psychological trauma 
        on countless Israelis. Additionally, Israel faces a potential 
        ballistic missile threat from Iran and Syria.
            (2) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation 
        Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) established the policy of 
        the United States to support the inherent right of Israel to 
        self-defense.
            (3) The United States remains committed to Israel's 
        qualitative military edge, including its advantage over non-
        state actors such as Hezbollah and Hamas, which boast 
        increasingly sophisticated and powerful weapons as a result of 
        support from Iran, Syria, and other state actors.
            (4) The United States can help to advance its own vital 
        national security interests and the cause of Middle Eastern 
        peace and stability by supporting Israel's ability to defend 
        itself against missiles, rockets, and other threats.
            (5) United States-Israel missile defense cooperation dates 
        back over two decades with great success, such as the Arrow 
        Weapon System, which is already protecting Israel. These 
        systems are life-saving, war-preventing and the technologies of 
        the cooperative programs belong to both the United States and 
        Israel.
            (6) United States industries are equal partners in the 
        development of the cooperative systems, which creates 
        employment opportunities in the United States and Israel. All 
        technical milestones to date have been met on time.
            (7) The David's Sling Weapon System (DSWS), in joint 
        development by the United States and Israel, is being designed 
        to intercept short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles, 
        long-range rockets, and cruise missiles.
            (8) The David's Sling Weapon System successfully 
        intercepted an inert medium-range rocket in November 2012, and 
        defense officials expect the program to be fully operational as 
        planned on time.
            (9) The Arrow 3 Weapon System, in joint development by the 
        United States and Israel, is being designed to intercept long-
        range missiles in high altitude in order to minimize leakage 
        from a nuclear or chemical warhead.
            (10) The Arrow 3 Weapon System completed a successful fly-
        out test in February 2013.
            (11) The Arrow Weapon System, in joint development between 
        the United States and Israel, has been operational since 2000 
        and targets medium-range ballistic missiles.
            (12) The Israeli Defense Forces report that the Iron Dome 
        anti-rocket defense system has achieved a success rate of more 
        than 85 percent, intercepting rockets bound for residential 
        neighborhoods, busy road junctions, shopping centers, and 
        crowded streets across Israel.
            (13) The success of the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense 
        system during Operation Pillar of Defense in November 2012 
        averted massive Israeli casualties, thereby decreasing Israel's 
        need to conduct a ground-based attack against Gaza-based 
        terrorists, enhancing Israel's operational flexibility, and 
        preventing terrorists from plunging the region into crisis 
        whenever they choose.
            (14) Israel has indicated that it is ready to share the 
        technology of the Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system with the 
        United States, which would strengthen United States defense 
        capabilities.
            (15) The Government of Israel currently has five 
        operational Iron Dome batteries deployed in the field, which 
        are far from sufficient to protect all of Israel's territory.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL FOR THE IRON DOME ANTI-
              ROCKET DEFENSE SYSTEM AND AUTHORIZATION FOR COOPERATION 
              ON THE DAVID'S SLING, ARROW, AND ARROW 3 ANTI-MISSILE 
              DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

    The President, acting through the Secretary of Defense and the 
Secretary of State, is authorized to provide assistance, upon request 
of the Government of Israel, for the procurement of the Iron Dome anti-
rocket defense system, as well as authorization for cooperation on the 
development, maintenance, enhancement, and sustainment of the David's 
Sling, Arrow, and Arrow 3 anti-missile defense systems, for the 
purposes of intercepting short-range, medium-range, and long-range 
rockets, missiles, and projectiles launched against Israel.
