Authorizes the NIST Director to support, promote, and coordinate activities and efforts to enhance awareness and understanding of measurement sciences, standards, and technology. Eliminates the manufacturing fellowship program and the teacher science and technology enhancement program.\n\nRequires the Director to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a review of NIST laboratory programs.\n\nDirects NIST to contract with the National Research Council (NRC) to assess the technical quality and impact of the work conducted at NIST laboratories. (Currently, NIST is authorized to contract with the NRC.)\n\n Makes revisions to the program known as the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership. Adds as a purpose of the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Centers the transfer of best business practices.\n\nRemoves the National Security Agency (NSA) from the list of agencies that NIST must consult in developing standards and guidelines for information systems."
