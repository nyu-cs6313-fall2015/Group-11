  <summary>10/28/2013--Introduced.
Early Childhood Education Professional Improvement Act of 2013 - Authorizes the Secretary of Education to award grants to states to:

 provide scholarships that enable preschool teachers employed in an early childhood education program to pursue a bachelor's degree in early childhood education or a closely related field; support preschool teachers employed in an early childhood education program to attain a credential, licensure, or endorsement that demonstrates competence in early childhood education if their bachelor's degree is not in that or a closely related field; increase the compensation of teachers who are making progress toward a degree in early childhood education or who have attained that degree; and provide ongoing professional development opportunities to preschool teachers and teacher assistants employed in an early childhood education program. Requires each state that desires a grant to include a description of its comprehensive early childhood professional development system in its application.

Requires grant recipients to maintain their fiscal effort for the activities supported by the grant funds for a fiscal year at levels equal to or greater than their fiscal effort for such activities during the preceding fiscal year.</summary>
