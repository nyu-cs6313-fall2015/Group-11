Requires each state that desires a grant to include a description of its comprehensive early childhood professional development system in its application.\n\nRequires grant recipients to maintain their fiscal effort for the activities supported by the grant funds for a fiscal year at levels equal to or greater than their fiscal effort for such activities during the preceding fiscal year."
