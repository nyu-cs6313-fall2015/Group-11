                                 A BILL


 
 To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to resolve the backlog of 
disability claims of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ending VA Claims Disability Backlog 
and Accountability Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is statutorily 
        obligated to provide to individuals who served in the Armed 
        Forces and sustained an injury as a direct result of such 
        service with health care, disability compensation, and related 
        resources.
            (2) Disability compensation payments are intended to 
        provide relief for some of the socioeconomic and other losses 
        veterans experience as a result of service-connected diseases 
        and injuries.
            (3) A recent review by the Government Accountability Office 
        found that the backlog of disability claims at the Department 
        of Veterans Affairs has more than tripled since 2009 and the 
        average length of time to complete a claim has increased from 
        161 days in 2009 to 260 days in 2012.
            (4) In August 2012, approximately 568,043 claims or two-
        thirds of all compensation rating claims are backlogged.
            (5) The Government Accountability Office found that delays 
        in obtaining service and medical records for veterans who 
        served in the National Guard or Reserve is a significant factor 
        in lengthening the claims process for these veterans even 
        though they make up 43 percent of veterans who served during 
        the Global War on Terrorism.
            (6) The Government Accountability Office found that if a 
        veteran submits a disability claim and reports receiving 
        disability benefits from the Social Security Administration, 
        the Department of Veterans Affairs is required to help the 
        veteran obtain relevant Federal records, including medical 
        records from the Social Security Administration to process the 
        claim.
            (7) There is an interagency agreement between the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security 
        Administration, but the protocols of the Department and the 
        response time of the Administration can take a year before the 
        Department has obtained the requested information.
            (8) The Government Accountability Office found that 
        approximately 50 percent of claims processing staff have been 
        in their current role for less than two years and are not yet 
        proficient in their duties requiring supervision and review 
        from more experienced claims processing staff, diverting them 
        from their claims processing responsibilities.
            (9) Veterans and their families have already selflessly and 
        willingly sacrificed for our nation and faced numerous 
        hardships; they should not have to continue to face undue and 
        avoidable hardships after their service as they seek the 
        benefits they earned.
            (10) On March 24, 2013, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
        Eric K. Shinseki stated in an interview on State of the Union 
        television show, ``no veteran should have to wait for claims as 
        they are today. We have a fix for this. We're open for 
        business. And we will end the backlog in 2015.''.
            (11) On April 15, 2013, the Secretary, in written testimony 
        before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate, again 
        stated that the ``VA remains focused on eliminating the 
        disability claims backlog in 2015 and processing all claims 
        within 125 days at a 98-percent accuracy level.''.
            (12) On April 19, 2013, the Secretary again stated in a New 
        York Times article titled ``V.A. Aims to Reduce Its Backlog of 
        Claims'', that the Department will ``eliminate the backlog by 
        2015.''.
            (13) Numerous congressional inquiries for progress reports 
        and detailed information regarding the disability claims 
        backlog remain unanswered, while the Secretary continues to 
        state the claims backlog will be eliminated by 2015, claims 
        processing accuracy will be increased to 98 percent, and claims 
        processing will take no longer than 125 days as a direct result 
        of the ``Strategic Plan to Eliminate the Compensation Claims 
        Backlog'' of the Department.
            (14) The Government Accountability Office found that the 
        ``Strategic Plan to Eliminate the Compensation Claims Backlog'' 
        of the Department does not adequately articulate how the 
        Department will meet its goals, and planning documents that the 
        Department provided does not meet the established criteria of 
        the Government Accountability Office for sound planning, 
        potentially leading to concerns about the ability of the 
        Department to reduce claims backlogs.
