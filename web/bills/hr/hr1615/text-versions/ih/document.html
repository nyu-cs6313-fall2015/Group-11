into such an arrangement, another appropriate entity) to conduct a

        children with severe and persistent mental illness;
            (2) barriers to receiving mental health services that 
        result in high rates of untreated mental illness; and
            (3) the availability of interventions such as assisted 
        outpatient treatment designed to reach individuals with 
        untreated severe mental illness.
    (c) Report.--The Secretary shall ensure that, not later than 12 
months after the date of enactment of this Act--
            (1) the study under subsection (a) is completed; and

        is submitted to the Congress.
