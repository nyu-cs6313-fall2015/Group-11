Requires termination of such status if the Secretary determines: (1) that the qualifying employment was intended as a means to evade U.S. immigration laws, or (2) other specified requirements were not met.\n\nSets forth the conditions for an alien to petition for permanent resident status.\n\nRevises worldwide levels of employment- and family-based based immigrants.\n\nMakes the the EB-5 regional center program permanent.\n\nEliminates: (1) the diversity immigrant program as of October 1, 2013, (2) the provision requiring the reduction of annual People's Republic of China immigrant visas to offset status adjustments under the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992, and (3) the per-country limit for employment-based immigrants. Increases, however, the per-country limit for family-based immigrants.\n\nMakes the J-1 visa waiver (Conrad state 30/medical services in underserved areas) program permanent.\n\nIncreases the number of alien physicians that a state may be allocated from 30 to 35 per fiscal year.\n\nProvides up to three visa waivers per fiscal year per state for physicians in academic medical centers.\n\nExtends dual intent to aliens coming to the United States to receive graduate medical education or training, or to take examinations required for such education or training.\n\nSets forth specified employment protections and contract requirements for alien physicians working in underserved areas.\n\nExcludes from numerical immigration limitations alien physicians who have completed national interest waiver requirements by working in a health care shortage area.\n\nIncreases the H-1B (specialty occupation) nonimmigrant visa limitation to 155,000 per fiscal year beginning in FY2014.\n\nReplaces the current higher education degree exemption from H-1B limitations with an exemption for up to 40,000 aliens with a STEM master's or doctorate degree (EB-6 and EB-7 aliens).\n\nDirects the Secretary to verify the authenticity of foreign educational degrees. Authorizes a related employer fee.\n\nEstablishes in the Treasury the H-1B Educational Credential Verification Account.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of Labor to issue subpoenas to employers of H-1B, H-1B1(specialty workers pursuant to agreements with Chile or Singapore), and E-3 (specialty worker pursuant to a treaty of commerce) nonimmigrants.\n\nSets forth wage and working condition requirements for employers of: (1) Mexican or Canadian professionals, and (2) specialized knowledge L-visa aliens (intracompany transferees) who will be employed for more than six months over a three-year period.\n\nProvides portability for O-1 visa nonimmigrants (extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, athletics, or the arts or films or television).\n\nExtends dual intent to foreign students who: (1) are coming to the United States to pursue STEM field degrees at institutions of higher education that have agreed to report the attendance of each nonimmigrant student to DHS, or (2) are engaged in temporary post graduation employment for optional practical training related to such study.\n\nPermits specified nonimmigrant aliens granted employment authorization to continue employment with the same employer for up to 240 days while an application for extension of stay is adjudicated.\n\nIncreases H-1B employer fees.
