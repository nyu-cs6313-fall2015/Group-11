    It is the sense of the Congress that:

        economy is strongly linked to the ability of our schools to 
        educate students in the science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics (STEM) subjects.
            (2) A portion of application fees paid by employers seeking 
        to hire foreign workers should be devoted to supporting 
        improvements in STEM education in the United States, including 
        computer science education, at the elementary, secondary, and 
        university levels in order to reduce our dependence on foreign 
        workers over time.
            (3) Such funds should be used to support--
                    (A) building the capacity of every State to improve 
                student achievement in STEM subjects, especially in the 
                most high-need school districts;
                    (B) supporting innovation in STEM education through 
                partnerships between elementary and secondary schools, 
                universities, non-profits, businesses, and informal 
                education and community-based partners;
                    (C) broadening the diversity and capacity of the 
                STEM education pipeline in the United States through 
                scholarships and other forms of assistance to American 
                students who study in these subjects; and
                    (D) improving and promoting STEM education for 
                underrepresented populations, including economically 
                disadvantaged individuals in STEM fields.
