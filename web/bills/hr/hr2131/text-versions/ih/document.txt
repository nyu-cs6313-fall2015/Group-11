                        unemployment rate of at least 150 of the 
                        national average rate. Such an area must fit 
                        entirely within a geographical unit that the 
                        Secretary of Labor has determined has an 
                        unemployment rate of at least 150 percent of 
                        the national average rate (and which 
                        determination has not been superseded by a

                        unemployment rate of at least 150 percent of 
                        the national average rate). The Secretary of 
                        Labor shall set forth a uniform methodology for 
                        determining whether an area an area qualifies 
                        as having experienced unemployment of at least 
                        150 percent of the national average rate. It 
                        shall be within the discretion of the Secretary 
                        of Homeland Security to determine whether any 
                        particular area has experienced high 
                        unemployment for purposes of this paragraph, 
                        and the Secretary shall not be bound by the 
                        determination of any other governmental or 
                        nongovernmental entity that a particular area 
                        has experienced high unemployment for purposes 
                        of this paragraph.''.
