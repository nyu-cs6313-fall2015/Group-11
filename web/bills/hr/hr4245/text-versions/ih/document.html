  TITLE III--ENHANCING PUBLIC ACCESS TO CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE

SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Public Access to 
Congressional Research Service Reports Resolution of 2014'' or the 
``Congressional Research Service Electronic Accessibility Resolution of 
2014''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Congressional Research Service, a special reference 
        unit within the Library of Congress, offers invaluable research 
        and analysis to Members of Congress on all current and emerging 
        issues of national policy.
            (2) The Congressional Research Service staff of 
        approximately 700 employees, including lawyers, economists, 
        reference librarians, and social, natural, and physical 
        scientists, are governed by requirements for accuracy, 
        objectivity, balance, and nonpartisanship.
            (3) The Congressional Research Service has a responsibility 
        to ensure that Members of Congress have available the best 
        possible information and analysis on which to base the policy 
        decisions the American people have elected them to make.
            (4) It is often burdensome, difficult, and time-consuming 
        for citizens to obtain access to objective and nonpartisan 
        policy analysis on issues affecting their interests.
            (5) It will enhance our democracy to provide citizens with 
        access to unbiased and accurate CRS documents on legislation 
        and other critical issues before Congress.
            (6) Allowing public access to CRS will empower citizens and 
        enable Members of Congress to become even more effective 
        ``representatives'' of the public's concerns and goals.
