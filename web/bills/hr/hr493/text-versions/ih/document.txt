To prohibit funds appropriated for the Department of Homeland Security 
    from being used to pay for an abortion, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Respect for Life 
Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON EXPENDITURE OF FEDERAL FUNDS BY SECRETARY OF 
              HOMELAND SECURITY.

    (a) In General.--None of the funds appropriated for the Department 
of Homeland Security under any Federal law shall be available to pay 
for any abortion, except--
            (1) in a case where a pregnant detainee suffers from a 
        physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that 
        would, as certified by a physician, place the pregnant detainee 
        in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a 
        life-endangering physical condition caused by, or arising from, 
        pregnancy itself, or in a case of rape or incest; and
            (2) that if this subsection is declared unconstitutional by 
        a court of competent jurisdiction, this subsection shall be 
        null and void.
    (b) No Person Required To Perform Services.--None of the funds 
appropriated for the Department of Homeland Security under any Federal 
law shall be used to require any person to perform, or facilitate in 
any way the performance of, any abortion.
    (c) Construction.--Nothing in subsection (b) shall remove any legal 
obligation the Secretary of Homeland Security may have to provide 
escort services necessary for a pregnant detainee to receive such 
service outside a Federal detention facility, except that nothing in 
this subsection in any way diminishes the effect of subsection (b) in 
upholding the right of any individual to refrain from involvement in 
abortion.
                                 <all>
