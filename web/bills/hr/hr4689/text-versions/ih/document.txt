                for the storage of rail cars on the tracks specified in 
                the plan, including an explanation of why no suitable 
                alternative site for storage of the rail cars exists;

        complete plan under this section, the Board, after public 
        notice and an opportunity for public comment, shall approve or 
        disapprove the plan. The Board shall approve the plan unless 
        the Board determines that the storage of rail cars covered by 
        the plan jeopardizes public safety, including the safety of 
        children. Any such determination shall be based on information 
        provided in the plan, by the local community, or otherwise 
        through public comment.

        for such storage approved by the Board under subsection (b)(2).

                temporary storage of rail cars as described in 
                subsection (a) for a period before a plan has been 
                approved under subsection (b)(2) if the Board

                submitted, or is being prepared for submittal in a 
                timely manner, for approval under subsection (b).

                temporary storage under this paragraph if the Board 
                finds, on its own initiative or pursuant to information 
                provided by the local community, that such storage 
                poses a significant safety hazard, including to the
