			 fair competition has made the United States the strongest economy in the

			 health insurance issuers are subject to the same antitrust and unfair trade
			 practices laws that all businesses have had to comply with and to more
			 effectively ensure that these issuers would be subject to Federal laws against
			 price fixing, bid rigging, or market allocations to the detriment of
			 competition and consumers. This Act remedies a special exemption provided by
			 Congress in 1945 to respond to the United States Supreme Court decision
			 entitled United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association, wherein the
			 Court correctly held that the Federal Government could regulate insurance
			 companies under the authority of the commerce clause in the Constitution. This
			 Act would also retain enforcement of these laws with State and Federal law
			 enforcement agencies and allow private causes of action by aggrieved consumers
			 harmed by unfair trade practices.</text>
