Secretary in accordance with the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et 
seq.), except that--
            (1) any reference in that Act to the effective date of that 
        Act shall be considered to be a reference to the date of 
        enactment of this Act; and
            (2) any reference in that Act to the Secretary of 
        Agriculture shall be considered to be a reference to the 
        Secretary.
    (b) Livestock.--Within the wilderness area designated by this Act, 
the grazing of livestock in areas administered by the Bureau of Land 
Management in which grazing is established as of the date of enactment 
of this Act shall be allowed to continue--
            (1) subject to such reasonable regulations, policies, and 
        practices as the Secretary considers to be necessary; and
            (2) consistent with section 4(d)(4) of the Wilderness Act

    (c) Incorporation of Acquired Land and Interests.--Any land or 
interest in land within the boundaries of the area designated as 
wilderness by this Act that is acquired by the United States after the 
date of enactment of this Act shall be added to and administered as 
part of the wilderness area.
    (d) Water Rights.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) the land designated as wilderness by this Act 
                is located--
                            (i) in the semiarid region of the Great 
                        Basin; and
                            (ii) at the headwaters of the streams and 
                        rivers on land with respect to which there are 
                        few, if any--
                                    (I) actual or proposed water 
                                resource facilities located upstream; 
                                and
                                    (II) opportunities for diversion, 
                                storage, or other uses of water 
                                occurring outside the land that would 
                                adversely affect the wilderness values 
                                of the land;
                    (B) the land designated as wilderness by this Act 
                is generally not suitable for use or development of new 
                water resource facilities; and
                    (C) because of the unique nature of the land 
                designated as wilderness by this Act, it is possible to 
                provide for proper management and protection of the 
                wilderness and other values of land in ways different 
                from those used in other laws.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to protect the 
        wilderness values of the land designated as wilderness by this 
        Act by means other than a federally reserved water right.
            (3) Statutory construction.--Nothing in this Act--
                    (A) constitutes an express or implied reservation 
                by the United States of any water or water rights with 
                respect to a wilderness designated by this Act;
                    (B) affects any water rights in the State 
                (including any water rights held by the United States) 
                in existence on the date of enactment of this Act;
                    (C) establishes a precedent with regard to any 
                future wilderness designations;
                    (D) affects the interpretation of, or any 
                designation made under, any other Act; or
                    (E) limits, alters, modifies, or amends any 
                interstate compact or equitable apportionment decree 
                that apportions water among and between the State and 
                other States.
            (4) Nevada water law.--The Secretary shall follow the 
        procedural and substantive requirements of State law in order 
        to obtain and hold any water rights not in existence on the 
        date of enactment of this Act with respect to the wilderness 
        area designated by this Act.
            (5) New projects.--

                            (i) In general.--In this paragraph, the 
                        term ``water resource facility'' means 
                        irrigation and pumping facilities, reservoirs, 
                        water conservation works, aqueducts, canals, 
                        ditches, pipelines, wells, hydropower projects, 
                        transmission and other ancillary facilities, 
                        and other water diversion, storage, and 
                        carriage structures.
                            (ii) Exclusion.--In this paragraph, the 
                        term ``water resource facility'' does not 
                        include wildlife guzzlers.
                    (B) Restriction on new water resource facilities.--
                Except as otherwise provided in this Act, on or after 
                the date of enactment of this Act, neither the 
                President nor any other officer, employee, or agent of 
                the United States shall fund, assist, authorize, or 
                issue a license or permit for the development of any 
                new water resource facility within a wilderness area, 
                any portion of which is located in the County.

SEC. 6. ADJACENT MANAGEMENT.

    (a) In General.--Congress does not intend for the designation of 
land as wilderness by this Act to create a protective perimeter or 
buffer zone around the wilderness area.
    (b) Nonwilderness Activities.--The fact that nonwilderness 
activities or uses can be seen or heard from areas within the 
wilderness designated by this Act shall not preclude the conduct of the 
activities or uses outside the boundary of the wilderness area.

    Nothing in this Act restricts or precludes--
            (1) low-level overflights of military aircraft over the

        overflights that can be seen or heard within the wilderness 
        area;
            (2) flight testing and evaluation; or
            (3) the designation or creation of new units of special use

        tribal activities, including spiritual, cultural, and 
        traditional food-gathering activities.

SEC. 9. RELEASE OF WILDERNESS STUDY AREAS.

    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that, for the purposes of section 603 
of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1782), 
the Bureau of Land Management land in any portion of the Blue Lakes and 
Alder Creek wilderness study areas not designated as wilderness by

wildlife management, including the regulation of hunting, fishing, and 
trapping, in the wilderness area designated by this Act.
    (b) Management Activities.--In furtherance of the purposes and 
principles of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), management 
activities to maintain or restore fish and wildlife populations and the 
habitats to support the populations may be carried out within the 
wilderness area designated by this Act, if the activities are carried 
out--
            (1) consistent with relevant wilderness management plans; 
        and
            (2) in accordance with--

                    (B) appropriate policies, such as those set forth 
                in Appendix B of House Report 101-405, including the 
                occasional and temporary use of motorized vehicles if 
                the use, as determined by the Secretary, would promote 
                healthy, viable, and more naturally distributed 
                wildlife populations that would enhance wilderness 
                values with the minimal impact necessary to reasonably 
                accomplish those tasks.
    (c) Existing Activities.--Consistent with section 4(d)(1) of the 
Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1133(d)(1)) and in accordance with 
appropriate policies such as those set forth in Appendix B of House

(f), the Secretary shall authorize structures and facilities, including 
existing structures and facilities, for wildlife water development 
projects, including guzzlers, in the wilderness areas designated by 
section 4(a) if--
            (1) the structures and facilities will, as determined by 
        the Secretary, enhance wilderness values by promoting healthy, 
        viable, and more naturally distributed wildlife populations; 
        and
            (2) the visual impacts of the structures and facilities on 
        the wilderness areas can reasonably be minimized.
    (e) Hunting, Fishing, and Trapping.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may designate, by 
        regulation, areas in which, and establish periods during which, 
        for reasons of public safety, administration, or compliance

        permitted in the wilderness areas designated by section 4(a).
            (2) Consultation.--Except in emergencies, the Secretary

                amendments to the cooperative agreement agreed to by 
                the Secretary and the State; and
                    (B) subject to all applicable laws (including
