    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Clean Energy 
Financing Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration shall establish a program under which the Administrator 
is authorized to guarantee the loans of small business concerns that 
manufacture a clean energy technology in the United States.
    (b) Administration.--Except as otherwise specified in this section 
and to the extent practicable, the Administrator shall carry out the 
program under subsection (a) in a manner similar to the loan program 
under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)).
    (c) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:
            (1) Clean energy technology.--The term ``clean energy 
        technology'' means a technology related to the production, use, 
        transmission, storage, control, or conservation of energy that 
        will contribute to a stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse 
        gas concentrations through reduction, avoidance, or 
        sequestration of energy-related emissions and--
                    (A) reduce the need for additional energy supplies 
                by using existing energy supplies with greater 
                efficiency or by transmitting, distributing, or 
                transporting energy with greater effectiveness through 
                the infrastructure of the United States; or
                    (B) diversify the sources of the energy supply of 
                the United States to strengthen energy security and to 
                increase supplies with a favorable balance of 
                environmental effects if the entire technology system 
                is considered.
            (2) Small business concern.--The term ``small business 
        concern'' has the meaning given that term under section 3(a) of 
        the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)).
