Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment Act or the Military SAVE Act - Requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to each operate a program that ensures that veterans and members of the armed forces may receive treatment from private providers for military sexual trauma.

Requires the Secretaries: (1) after receiving from a veteran or member electing such treatment a notification that includes a written affidavit stating that the individual is a victim of military sexual trauma, to assign a voucher that such individual may use to receive such treatment; and (2) to require such individual to make a reelection during each 120-day period in which such a voucher is used following the initial 120-day period the voucher is valid.</summary>
