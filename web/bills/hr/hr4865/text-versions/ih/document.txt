    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Family Coverage Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    Notwithstanding the amendments made by section 3, it is the sense 
of Congress that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the 
Secretary of the Treasury, within their respective jurisdictions, have 
the administrative authority necessary to apply the affordability 
provision in section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in such a 
manner as to expand access to affordable health insurance coverage for 
working families without further legislation.

                                minimum essential coverage if such

                                5000A(e)(1)(B)(i), determined by
