SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Marijuana Businesses Access to

SEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

    A Federal banking regulator may not--
                    (1) terminate or limit the deposit insurance of a 
                depository institution under the Federal Deposit 
                Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.) solely because 
                the depository institution provides or has provided 
                financial services to a marijuana-related legitimate 
                business;
                    (2) prohibit, penalize, or otherwise discourage a 
                depository institution from providing financial 
                services to a marijuana-related legitimate business;
                    (3) recommend, incentivize, or encourage a 
                depository institution not to offer financial services 
                to an individual, or to downgrade or cancel the 
                financial services offered to an individual solely 
                because--
                            (A) the individual is a manufacturer or 
                        producer, or is the owner or operator of a 
                        marijuana-related legitimate business;
                            (B) the individual later becomes an owner 
                        or operator of a marijuana-related legitimate 
                        business; or
                            (C) the depository institution was not 
                        aware that the individual is the owner or 
                        operator of a marijuana-related legitimate 
                        business; and
                    (4) take any action on a loan to an owner or 
                operator of--
                            (A) a marijuana-related legitimate 
                        business; or
                            (B) real estate or equipment that is leased 
                        to a marijuana-related legitimate business.

SEC. 3. PROTECTIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

    (a) Investigation and Prosecution.--A depository institution that 
provides financial services to a marijuana-related legitimate business, 
and the officers, directors, and employees of that depository 
institution, shall be immune from Federal criminal prosecution or 
investigation for providing those services.
    (b) Federal Criminal Law.--A depository institution that provides 
financial services to a marijuana-related legitimate business may not 
be held liable pursuant to any Federal criminal law solely for 
providing those services or for further investing any income derived 
from such services.
    (c) Forfeiture.--A depository institution that has a legal interest 
in the collateral for a loan made to an owner or operator of a 
marijuana-related legitimate business, or to an owner or operator of 
real estate or equipment that is leased to a marijuana-related 
legitimate business, shall not be subject to criminal, civil, or 
administrative forfeiture of that legal interest pursuant to any 
Federal law for providing such loan.

SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    Nothing in this Act shall require a depository institution to 
provide financial services to a marijuana-related legitimate business.

SEC. 5. EXEMPTION FROM FILING SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS.

    Section 5318(g) of title 31, United States Code, is amended by 
adding at the end the following:

        businesses.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary shall not require

                report a transaction as suspicious solely because a 
                party to the transaction is a marijuana-related 
                legitimate business.
                    ``(B) Definitions.--In this paragraph, the terms
