  <summary>1/29/2014--Introduced.
Amends the definition of a "dependent" who is eligible for enrollment under the TRICARE Program of members and former members of the Armed Forces (members) to include a child or custodial dependent who is under age 26 (currently, under age 21).

Allows for the continuation until age 26 of dependent medical and dental contract coverage when a member dies while on active duty for a period of more than 30 days.

Expresses the sense of Congress that any increase in expenditures of funds by reason of the enactment of this Act should be fully offset by reducing expenditures of funds for U.S. foreign assistance programs other than programs for Israel.</summary>
