                fraudulent use of a social security account number on a 
                statement described in section 6051--
                            ``(i) the Secretary shall disclose to the 
                        holder of such social security account number--
                                    ``(I) that the Secretary has reason 
                                to believe that the social security

Theft.--Section 6051 of such Code is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:

security account number of such employee, such employer--
            ``(1) shall cease to include such social security account 
        number on statements provided to the employee under subsection 
        (a), but
