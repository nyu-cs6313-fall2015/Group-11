                                 A BILL


 
To direct the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to plan to 
 return to the Moon and develop a sustained human presence on the Moon.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reasserting American Leadership in 
Space Act'' or the ``REAL Space Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The 109th Congress passed the National Aeronautics and 
        Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 overwhelmingly, 
        establishing as the National Aeronautics and Space 
        Administration's priority human space flight goal: ``To develop 
        a sustained human presence on the Moon . . . to promote 
        exploration, commerce, science, and United States preeminence 
        in space as a stepping stone for the future exploration of Mars 
        and other destinations.''.
            (2) The 110th Congress overwhelmingly reaffirmed the vision 
        of returning to the Moon as an integral part of exploring 
        further into our solar system through the passage of the 
        National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act 
        of 2008, expressing support for ``the broad goals of the space 
        exploration policy of the United States, including the eventual 
        return to and exploration of the Moon and other destinations in 
        the solar system and the important national imperative of 
        independent access to space''.
            (3) The 111th Congress, in the National Aeronautics and 
        Space Administration Authorization Act of 2010, called for the 
        development of a heavy lift capability of greater than 130 
        metric tons consisting of the Space Launch System (SLS) and 
        Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) to pursue exploration, yet 
        fell short on explicitly stating a clear destination.
            (4) The 112th Congress has reaffirmed this commitment to 
        the development of a heavy lift capability.
            (5) A sustained human presence on the Moon will allow 
        astronauts and researchers the opportunity to leverage new 
        technologies in addressing the challenges of sustaining life on 
        another celestial body, lessons which are necessary and 
        applicable as we explore further into our solar system, to Mars 
        and beyond.
            (6) A sustained human presence on the Moon would once again 
        inspire and engage public interest in our space program, 
        motivating young people to excel in the vital subjects of math 
        and science, subjects in which American students lag behind our 
        international competitors.
            (7) A sustained human presence on the Moon would challenge 
        American industry to continue to develop technologies that not 
        only enhance our exploration programs but can be applied across 
        all disciplines of science.
            (8) The commercial applications of space technologies have 
        had tens of billions of dollars in economic impact, including 
        products from semiconductors and aircraft controls to scratch-
        resistant lenses and water purification systems.
            (9) The healthcare technologies derived from our space 
        program, such as the portable x-ray machine, the MRI, advanced 
        life-saving diagnostics, and the implantable heart aid, have 
        saved and improved countless lives.
            (10) Space is the world's ultimate high ground, returning 
        to the Moon and reinvigorating our human space flight program 
        is a matter of national security.
            (11) Technologies developed and sustained by the National 
        Aeronautics and Space Administration's human space flight 
        program, such as liquid and solid rocket propulsion, 
        environmental and life support systems, and communications, 
        navigation, and control systems are important to our military.
            (12) China and Russia, understanding the economic and 
        strategic importance of human space flight, have declared their 
        intentions of colonizing the Moon and are advancing their lunar 
        exploration plans.
            (13) It is strategically important that the United States 
        possess and maintain the capabilities of unfettered operation 
        in the space domain, and not cede the space domain to other 
        nations.

SEC. 3. MISSION.

    In accordance with the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration Authorization Act of 2005, which established as the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's priority goal: ``To 
develop a sustained human presence on the Moon . . . to promote 
exploration, commerce, science, and United States preeminence in space 
as a stepping stone for the future exploration of Mars and other 
destinations.'', and in accordance with the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008, which endorsed ``the 
broad goals of the space exploration policy of the United States, 
including the eventual return to and exploration of the Moon and other 
destinations in the solar system and the important national imperative 
of independent access to space'', the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration shall plan to return to the Moon by 2022 and develop a 
sustained human presence on the Moon, in order to promote exploration, 
commerce, science, and United States preeminence in space as a stepping 
stone for the future exploration of Mars and other destinations. The 
budget requests and expenditures of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration shall be consistent with achieving this goal.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
