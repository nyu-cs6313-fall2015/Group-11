SEC. 4. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The fraudulent or illegal imports of textile and 
        apparel articles into the United States results in significant 
        revenue loss to the Department of the Treasury.
            (2) The Textile and Trade Agreements division of the Office 
        of International Trade within U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection or any subsequent division has, with respect to 
        textile or apparel articles, the primary responsibility to 
        ensure the proper enforcement of all customs and trade laws, 
        rules, and regulations affecting textile and apparel articles.
            (3) The TTA has the authority to direct the implementation 
        and enforcement of free trade agreements, multilateral 
        agreements, bilateral textile agreements, trade preference 
        programs, and all other customs and trade laws affecting 
        textiles and apparel articles.
            (4) The primary focus of the TTA is to ensure the effective 
        implementation of all trade enforcement activities involving 
        textile or apparel articles with its principle focus to prevent 
        circumvention of the requirements to obtain preferential trade 
        treatment under free trade agreements and trade preference 
        programs in order to avoid quotas or duties.

SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the TTA should 
        be involved in supporting the negotiation of enforcement 
        provisions of trade preference programs and free trade 
        agreements affecting textiles and apparel articles;
            (2) the TTA should conduct outreach to other Federal 
        departments and agencies involved in overall trade policy, such 
        as Department of Commerce and the Office of the United States 
        Trade Representative;
            (3) the TTA should develop policies and procedures that 
        provide guidance to the CEE and to the ports of entry of the 
        textile and apparel articles, including training of officials 
        of U.S. Customs and Border Protection;
            (4) officials of the TTA should coordinate and collaborate 
        with officials of the CEE to establish enforcement priorities, 
        based on risk assessments, and a national enforcement response;
            (5) the TTA headquarters office is currently below its 
        optimal staffing levels and the TTA personnel efforts should be 
        targeted at retaining senior staff and hiring new qualified 
        personnel so that the division is brought up to optimal 
        staffing levels, and these positions should be designated as 
        not only policy positions, but enforcement positions as well;
            (6) the TTA should implement special operations, Textile 
        Product Verification Teams, and other actions under U.S. 
        Customs and Border Protection authority to ensure enforcement 
        of customs and trade laws relating to imports of textile or 
        apparel articles in a timely manner as concerns arise, 
        particularly as such concerns relate to enforcement of the 
        North American Free Trade Agreement, the Dominican Republic-
        Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement, and all 
        other free trade agreements and trade preference programs, in 
        order to prevent transshipments and origin fraud;
            (7) the TTA officials should coordinate and collaborate 
        with foreign government counterparts to ensure effective 
        enforcement of textile and apparel articles; and
            (8) U.S. Customs and Border Protection should ensure that 
        seizures, detentions, special operations, and TPVTs remain the 
        primary focus of its enforcement efforts relating to textile 
        and apparel articles.
