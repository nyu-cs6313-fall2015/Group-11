                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit congressional recesses until Congress adopts a concurrent 
 resolution on the budget that results in a balanced Federal budget by 
               fiscal year 2024, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Do Your Job Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal debt exceeds $17,000,000,000,000 and 
        continues to grow.
            (2) It is the responsibility of Members of Congress to 
        enact and implement policies that encourage economic growth and 
        job creation, including a balanced budget.
            (3) In 2013, the House of Representatives was in session 
        only 160 days and the Senate was in session only 156 days.
            (4) Congressional recess in a time of excessive national 
        debt is a lost opportunity to reach agreement about a balanced 
        budget.

SEC. 3. NO CONGRESSIONAL RECESSES.

    (a) In General.--During the period beginning on the date of 
enactment of this Act and ending on the date specified in subsection 
(b), neither the Senate nor the House of Representatives may recess or 
stand adjourned for a period of longer than 24 hours.
    (b) Balanced Budget Agreed to.--The date described in this 
subsection is the date a concurrent resolution on the budget is agreed 
to that establishes a level of deficit of $0 or a surplus by not later 
than fiscal year 2024.
    (c) Rules of House of Representatives and Senate.--This section is 
enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, and it 
        supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is 
        inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.

SEC. 4. HOUSE AND SENATE APPROVAL OF REGULAR APPROPRIATION BILLS.

    Section 312 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended by 
adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(g) House and Senate Approval of Regular Appropriation Bills.--
            ``(1) Point of order in the house of representatives 
        against adjourning in august until house passage of all 
        appropriation bills.--It shall not be in order in the House of 
        Representatives to consider any resolution providing for an 
        adjournment period of more than three calendar days during the 
        month of August until the House of Representatives has approved 
        annual appropriation bills providing new budget authority under 
        the jurisdiction of all the subcommittees of the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the House of Representatives for the fiscal 
        year beginning on October 1 of such year.
            ``(2) Points of order in the house of representatives and

        appropriation bills.--Beginning on October 1 of a session of 
        Congress and during the duration of that session, it shall not 
        be in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to 
        consider any resolution providing for an adjournment period of 
        more than three calendar days for the duration of that session 
        until the annual appropriation bills providing new budget 
        authority under the jurisdiction of all the subcommittees of 
        the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate for the fiscal year beginning on 
        October 1 of such year have been presented to the President 
        under section 7 of article I of the Constitution.''.
                                 <all>
