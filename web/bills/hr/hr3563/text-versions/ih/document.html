United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Employees Responsible 
Investment Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Department of Labor has asserted that socially 
        responsible investments meet the fiduciary standards set in the 
        Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
            (2) Eighty-four percent of mutual fund investors would be 
        more likely to invest in a fund if one of its principles was to 
        invest in companies that engage in ethical business practices 
        in terms of operations and reporting.
            (3) Seventy-one percent of investors agree that companies 
        that operate with higher levels of integrity carry less 
        investment risk, and 67 percent of investors believe that these 
        companies deliver better investment returns.
            (4) The United States National Research Council has 
        established that human activity is largely responsible for 
        recent climate change and threatens significant harm to our 
        Nation's public health and welfare, security, agriculture and 
        forestry, natural resources, infrastructure, and economy.
            (5) In 2012, $3,740,000,000,000 was invested in socially 
        responsible funds in the United States.

value of all shares of that stock by the aggregate market value of all 
shares of all stocks included in such index (or indexes).''.
