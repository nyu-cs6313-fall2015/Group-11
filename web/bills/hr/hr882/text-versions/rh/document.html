SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Contracting and Tax Accountability 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. GOVERNMENTAL POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States Government that no Government 
contracts or grants should be awarded to individuals or companies with 
seriously delinquent Federal tax debts.

SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE AND EVALUATION OF CONTRACT OFFERS FROM DELINQUENT 
              FEDERAL DEBTORS.

    (a) In General.--The head of any executive agency that issues an 
invitation for bids or a request for proposals for a contract in an 
amount greater than the simplified acquisition threshold shall require 
each person that submits a bid or proposal to submit with the bid or 
proposal a form--
            (1) certifying that the person does not have a seriously 
        delinquent tax debt; and
            (2) authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose 
        to the head of the agency information limited to describing 
        whether the person has a seriously delinquent tax debt.
    (b) Impact on Responsibility Determination.--The head of any 
executive agency, in evaluating any offer received in response to a 
solicitation issued by the agency for bids or proposals for a contract, 
shall consider a certification that the offeror has a seriously 
delinquent tax debt to be definitive proof that the offeror is not a 
responsible source as defined in section 113 of title 41, United States 
Code.
    (c) Debarment.--
            (1) Requirement.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        head of an executive agency shall propose a person for 
        debarment after receiving an offer for a contract from such 
        person if--
                    (A) such offer contains a certification (as 
                required under subsection (a)(1)) that such person has 
                a seriously delinquent tax debt; or
                    (B) the head of the agency receives information 
                from the Secretary of the Treasury (as authorized under 
                subsection (a)(2)) demonstrating that such a 
                certification submitted by such person is false.
            (2) Waiver.--The head of an executive agency may waive 
        paragraph (1) with respect to a person based upon a written 
        finding of urgent and compelling circumstances significantly 
        affecting the interests of the United States. If the head of an 
        executive agency waives paragraph (1) for a person, the head of 
        the agency shall submit to Congress, within 30 days after the 
        waiver is made, a report containing the rationale for the 
        waiver and relevant information supporting the waiver decision.
    (d) Release of Information.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall 
make available to all executive agencies a standard form for the 
authorization described in subsection (a).
    (e) Revision of Regulations.--Not later than 270 days after the 
date of enactment of this subsection, the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation shall be revised to incorporate the requirements of this 
section.

        delinquent tax debt; and
            (2) authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to disclose 
        to the head of the executive agency information limited to 
        describing whether the person has a seriously delinquent tax 
        debt.
    (b) Impact on Determination of Financial Stability.--The head of 
any executive agency, in evaluating any application for a grant offered 
by the agency, shall consider a certification that the grant applicant 
has a seriously delinquent tax debt to be definitive proof that the 
applicant is high-risk and, if the applicant is awarded the grant, 
shall take appropriate measures under guidelines issued by the Office 
of Management and Budget for enhanced oversight of high-risk grantees.
    (c) Debarment.--
            (1) Requirement.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        head of an executive agency shall propose a person for 
        debarment after receiving a grant application from such person 
        if--

        executive agency waives paragraph (1) for a person, the head of 
        the agency shall submit to Congress, within 30 days after the 
        waiver is made, a report containing the rationale for the
