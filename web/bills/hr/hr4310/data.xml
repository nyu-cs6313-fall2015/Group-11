  <summary>3/26/2014--Introduced.
Ready to Work Act - Directs the Secretary of Labor, not later than one year after enactment of this Act, to issue a final rule pursuant to the Social Security Act that allows a state to enact legislation to test an applicant for unemployment compensation for use of controlled substances as a condition for receiving such compensation, if that applicant is an individual for whom suitable work is only available in an occupation that regularly conducts drug testing.

Prescribes a special rule providing that, if the Secretary has not issued an interim final rule within 180 days after enactment of this Act, the final rule shall require the state unemployment compensation agency to determine whether an occupation regularly conducts drug testing.</summary>
