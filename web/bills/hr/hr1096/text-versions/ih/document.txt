                                 A BILL


 
      To provide funds to State courts for the provision of legal 
  representation to parents and legal guardians with respect to child 
                             welfare cases.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing the Quality of Parental 
Legal Representation Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 
        2000, the Congress found that ``under both Federal and State 
        law, the courts play a crucial and essential role in the 
        Nation's child welfare system and in ensuring safety, 
        stability, and permanence for abused and neglected children 
        under the supervision of that system''.
            (2) Child outcomes are improved and courts function more 
        effectively when all parties have quality legal representation. 
        Analysis of data from programs in New York and Michigan 
        revealed that more than 50 percent of children avoided 
        unnecessary foster care placement when all parties received 
        high quality representation. According to the American Bar 
        Association, a pilot program in the State of Washington to 
        improve representation for parents resulted in ``a 53.3 percent 
        increase in the rate of reunification''.
            (3) In New York, children placed in foster care whose 
        parents receive high quality legal representation spent on 
        average 4.5 months in placement compared to a statewide average 
        of 2\1/2\ years and re-entry rates of 1 percent compared to 15 
        percent statewide.
            (4) According to the American Bar Association, the cost per 
        family for high quality legal services in New York was 
        approximately $6,000 over the life of a case as compared to 
        anywhere from $29,000 to $66,000 for 1 year of foster care for 
        a child in New York City in 2010.
            (5) Training and standards of representation are necessary 
        to ensure qualified representation. According to the American 
        Bar Association Center on Children and the Law, parental 
        representation is ``often substandard, resulting in the failure 
        of due process in these cases. As a result, numerous children 
        are needlessly separated from their parents for extended 
        periods of time and in many cases families are permanently 
        severed through termination of parental rights orders'' and 
        most States have no standard training requirements for 
        attorneys representing parents in their State.
