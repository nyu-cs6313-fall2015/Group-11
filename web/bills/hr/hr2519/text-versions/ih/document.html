  To direct the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human 
 Services, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide assistance 
  for individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) From 1961 to 1971, approximately 19,000,000 gallons of 
        15 different herbicides were sprayed over the southern region 
        of Vietnam. The agents included 13,000,000 gallons of Agent 
        Orange, 4,500,000 gallons of Agent White, 1,000,000 gallons of 
        Agent Blue, 420,000 gallons of Agent Purple, and relatively 
        smaller quantities of the other herbicides. Many of the 
        herbicides, including Agents Orange, Purple, Green, Pink, 
        Dinoxol, and Trinoxol contained the toxic contaminant dioxin 
        (TCDD). One, Agent Blue, contained high levels of arsenic. The 
        aforementioned 15 herbicides, including the contaminant dioxin, 
        are usually collectively referred to as Agent Orange.
            (2) Studies show that between 2,100,000 and 4,800,000 
        Vietnamese and tens of thousands of Americans were exposed to 
        Agent Orange during the spraying. Many other Vietnamese were or 
        continue to be exposed to Agent Orange through contact with the 
        environment and food that was contaminated or as offspring of 
        those exposed who now suffer from illnesses and disabilities.
            (3) Today, there are still dozens of environmental hot 
        spots that continue to contaminate the food, soil, sediment, 
        livestock, and wildlife with Agent Orange.
            (4) Agent Orange exposure continues to negatively affect 
        the lives of men and women in Vietnam and in the United States. 
        The lives of many victims, including Vietnamese, United States 
        veterans and their offspring, and Vietnamese-Americans, are cut 
        short and others live with disease, disabilities, and pain, 
        often untreated or unrecognized.
            (5) The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes certain 
        illnesses and diseases, including AL amyloidosis, chronic B-
        cell leukemia, chloracne, diabetes mellitus type 2, Hodgkin's 
        disease, ischemic heart disease, multiple myeloma, non-
        Hodgkin's lymphoma, Parkinson's disease, acute and sub-acute 
        peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate 
        cancer, respiratory cancers, and soft-tissue sarcomas as 
        associated with the spraying and use of Agent Orange by the 
        United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam era.
            (6) No similar consideration has been given to affected 
        Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans.
            (7) The Department of Veterans Affairs provides 
        compensation for many severe birth defects among the children 
        of American women veterans who served in Vietnam. The list of 
        birth defects covered includes but is not limited to: 
        achondroplasia, cleft lip, cleft palate, congenital heart 
        disease, congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), esophageal 
        and intestinal atresia, Hallerman-Streiff syndrome, hip 
        dysplasia, Hirschsprung's disease (congenital megacolon), 
        hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis, hypospadias, 
        imperforate anus, neural tube defects, Poland syndrome, pyloric 
        stenosis, syndactyly (fused digits), tracheoesophageal fistula, 
        undescended testes, and Williams syndrome. Affected children of 
        these women veterans receive medical care and other benefits.
            (8) The only birth defect recognized for the children of 
        male American veterans is spina bifida (but not occulta), 
        resulting in most affected children receiving no benefits.
            (9) No assistance has been given to the children of male or 
        female Vietnamese or Vietnamese-Americans connected with their 
        exposure, or their parent's or grandparent's exposure.
            (10) The Institute of Medicine for the past several years 
        has noted that ``it is considerably more plausible than 
        previously believed that exposure to the herbicides sprayed in 
        Vietnam might have caused paternally mediated transgenerational 
        effects . . . attributable to the TCCD contaminant in Agent 
        Orange.'' In recent years, scientific studies have identified 
        likely epigenetic links between exposure to toxins and birth 
        defects and developmental disorders in subsequent generations. 
        Some of the children and grandchildren of exposed persons 
        (Americans, Vietnamese, and Vietnamese-Americans) who were in 
        southern Vietnam during the Vietnam era likely suffer from 
        disorders, birth defects, and illnesses related to Agent 
        Orange.
            (11) Dating back to 2007, the United States has engaged in 
        environmental remediation of contamination at the Da Nang and 
        Bien Hoa airports, and provided funds for public health and 
        disabilities activities for individuals residing in some 
        affected areas.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to address and 
remediate the ongoing problems and concerns that arose or will arise 
from the use of the Agent Orange during the Vietnam era.
