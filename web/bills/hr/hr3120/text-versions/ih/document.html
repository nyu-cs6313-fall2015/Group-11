SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States must establish a nationwide and 
        comprehensive approach to address the lack of access to needed 
        dental care and reduce oral health disparities.
            (2) Since 2000, when the Surgeon General of the United 
        States called dental disease a ``silent epidemic'', there has 
        been increasing but still insufficient attention given to 
        addressing oral health issues. The Healthy People 2020 
        initiative includes oral health as a leading health indicator 
        for the first time in the history of the Healthy People 
        program, and in 2011, the Institute of Medicine published 2 
        reports, ``Improving Access to Oral Health Care for Vulnerable 
        and Underserved Populations'' and ``Advancing Oral Health in 
        America'', that focused on oral health.
            (3) Dental caries, commonly known as cavities, are the most 
        common chronic disease for children in the United States. 
        Additionally, 25 percent of American adults who have attained 
        65 years of age have lost all of their teeth.
            (4) Untreated oral health problems contribute to an 
        increased risk for serious medical conditions such as diabetes, 
        hospital-acquired pneumonia, and poor birth outcomes.
            (5) According to a report by the Surgeon General of the 
        United States, students miss more than 51,000,000 hours of 
        school and employed adults lose more than 164,000,000 hours of 
        work each year due to dental disease and dental visits.
            (6) While the lack of access to oral health services is a 
        national problem, those who are most likely to remain 
        underserved are individuals with low incomes, racial and ethnic 
        minorities, pregnant women, older adults, individuals with 
        special needs, and individuals living in rural communities.
            (7) More than 1 in 4 Americans do not have dental health 
        insurance which is far greater than the number of individuals 
        who lack general health insurance.
            (8) The Medicare program and the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs do not provide dental coverage to the majority of their 
        beneficiaries, and States can elect whether to provide dental 
        coverage to adults under the Medicaid program.
            (9) Only 20 percent of practicing dentists in the United 
        States provide care to individuals enrolled in Medicaid, and a 
        very small percentage of dentists devote a substantial part of 
        their practice towards caring for individuals who are 
        underserved.
            (10) The United States spends more than $100,000,000,000 on 
        dental care and that number is expected to rise to 
        $170,000,000,000 by 2020. Over $30,000,000,000 dollars was 
        spent out-of-pocket for dental services in 2008.
            (11) The lack of access to oral health services results in 
        higher health care expenditures. In 2009, there were over 
        830,000 visits to emergency rooms across the United States for 
        preventable dental conditions, which is 16 percent higher than 
        in 2006. The treatment of dental conditions in hospital 
        emergency rooms in 2010 cost as much as $2,100,000,000.
