  To require that spent nuclear fuel be stored in certified dry cask 
                    storage, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Dry Cask Storage Act''.

SEC. 2. DRY CASK SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL STORAGE.

    (a) Required Designation.--The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall 
establish a procedure to require designation of spent nuclear fuel 
contained in storage pools as qualified to be placed in dry cask 
storage when the fuel has cooled sufficiently to permit such storage 
method.
    (b) Fuel Currently in Pools.--As soon as practicable, but not later 
than 15 years after the date of enactment of this Act, all spent 
nuclear fuel that is contained in storage pools as of such date of 
enactment and qualified to be placed in dry cask storage shall be moved 
to dry casks certified by the Commission.
    (c) Disposition.--Except as provided in subsection (b), not later 
than 1 year after fuel is designated by the Commission pursuant to 
subsection (a) as qualified to be placed in dry cask storage--
            (1) such fuel shall be moved from storage pools and placed 
        in certified dry casks; and
            (2) such casks shall, to the extent the Commission 
        considers appropriate after conducting a cost-benefit analysis, 
        be stored temporarily in hardened onsite storage facilities.
    (d) Costs of Compliance.--The Secretary of Energy shall determine 
the costs required for compliance with subsection (b) or (c) by the 
owner of spent nuclear fuel, and shall reduce by that amount the amount 
due from that owner pursuant to section 302 of the Nuclear Waste Policy 
Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10222).
    (e) Annual Status Reports.--The Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall 
require each facility storing spent nuclear fuel to submit to the 
Commission an annual report describing--
            (1) the total amount of spent fuel stored onsite, whether 
        in storage pools, dry casks, hardened onsite storage 
        facilities, or some other storage method;
            (2) how much of the fuel is stored using each method of 
        storage; and
            (3) how much of the fuel has been moved from one storage 
        method or location to another during the past year.
    (f) Regulations.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall issue regulations 
for carrying out this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
