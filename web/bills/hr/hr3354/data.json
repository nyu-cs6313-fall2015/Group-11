Requires such casks, to the extent appropriate after a cost-benefit analysis, to be stored temporarily in hardened onsite storage facilities.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to determine compliance costs for the owner of the spent nuclear fuel, and to reduce by that amount the amount due from the owner to the Nuclear Waste Fund pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982."
