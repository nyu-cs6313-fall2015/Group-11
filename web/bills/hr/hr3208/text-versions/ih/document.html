 To clarify that certain natural gas facilities are not subject to the 
                            Natural Gas Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. NATURAL GAS ACT JURISDICTION.

    Section 1 of the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717) is amended by 
adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(e) A person not otherwise subject to this Act shall not become 
subject to this Act solely by reason of such person's construction or 
operation of a facility not otherwise subject to this Act that 
liquefies, stores, processes, or delivers natural gas for vehicular 
natural gas or other end use purposes notwithstanding that natural gas 
may be reinjected from the facility into an interstate pipeline, 
provided that such reinjections are incidental to the facility's 
provision of natural gas for vehicular or other end use purposes and 
are required by the operational, maintenance, or safety needs of the 
facility.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
