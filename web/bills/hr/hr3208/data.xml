  <summary>9/27/2013--Introduced.
Amends the Natural Gas Act to exclude from its jurisdiction persons who would not otherwise be subject to the Act if the sole reason for inclusion would be the person's construction or operation of a facility not otherwise subject to the Act that liquefies, stores, processes, or delivers natural gas for vehicular natural gas or other end use purposes even though natural gas may be reinjected into an interstate pipeline, as long as such reinjections are incidental to the facility's provision of natural gas for end use purposes and are required by certain facility needs.</summary>
