Directs the Secretary to remove from the program any country: (1) that poses a U.S. national security threat, (2) that exceeds the visa overstay threshold, and (3) whose continued program participation jeopardizes or could jeopardize national security.\n\nRepeals retroactively visa overstay waiver authority."
