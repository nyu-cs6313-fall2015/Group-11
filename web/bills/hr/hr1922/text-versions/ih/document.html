SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Foreign assistance is an important tool utilized to 
        facilitate diplomacy by making investments in infrastructure 
        and basic human needs abroad.
            (2) United States taxpayer dollars should be used prudently 
        and appropriately, and should not be distributed to those who 
        seek to do harm to Americans or our allies.
            (3) Failure to cooperate with the United States as it 
        carries out its foreign policy objectives should necessarily 
        lead to restricted or terminated United States foreign 
        assistance.
            (4) Once foreign assistance to a country is restricted, 
        Congress reserves the right to reinstate any such foreign 
        assistance based on substantive changes in rhetoric or action 
        of that country, and on a case-by-case basis.
            (5) The countries of Iran, North Korea, Syria, Egypt, and 
        Pakistan have engaged in activities that undermine the security 
        and foreign policy objectives of the United States or 
        compromise regional and international stability.
