                                 A BILL


 
    To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to allow retail 
 community pharmacies to deliver diabetic testing supplies to Medicare 
                             beneficiaries.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Diabetic Testing Supply Access Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. AUTHORITY FOR RETAIL COMMUNITY PHARMACIES TO DELIVER DIABETIC 
              TESTING SUPPLIES TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.

    (a) In General.--Section 1847(a) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395w-3(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph:
            ``(8) Nothing in this section shall be construed as 
        authorizing the Secretary (through regulation, guidance, 
        instruction, or otherwise) to restrict or eliminate an 
        individual's option of electing, regardless of delivery method 
        (except by mail), to have diabetic testing supplies delivered 
        to the individual by a retail community pharmacy (as defined in 
        section 1927(k)(10)), including a retail community pharmacy 
        that contracts with a long-term care facility, assisted living 
        facility, group home, or other type of residential setting 
        recognized by the State. This paragraph shall not be construed 
        as changing the amount of payment made under this part for 
        diabetic testing supplies, but only as authorizing delivery of 
        such supplies to individuals through retail community 
        pharmacies.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply to diabetic testing supplies delivered on or after the date of 
the enactment of this Act.
                                 <all>
