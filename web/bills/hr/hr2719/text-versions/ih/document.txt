                                 A BILL


 
To require the Transportation Security Administration to implement best 
     practices and improve transparency with regard to technology 
             acquisition programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation Security Acquisition 
Reform Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Transportation Security Administration (in this Act 
        referred to as ``TSA'') does not consistently implement 
        Department of Homeland Security policies and Government best 
        practices for acquisition and procurement.
            (2) TSA has not developed a multiyear technology 
        acquisition plan. As a result, TSA has underutilized innovation 
        opportunities within the private sector, including from small 
        businesses.
            (3) Due in part to the deficiencies referred to in 
        paragraphs (1) and (2), TSA has faced challenges in meeting key 
        performance requirements for several major acquisitions and 
        procurements, resulting in reduced security effectiveness and 
        wasted expenditures.

SEC. 3. TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION ACQUISITION REFORM.

    (a) In General.--Title XVI of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 
(116 Stat. 2312) is amended to read as follows:

Administrator shall conduct a comprehensive analysis to determine 
whether the acquisition is justified. The analysis shall include, but 
may not be limited to, the following:
            ``(1) An identification of the type and level of risk to 
        transportation security that would be addressed with the

        to the multiyear plan developed under section 1611.
            ``(3) A comparison of the total expected lifecycle cost 
        against the total expected quantitative and qualitative 
        benefits to transportation security.

        determine if the proposed technology acquisition is the most 
        effective and cost-efficient solution based on cost-benefit 
        considerations.

        expected benefit to transportation security is consistent with 
        fair information practice principles issued by the Privacy

        Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the 
        Senate the results of the comprehensive acquisition analysis 
        required under this section and a certification by the 
        Administrator that the security benefits justify the contract 
        cost.
            ``(2) Extension due to imminent terrorist threat.--If there

        consultation with the Under Secretary for Science and 
        Technology, shall develop a plan for testing and evaluating the
