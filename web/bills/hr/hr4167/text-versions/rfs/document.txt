 To amend section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, known as 
the Volcker Rule, to exclude certain debt securities of collateralized

              OBLIGATIONS.

    Section 13(g) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 
1851(g)) is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
            ``(4) Collateralized loan obligations.--
                    ``(A) Inapplicability to certain collateralized 
                loan obligations.--Nothing in this section shall be 
                construed to require the divestiture, prior to July 21, 
                2017, of any debt securities of collateralized loan 
                obligations, if such debt securities were issued before 
                January 31, 2014.
                    ``(B) Ownership interest with respect to 
                collateralized loan obligations.--A banking entity 
                shall not be considered to have an ownership interest 
                in a collateralized loan obligation because it 
                acquires, has acquired, or retains a debt security in 
                such collateralized loan obligation if the debt 
                security has no indicia of ownership other than the 
                right of the banking entity to participate in the 
                removal for cause, or in the selection of a replacement 
                after removal for cause or resignation, of an 
                investment manager or investment adviser of the 
                collateralized loan obligation.
                    ``(C) Definitions.--For purposes of this paragraph:
                            ``(i) Collateralized loan obligation.--The 
                        term `collateralized loan obligation' means any 
                        issuing entity of an asset-backed security, as 
                        defined in section 3(a)(77) of the Securities 
                        Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(77)), 
                        that is comprised primarily of commercial 
                        loans.
                            ``(ii) Removal for cause.--An investment 
                        manager or investment adviser shall be deemed 
                        to be removed `for cause' if the investment 
                        manager or investment adviser is removed as a 
                        result of--

                                materially adverse effect on the 
                                collateralized loan obligation, if the

                                reasonable steps to cure such effect
