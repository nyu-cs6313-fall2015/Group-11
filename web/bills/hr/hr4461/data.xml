  <summary>4/10/2014--Introduced.
Climate Change Education Act - Declares that the evidence for human-induced climate change is overwhelming and undeniable.

Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to establish a Climate Change Education Program to:

 broaden the understanding of human-induced climate change, possible consequences, and potential solutions; apply the latest scientific and technological discoveries to provide learning opportunities to people of all ages; conduct a national information campaign to help people understand and promote implementation of new technologies, programs, and incentives related to energy conservation, renewable energy, and greenhouse gas reduction; and inform the public of impacts to human health and safety as a result of climate change. Directs NOAA to establish a grant program to support climate change education.</summary>
