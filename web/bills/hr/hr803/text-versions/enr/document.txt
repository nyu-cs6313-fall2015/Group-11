            schools.
        (2) Initial designation.--During the first 2 full program years

    Workforce Investment Act of 1998 for the 2-year period preceding 
    the date of enactment of this Act, performed successfully, and 
    sustained fiscal integrity.
        (3) Subsequent designation.--After the period for which a local 
    area is initially designated under paragraph (2), the Governor

        (4) Designation on recommendation of state board.--The Governor 
    may approve a request from any unit of general local government

    not granted designation of an area as a local area under paragraph 
    (2) or (3) may submit an appeal to the State board under an appeal 
    process established in the State plan. If the appeal does not 
    result in such a designation, the Secretary of Labor, after

    on determining that the unit or grant recipient was not accorded 
    procedural rights under the appeals process described in the State 
    plan, as specified in section 102(b)(2)(D)(i)(III), or that the

        section 116(c), for local areas or the planning region.

    described in paragraph (1) and that incorporates local plans for 
    each of the local areas in the planning region. The State shall 
    provide technical assistance and labor market data, as requested by 
    local areas, to assist with such regional planning and subsequent 
    service delivery efforts.

        accompanying provision specifically for a planning region, the 
        term ``local area'' in a provision includes a reference to a 
        planning region for purposes of implementation of that 
        provision by the corresponding local areas in the region.

    of this title. In the case of such designation, the Governor shall 
    identify the State as a local area in the State plan.
        (2) Effect on local plan and local functions.--In any case in 
    which a State is designated as a local area pursuant to this 
    subsection, the local plan prepared under section 108 for the area 
    shall be submitted for approval as part of the State plan. In such 
    a State, the State board shall carry out the functions of a local

    indicators of performance described in section 116(b)(2)(A) (or, if 
    applicable, core indicators of performance described in section

    last 2 consecutive years preceding the determination regarding such 
    integrity, that either the grant recipient or the administrative 
    entity of the area misexpended funds provided under subtitle B (or, 
    if applicable, title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 as 
    in effect prior to the effective date of such subtitle B) due to 
    willful disregard of the requirements of the provision involved, 
    gross negligence, or failure to comply with accepted standards of 
    administration.

        Labor or the Secretary of Education, as appropriate) a State 
        fails to submit a report under subsection (d) for any program 
        year, the percentage of each amount that would (in the absence 
        of this paragraph) be reserved by the Governor under section 
        128(a) for the immediately succeeding program year shall be 
        reduced by 5 percentage points until such date as the Secretary 
        of Labor or the Secretary of Education, as appropriate,

    centers. Such criteria and procedures shall--
            (A) be developed in a manner that is consistent with the 
        guidelines, guidance, and policies provided by the Governor and 
        by the State board, in consultation with the chief elected

        under subsections (h)(1) and (i); and
            (B) include such factors relating to the effectiveness, 
        accessibility, and improvement of the one-stop delivery system 
        as the State board determines to be appropriate, including at a 
        minimum how well the one-stop center--
                (i) supports the achievement of the negotiated local 
            levels of performance for the indicators of performance 
            described in section 116(b)(2) for the local area;
                (ii) integrates available services; and
                (iii) meets the workforce development and employment 
            needs of local employers and participants.
        (3) Local criteria.--Consistent with the criteria developed 
    under paragraph (1) by the State, a local board in the State may 
    develop additional criteria (or higher levels of service 
    coordination than required for the State-developed criteria) 
    relating to service coordination achieved by the one-stop delivery 
    system, for purposes of assessments described in paragraph (1), in 
    order to respond to labor market, economic, and demographic, 
    conditions and trends in the local area.
        (4) Effect of certification.--One-stop centers certified under 
    this subsection shall be eligible to receive the infrastructure 
    funding described in subsection (h).
        (5) Review and update.--The criteria and procedures established 
    under this subsection shall be reviewed and updated by the State 
    board or the local board, as the case may be, as part of the 
    biennial process for review and modification of State and local 
    plans described in sections 102(c)(2) and 108(a).

            (b)(1) in a local area may fund the costs of infrastructure 
            of one-stop centers in the local area through--

                    (I) methods agreed on by the local board, chief 
                elected officials, and one-stop partners (and described 
                in the memorandum of understanding described in 
                subsection (c)); or
                    (II) if no consensus agreement on methods is 
                reached under subclause (I), the State infrastructure 
                funding mechanism described in paragraph (2).

                (ii) Failure to reach consensus agreement on funding 
            methods.--Beginning July 1, 2016, if the local board, chief 
            elected officials, and one-stop partners described in 
            subsection (b)(1) in a local area fail to reach consensus 
            agreement on methods of sufficiently funding the costs of 
            infrastructure of one-stop centers for a program year, the 
            State infrastructure funding mechanism described in 
            paragraph (2) shall be applicable to such local area for 
            that program year and for each subsequent program year for 
            which those entities and individuals fail to reach such 
            agreement.
            (B) Guidance for infrastructure funding.--In addition to 
        carrying out the requirements relating to the State 
        infrastructure funding mechanism described in paragraph (2), 
        the Governor, after consultation with chief elected officials, 
        local boards, and the State board, and consistent with the 
        guidance and policies provided by the State board under 
        subparagraphs (B) and (C)(i) of section 101(d)(7), shall 
        provide, for the use of local areas under subparagraph 
        (A)(i)(I)--
                (i) guidelines for State-administered one-stop partner 
            programs, for determining such programs' contributions to a 
            one-stop delivery system, based on such programs' 
            proportionate use of such system consistent with chapter II 
            of title 2, Code of Federal Regulations (or any 
            corresponding similar regulation or ruling), including 
            determining funding for the costs of infrastructure, which 
            contributions shall be negotiated pursuant to the 
            memorandum of understanding under subsection (c); and
                (ii) guidance to assist local boards, chief elected 
            officials, and one-stop partners in local areas in 
            determining equitable and stable methods of funding the 
            costs of infrastructure of one-stop centers in such areas.
        (2) State one-stop infrastructure funding.--
            (A) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term ``covered 
        portion'', used with respect to funding for a fiscal year for a 
        program described in subsection (b)(1), means a portion 
        determined under subparagraph (C) of the Federal funds provided 
        to a State (including local areas within the State) under the 
        Federal law authorizing that program described in subsection 
        (b)(1) for the fiscal year (taking into account the 
        availability of funding for purposes related to infrastructure 
        from philanthropic organizations, private entities, or other 
        alternative financing options).
            (B) Partner contributions.--Subject to subparagraph (D), 
        for local areas in a State that are not covered by paragraph 
        (1)(A)(i)(I), the covered portions of funding for a fiscal year 
        shall be provided to the Governor from the programs described 
        in subsection (b)(1), to assist in paying the costs of 
        infrastructure of one-stop centers in those local areas of the 
        State not adequately funded under the option described in 
        paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I).
            (C) Determination of governor.--
                (i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii) and 
            subparagraph (D), the Governor, after consultation with 
            chief elected officials, local boards, and the State board, 
            shall determine the portion of funds to be provided under 
            subparagraph (B) by each one-stop partner from each program 
            described in subparagraph (B). In making such determination 
            for the purpose of determining funding contributions, for 
            funding pursuant to clause (i)(II) or (ii) of paragraph 
            (1)(A) by each partner, the Governor shall calculate 
            amounts for the proportionate use of the one-stop centers 
            in the State, consistent with chapter II of title 2, Code 
            of Federal Regulations (or any corresponding similar 
            regulation or ruling), taking into account the costs of 
            administration of the one-stop delivery system for purposes 
            not related to one-stop centers, for each partner. The 
            Governor shall exclude from such determination of funds the 
            amounts for proportionate use of one-stop centers 
            attributable to the programs of one-stop partners for those 
            local areas of the State where the costs of infrastructure 
            of one-stop centers are funded under the option described 
            in paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I). The Governor shall also take 
            into account the statutory requirements for each partner 
            program and the partner program's ability to fulfill such 
            requirements.
                (ii) Special rule.--In a State in which the State 
            constitution or a State statute places policymaking 
            authority that is independent of the authority of the 
            Governor in an entity or official with respect to the funds 
            provided for adult education and literacy activities 
            authorized under title II, postsecondary career and 
            technical education activities authorized under the Carl D. 
            Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 (20 
            U.S.C. 2301 et seq.), or vocational rehabilitation services 
            offered under a provision covered by section 3(13)(D), the 
            determination described in clause (i) with respect to the 
            programs authorized under that title, Act, or provision 
            shall be made by the chief officer of the entity, or the 
            official, with such authority in consultation with the 
            Governor.
            (D) Limitations.--
                (i) Provision from administrative funds.--

                    (I) In general.--Subject to subclause (II), the 
                funds provided under this paragraph by each one-stop 
                partner shall be provided only from funds available for 
                the costs of administration under the program 
                administered by such partner, and shall be subject to 
                the program's limitations with respect to the portion 
                of funds under such program that may be used for 
                administration.
                    (II) Exceptions.--Nothing in this clause shall be 
                construed to apply to the programs carried out under 
                this title, or under title V of the Older Americans Act 
                of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3056 et seq.).

                (ii) Cap on required contributions.--For local areas in 
            a State that are not covered by paragraph (1)(A)(i)(I), the 
            following rules shall apply:

                    (I) Wia formula programs and employment service.--
                The portion of funds required to be contributed under 
                this paragraph from a program authorized under chapter 
                2 or 3, or the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.) 
                shall not exceed 3 percent of the amount of Federal 
                funds provided to carry out that program in the State 
                for a fiscal year.
                    (II) Other one-stop partners.--The portion of funds 
                required to be contributed under this paragraph from a 
                program described in subsection (b)(1) other than the 
                programs described in subclause (I) shall not exceed 
                1.5 percent of the amount of Federal funds provided to 
                carry out that program in the State for a fiscal year.
                    (III) Vocational rehabilitation.--Notwithstanding 
                subclauses (I) and (II), an entity administering a 
                program described in subsection (b)(1)(B)(iv) shall not 
                be required to provide from that program, under this 
                paragraph, a portion that exceeds--

                        (aa) 0.75 percent of the amount of Federal 
                    funds provided to carry out such program in the 
                    State for the second full program year that begins 
                    after the date of enactment of this Act;
                        (bb) 1.0 percent of the amount provided to 
                    carry out such program in the State for the third 
                    full program year that begins after such date;
                        (cc) 1.25 percent of the amount provided to 
                    carry out such program in the State for the fourth 
                    full program year that begins after such date; and
                        (dd) 1.5 percent of the amount provided to 
                    carry out such program in the State for the fifth 
                    and each succeeding full program year that begins 
                    after such date.
                (iii) Federal direct spending programs.--For local 
            areas in a State that are not covered by paragraph 
            (1)(A)(i)(I), an entity administering a program funded with 
            direct spending as defined in section 250(c)(8) of the 
            Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, 
            as in effect on February 15, 2014 (2 U.S.C. 900(c)(8)) 
            shall not be required to provide, for purposes of this 
            paragraph, an amount in excess of the amount determined 
            under subparagraph (C)(i) to be equivalent to the cost of 
            the proportionate use of the one-stop centers for the one-
            stop partner for such program in the State.
                (iv) Native american programs.--One-stop partners for 
            Native American programs established under section 166 
            shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection 
            (other than this clause) or subsection (i). For purposes of 
            subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii)(II), the method for determining 
            the appropriate portion of funds to be provided by such 
            partners to pay for the costs of infrastructure of a one-
            stop center shall be determined as part of the development 
            of the memorandum of understanding under subsection (c) for 
            the one-stop center and shall be stated in the memorandum.
            (E) Appeal by one-stop partners.--The Governor shall 
        establish a process, described under section 
        102(b)(2)(D)(i)(IV), for a one-stop partner administering a 
        program described in subsection (b)(1) to appeal a 
        determination regarding the portion of funds to be provided 
        under this paragraph. Such a determination may be appealed 
        under the process on the basis that such determination is 
        inconsistent with the requirements of this paragraph. Such 
        process shall ensure prompt resolution of the appeal in order 
        to ensure the funds are distributed in a timely manner, 
        consistent with the requirements of section 182(e).
        (3) Allocation by governor.--
            (A) In general.--From the funds provided under paragraph 
        (1), the Governor shall allocate the funds to local areas 
        described in subparagraph (B) in accordance with the formula 
        established under subparagraph (B) for the purposes of 
        assisting in paying the costs of infrastructure of one-stop 
        centers.
            (B) Allocation formula.--The State board shall develop a 
        formula to be used by the Governor to allocate the funds 
        provided under paragraph (1) to local areas not funding costs 
        of infrastructure under the option described in paragraph 
        (1)(A)(i)(I). The formula shall be based on factors including 
        the number of one-stop centers in a local area, the population 
        served by such centers, the services provided by such centers, 
        and other factors relating to the performance of such centers 
        that the State board determines are appropriate.
        (4) Costs of infrastructure.--In this subsection, the term 
    ``costs of infrastructure'', used with respect to a one-stop 
    center, means the nonpersonnel costs that are necessary for the 
    general operation of the one-stop center, including the rental 
    costs of the facilities, the costs of utilities and maintenance, 
    equipment (including assessment-related products and assistive 
    technology for individuals with disabilities), and technology to 
    facilitate access to the one-stop center, including the center's 
    planning and outreach activities.
    (i) Other Funds.--
        (1) In general.--Subject to the memorandum of understanding 
    described in subsection (c) for the one-stop delivery system 
    involved, in addition to the funds provided to carry out subsection 
    (h), a portion of funds made available under Federal law 
    authorizing the programs described in subsection (b) and 
    administered by one-stop partners, or the noncash resources 
    available under such programs, shall be used to pay the additional 
    costs relating to the operation of the one-stop delivery system 
    that are not paid from the funds provided under subsection (h), as 
    determined in accordance with paragraph (3), to the extent not 
    inconsistent with the Federal law involved. Such costs shall 
    include the costs of the provision of career services described in 
    section 134(c)(2) applicable to each program and may include common 
    costs that are not paid from the funds provided under subsection 
    (h).
        (2) Shared services.--The costs described under paragraph (1) 
    may include costs of services that are authorized for and may be 
    commonly provided through the one-stop partner programs to any 
    individual, such as initial intake, assessment of needs, appraisal 
    of basic skills, identification of appropriate services to meet 
    such needs, referrals to other one-stop partners, and other similar 
    services.
        (3) Determination and guidance.--The method for determining the 
    appropriate portion of funds and noncash resources to be provided 
    by the one-stop partner for each program under paragraph (1) for a 
    one-stop center shall be determined as part of the development of 
    the memorandum of understanding under subsection (c) for the one-
    stop center and shall be stated in the memorandum. The State board 
    shall provide guidance to facilitate the determination, for 
    purposes of the memorandum of understanding, of an appropriate 
    allocation of the funds and noncash resources in local areas, 
    consistent with the requirements of section 101(d)(6)(C).

            determined by the Governor for those participants receiving 
            training services under this subtitle (taking into 
            consideration the characteristics of the population served 
            and relevant economic conditions), and the outcomes of the 
            program through which those training services were provided

        practicable, the providers to use industry-recognized 
        certificates or certifications.
            (G) The ability of the providers to offer programs that 
        lead to recognized postsecondary credentials.
            (H) The quality of a program of training services, 
        including a program of training services that leads to a 
        recognized postsecondary credential.
            (I) The ability of the providers to provide training 
        services to individuals who are employed and individuals with 
        barriers to employment.
            (J) Such other factors as the Governor determines are 
        appropriate to ensure--
                (i) the accountability of the providers;

    requirements established by the Governor shall require that a 
    provider of training services submit appropriate, accurate, and 
    timely information to the State, to enable the State to carry out

            (E) information on the criteria described in paragraph (1).
        (3) Local criteria and information requirements.--A local board 
    in the State may establish criteria and information requirements in 
    addition to the criteria and information requirements established 
    by the Governor, or may require higher levels of performance than 
    required for the criteria established by the Governor, for purposes 
    of determining the eligibility of providers of training services to 
    receive funds described in subsection (a) for the provision of 
    training services in the local area involved.
        (4) Criteria and information requirements to establish initial 
    eligibility.--

        eligibility under this paragraph as providers of training 
        services and may receive that initial eligibility for only 1 
        fiscal year for a particular program. The criteria and 
        information requirements established by the Governor under this 
        paragraph shall require that a provider who has not previously 
        been an eligible provider of training services under this 
        section (or section 122 of the Workforce Investment Act of 
        1998, as in effect on the day before the date of enactment of 
        this Act) provide the information described in subparagraph 
        (C).
            (C) Information.--The provider shall provide verifiable 
        program-specific performance information based on criteria

        this subtitle.
            (D) Criteria.--The criteria described in subparagraph (C) 
        shall include at least--

                (ii) a factor concerning whether the provider is in a 
            partnership with business;
                (iii) other factors that indicate high-quality training 
            services, including the factor described in paragraph 
            (1)(H); and
                (iv) a factor concerning alignment of the training 
            services with in-demand industry sectors and occupations, 
            to the extent practicable.

                    (II) Small state minimum allotment.--Subject to 
                subclauses (I), (III), and (IV), the Secretary shall

                    the remainder described in clause (i) for the 
                    fiscal year; and
                        (bb) if the remainder described in clause (i) 
                    for the fiscal year exceeds $1,000,000,000, \2/5\ 
                    of 1 percent of the excess.

                    (III) Maximum percentage.--Subject to subclause 
                (I), the Secretary shall ensure that no State shall 
                receive an allotment percentage for a fiscal year that

        described in paragraph (1)(C)(i) that is received through an 
        allotment made under paragraph (1)(C) for the fiscal year. The 
        term, used with respect to fiscal year 2014, means the 
        percentage of the amount allotted to States under section 
        127(b)(1)(C) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (as in 
        effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act) 
        that is received under such section by the State involved for 
        fiscal year 2014.
            (B) Area of substantial unemployment.--The term ``area of 
        substantial unemployment'' means any area that is of sufficient 
        size and scope to sustain a program of workforce investment 
        activities carried out under this subtitle and that has an 
        average rate of unemployment of at least 6.5 percent for the 
        most recent 12 months, as determined by the Secretary. For 
        purposes of this subparagraph, determinations of areas of 
        substantial unemployment shall be made once each fiscal year.
            (C) Disadvantaged youth.--Subject to paragraph (3), the 
        term ``disadvantaged youth'' means an individual who is age 16 
        through 21 who received an income, or is a member of a family 
        that received a total family income, that, in relation to 
        family size, does not exceed the higher of--
                (i) the poverty line; or
                (ii) 70 percent of the lower living standard income 
            level.
            (D) Excess number.--The term ``excess number'' means, used 
        with respect to the excess number of unemployed individuals 
        within a State, the higher of--
                (i) the number that represents the number of unemployed 
            individuals in excess of 4.5 percent of the civilian labor 
            force in the State; or
                (ii) the number that represents the number of 
            unemployed individuals in excess of 4.5 percent of the 
            civilian labor force in areas of substantial unemployment 
            in such State.
            (E) Low-income level.--The term ``low-income level'' means 
        $7,000 with respect to income in 1969, and for any later year 
        means that amount that bears the same relationship to $7,000 as 
        the Consumer Price Index for that year bears to the Consumer 
        Price Index for 1969, rounded to the nearest $1,000.
        (3) Special rule.--For the purpose of the formula specified in 
    paragraph (1)(C), the Secretary shall, as appropriate and to the 
    extent practicable, exclude college students and members of the 
    Armed Forces from the determination of the number of disadvantaged 
    youth.
    (c) Reallotment.--
        (1) In general.--The Secretary shall, in accordance with this 
    subsection, reallot to eligible States amounts that are made 
    available to States from allotments made under this section or a 
    corresponding provision of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 for 
    youth workforce investment activities and statewide workforce 
    investment activities (referred to individually in this subsection 
    as a ``State allotment'') and that are available for reallotment.
        (2) Amount.--The amount available for reallotment for a program 
    year is equal to the amount by which the unobligated balance of the 
    State allotment, at the end of the program year prior to the 
    program year for which the determination under this paragraph is 
    made, exceeds 20 percent of such allotment for the prior program 
    year.
        (3) Reallotment.--In making reallotments to eligible States of 
    amounts available pursuant to paragraph (2) for a program year, the 
    Secretary shall allot to each eligible State an amount based on the 
    relative amount of the State allotment for the program year for 
    which the determination is made, as compared to the total amount of 
    the State allotments for all eligible States for such program year.
        (4) Eligibility.--For purposes of this subsection, an eligible 
    State means a State that does not have an amount available for 
    reallotment under paragraph (2) for the program year for which the 
    determination under paragraph (2) is made.
        (5) Procedures.--The Governor shall prescribe uniform 
    procedures for the obligation of funds by local areas within the 
    State in order to avoid the requirement that funds be made 
    available for reallotment under this subsection. The Governor shall 
    further prescribe equitable procedures for making funds available 
    from the State and local areas in the event that a State is 
    required to make funds available for reallotment under this 
    subsection.

            private nonprofit service providers, approved by the local 
            board.
        (3) Training services.--
            (A) In general.--
                (i) Eligibility.--Except as provided in clause (ii), 
            funds allocated to a local area for adults under paragraph 
            (2)(A) or (3), as appropriate, of section 133(b), and funds 
            allocated to the local area for dislocated workers under 
            section 133(b)(2)(B), shall be used to provide training 
            services to adults and dislocated workers, respectively--

                    (I) who, after an interview, evaluation, or 
                assessment, and career planning, have been determined 
                by a one-stop operator or one-stop partner, as 
                appropriate, to--

                        (aa) be unlikely or unable to obtain or retain 
                    employment, that leads to economic self-sufficiency 
                    or wages comparable to or higher than wages from 
                    previous employment, through the career services 
                    described in paragraph (2)(A)(xii);
                        (bb) be in need of training services to obtain 
                    or retain employment that leads to economic self-
                    sufficiency or wages comparable to or higher than 
                    wages from previous employment; and
                        (cc) have the skills and qualifications to 
                    successfully participate in the selected program of 
                    training services;

                    (II) who select programs of training services that 
                are directly linked to the employment opportunities in 
                the local area or the planning region, or in another 
                area to which the adults or dislocated workers are 
                willing to commute or relocate;
                    (III) who meet the requirements of subparagraph 
                (B); and
                    (IV) who are determined to be eligible in 
                accordance with the priority system in effect under 
                subparagraph (E).

                (ii) Use of previous assessments.--A one-stop operator 
            or one-stop partner shall not be required to conduct a new 
            interview, evaluation, or assessment of a participant under 
            clause (i) if the one-stop operator or one-stop partner 
            determines that it is appropriate to use a recent 
            interview, evaluation, or assessment of the participant 
            conducted pursuant to another education or training 
            program.
                (iii) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
            subparagraph shall be construed to mean an individual is 
            required to receive career services prior to receiving 
            training services.
            (B) Qualification.--
                (i) Requirement.--Notwithstanding section 479B of the 
            Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087uu) and except 
            as provided in clause (ii), provision of such training 
            services shall be limited to individuals who--

                    (I) are unable to obtain other grant assistance for 
                such services, including Federal Pell Grants 
                established under subpart 1 of part A of title IV of 
                the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a et 
                seq.); or
                    (II) require assistance beyond the assistance made 
                available under other grant assistance programs, 
                including Federal Pell Grants.

                (ii) Reimbursements.--Training services may be provided 
            under this paragraph to an individual who otherwise meets 
            the requirements of this paragraph while an application for 
            a Federal Pell Grant is pending, except that if such 
            individual is subsequently awarded a Federal Pell Grant, 
            appropriate reimbursement shall be made to the local area 
            from such Federal Pell Grant.
                (iii) Consideration.--In determining whether an 
            individual requires assistance under clause (i)(II), a one-
            stop operator (or one-stop partner, where appropriate) may 
            take into consideration the full cost of participating in 
            training services, including the costs of dependent care 
            and transportation, and other appropriate costs.
            (C) Provider qualification.--Training services shall be 
        provided through providers identified in accordance with 
        section 122.
            (D) Training services.--Training services may include--

                (iii) incumbent worker training in accordance with 
            subsection (d)(4);
                (iv) programs that combine workplace training with 
            related instruction, which may include cooperative 
            education programs;
                (v) training programs operated by the private sector;
                (vi) skill upgrading and retraining;

            with services described in any of clauses (i) through 
            (viii);
                (x) adult education and literacy activities, including 
            activities of English language acquisition and integrated 
            education and training programs, provided concurrently or 
            in combination with services described in any of clauses 
            (i) through (vii); and
                (xi) customized training conducted with a commitment by 
            an employer or group of employers to employ an individual 
            upon successful completion of the training.
            (E) Priority.--With respect to funds allocated to a local 
        area for adult employment and training activities under 
        paragraph (2)(A) or (3) of section 133(b), priority shall be 
        given to recipients of public assistance, other low-income 
        individuals, and individuals who are basic skills deficient for 
        receipt of career services described in paragraph (2)(A)(xii) 
        and training services. The appropriate local board and the 
        Governor shall direct the one-stop operators in the local area 
        with regard to making determinations related to such priority.
            (F) Consumer choice requirements.--
                (i) In general.--Training services provided under this 
            paragraph shall be provided in a manner that maximizes 
            consumer choice in the selection of an eligible provider of 
            such services.
                (ii) Eligible providers.--Each local board, through 
            one-stop centers, shall make available the list of eligible 
            providers of training services described in section 122(d), 
            and accompanying information, in accordance with section 
            122(d).
                (iii) Individual training accounts.--An individual who 
            seeks training services and who is eligible pursuant to 
            subparagraph (A), may, in consultation with a career 
            planner, select an eligible provider of training services 
            from the list of providers described in clause (ii). Upon 
            such selection, the one-stop operator involved shall, to 
            the extent practicable, refer such individual to the 
            eligible provider of training services, and arrange for 
            payment for such services through an individual training 
            account.
                (iv) Coordination.--Each local board may, through one-
            stop centers, coordinate funding for individual training 
            accounts with funding from other Federal, State, local, or 
            private job training programs or sources to assist the 
            individual in obtaining training services.
                (v) Additional information.--Priority consideration 
            shall, consistent with clause (i), be given to programs 
            that lead to recognized postsecondary credentials that are 
            aligned with in-demand industry sectors or occupations in 
            the local area involved.
            (G) Use of individual training accounts.--
                (i) In general.--Except as provided in clause (ii), 
            training services provided under this paragraph shall be 
            provided through the use of individual training accounts in 
            accordance with this paragraph, and shall be provided to 
            eligible individuals through the one-stop delivery system.
                (ii) Training contracts.--Training services authorized 
            under this paragraph may be provided pursuant to a contract 
            for services in lieu of an individual training account if--

                    (I) the requirements of subparagraph (F) are met;
                    (II) such services are on-the-job training, 
                customized training, incumbent worker training, or 
                transitional employment;
                    (III) the local board determines there are an 
                insufficient number of eligible providers of training 
                services in the local area involved (such as in a rural 
                area) to accomplish the purposes of a system of 
                individual training accounts;
                    (IV) the local board determines that there is a 
                training services program of demonstrated effectiveness 
                offered in the local area by a community-based 
                organization or another private organization to serve 
                individuals with barriers to employment;
                    (V) the local board determines that--

                        (aa) it would be most appropriate to award a 
                    contract to an institution of higher education or 
                    other eligible provider of training services in 
                    order to facilitate the training of multiple 
                    individuals in in-demand industry sectors or 
                    occupations; and
                        (bb) such contract does not limit customer 
                    choice; or

                    (VI) the contract is a pay-for-performance 
                contract.

                (iii) Linkage to occupations in demand.--Training 
            services provided under this paragraph shall be directly 
            linked to an in-demand industry sector or occupation in the 
            local area or the planning region, or in another area to 
            which an adult or dislocated worker receiving such services 
            is willing to relocate, except that a local board may 
            approve training services for occupations determined by the 
            local board to be in sectors of the economy that have a 
            high potential for sustained demand or growth in the local 
            area.
                (iv) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph 
            shall be construed to preclude the combined use of 
            individual training accounts and contracts in the provision 
            of training services, including arrangements that allow 
            individuals receiving individual training accounts to 
            obtain training services that are contracted for under 
            clause (ii).
            (H) Reimbursement for on-the-job training.--
                (i) Reimbursement level.--For purposes of the provision 
            of on-the-job training under this paragraph, the Governor 
            or local board involved may increase the amount of the 
            reimbursement described in section 3(44) to an amount of up 
            to 75 percent of the wage rate of a participant for a 
            program carried out under chapter 2 or this chapter, if, 
            respectively--

                    (I) the Governor approves the increase with respect 
                to a program carried out with funds reserved by the 
                State under that chapter, taking into account the 
                factors described in clause (ii); or
                    (II) the local board approves the increase with 
                respect to a program carried out with funds allocated 
                to a local area under such chapter, taking into account 
                those factors.

                (ii) Factors.--For purposes of clause (i), the Governor 
            or local board, respectively, shall take into account 
            factors consisting of--

                    (I) the characteristics of the participants;
                    (II) the size of the employer;
                    (III) the quality of employer-provided training and 
                advancement opportunities; and
                    (IV) such other factors as the Governor or local 
                board, respectively, may determine to be appropriate, 
                which may include the number of employees participating 
                in the training, wage and benefit levels of those 
                employees (at present and anticipated upon completion 
                of the training), and relation of the training to the 
                competitiveness of a participant.

        (1) In general.--
            (A) Activities.--Funds allocated to a local area for adults

        (2) Individuals on probation, parole, or supervised release.--
    An individual on probation, parole, or supervised release may be 
    selected as an enrollee only if release from the supervision of the 
    probation or parole official involved is satisfactory to the 
    official and the Secretary and does not violate applicable laws 
    (including regulations). No individual shall be denied a position 
    in the Job Corps solely on the basis of individual contact with the 
    criminal justice system except for a disqualifying conviction as

        (3) Individuals convicted of certain crimes.--An individual 
    shall not be selected as an enrollee if the individual has been

    involving rape or sexual assault.
    (c) Assignment Plan.--
        (1) In general.--Every 2 years, the Secretary shall develop and 
    implement a plan for assigning enrollees to Job Corps centers. In 
    developing the plan, the Secretary shall, based on the analysis 
    described in paragraph (2), establish targets, applicable to each 
    Job Corps center, for--
            (A) the maximum attainable percentage of enrollees at the 
        Job Corps center that reside in the State in which the center 
        is located; and
            (B) the maximum attainable percentage of enrollees at the 
        Job Corps center that reside in the region in which the center 
        is located, and in surrounding regions.
        (2) Analysis.--In order to develop the plan described in 
    paragraph (1), every 2 years the Secretary, in consultation with 
    operators of Job Corps centers, shall analyze relevant factors 
    relating to each Job Corps center, including--
            (A) the size of the population of individuals eligible to 
        participate in Job Corps in the State and region in which the 
        Job Corps center is located, and in surrounding regions;
            (B) the relative demand for participation in the Job Corps 
        in the State and region, and in surrounding regions;
            (C) the capacity and utilization of the Job Corps center, 
        including the education, training, and supportive services 
        provided through the center; and
            (D) the performance of the Job Corps center relating to the 
        expected levels of performance for the indicators described in 
        section 159(c)(1), and whether any actions have been taken with 
        respect to such center pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of 
        section 159(f).
    (d) Assignment of Individual Enrollees.--
        (1) In general.--After an individual has been selected for the 
    Job Corps in accordance with the standards and procedures of the 
    Secretary under subsection (a), the enrollee shall be assigned to 
    the Job Corps center that offers the type of career and technical 
    education and training selected by the individual and, among the 
    centers that offer such education and training, is closest to the 
    home of the individual. The Secretary may waive this requirement 
    if--
            (A) the enrollee would be unduly delayed in participating 
        in the Job Corps program because the closest center is 
        operating at full capacity; or
            (B) the parent or guardian of the enrollee requests 
        assignment of the enrollee to another Job Corps center due to 
        circumstances in the community of the enrollee that would 
        impair prospects for successful participation in the Job Corps 
        program.
        (2) Enrollees who are younger than 18.--An enrollee who is 
    younger than 18 shall not be assigned to a Job Corps center other 
    than the center closest to the home that offers the career and 
    technical education and training desired by the enrollee pursuant 
    to paragraph (1) if the parent or guardian of the enrollee objects 
    to the assignment.

451 et seq.).
    (b) Period of Enrollment.--No individual may be enrolled in the Job 
Corps for more than 2 years, except--
        (1) in a case in which completion of an advanced career 
    training program under section 148(c) would require an individual 
    to participate in the Job Corps for not more than one additional 
    year;
        (2) in the case of an individual with a disability who would 
    reasonably be expected to meet the standards for a Job Corps 
    graduate, as defined under section 142(5), if allowed to 
    participate in the Job Corps for not more than 1 additional year;
        (3) in the case of an individual who participates in national 
    service, as authorized by a Civilian Conservation Center program, 
    who would be granted an enrollment extension in the Job Corps for 
    the amount of time equal to the period of national service; or

        of the subgrant agreement or contract, including carrying out

    demonstrated substantial compliance with the requirements of 
    paragraph (2), the Secretary may waive the imposition of sanctions 
    authorized by this section upon such recipient. The Secretary is 
    authorized to impose any sanction consistent with the provisions of

any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding 
under or related to this title, or has testified or is about to testify 
in any such proceeding or an investigation under or related to this 
title, or otherwise unlawfully denied to any individual a benefit to 
which that individual is entitled under the provisions of this title,
