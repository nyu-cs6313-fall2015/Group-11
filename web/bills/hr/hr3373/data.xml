  <summary>10/29/2013--Introduced.
Healthcare.gov Spending Accountability Act - Prohibits any federal official, including the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), from incurring any obligations respecting the repair or maintenance of the healthcare.gov website, unless: (1) the President submits to Congress proposed reductions in Affordable Care Act federal spending commensurate with the amount of obligations to be so incurred, and (2) Congress enacts a law that effects spending reductions commensurate with that amount.

States that, for purposes of such prohibition, Affordable Care Act spending is federal spending to carry out the provisions of, including amendments made by, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or title I or subtitle B of title II of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.</summary>
