                                 A BILL


 
 To provide for the coverage of medically necessary food under Federal 
                health programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Foods Equity Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Newborns are screened for inborn errors of metabolism, 
        but treatment for such conditions is not uniformly covered by 
        insurance.
            (2) Each year approximately 2,550 children in the United 
        States are diagnosed with an inborn error of metabolism 
        disorder, requiring foods modified to be void of the nutrient 
        or nutrients the child's body is incapable of processing, or 
        requiring supplementation with vitamins or amino acids.
            (3) More than 35 States have passed laws to at least 
        partially address the inequity in coverage for medically 
        necessary foods, critical treatment for such disorders.
            (4) The cost associated with providing medically necessary 
        foods presents a large financial burden for many families.
            (5) There is no current cure for inborn errors of 
        metabolism disorders and treatment is necessary during the 
        entire lifespan of the individual.

              NECESSARY FOOD AND FOOD MODIFIED TO BE LOW PROTEIN.
