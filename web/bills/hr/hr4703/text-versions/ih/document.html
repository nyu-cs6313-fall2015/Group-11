  demand for commercial sex acts under the minimum standards for the 
                      elimination of trafficking.

SECTION 1. AMENDMENT RELATING TO DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO EFFORTS 
              OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO REDUCE DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL SEX

Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7106) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(c) Criteria With Respect to Commercial Sex Acts.--In 
determinations under subsection (b)(12)(A), if the government of the 
country has the authority to prohibit the purchase of commercial sex 
acts and fails to do so, such failure to prohibit the purchase of 
commercial sex acts shall be deemed to be a failure on the part of the 
government to make serious and sustained efforts to reduce the demand 
for commercial sex acts, notwithstanding other efforts made by the 
government to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) takes 
effect on the date of the enactment of this Act and applies with 
respect to determinations under subsection (b)(12)(A) of section 108 of 
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 that are made on or 
after such date of enactment.
