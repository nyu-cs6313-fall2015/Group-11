SEC. 2. REPEAL OF REGULATIONS REQUIRED BEFORE ISSUANCE OF A NEW RULE.

            (1) Requirement for rule.--An agency may not issue a rule 
        unless such agency has repealed two or more rules described in 
        paragraph (4) that, to the extent practicable, are related to 
        the rule.
            (2) Requirement for major rule.--
                    (A) Repeal required.--An agency may not issue a 
                major rule unless--
                            (i) such agency has repealed two or more 
                        rules described in paragraph (4) that, to the 
                        extent practicable, are related to the major 
                        rule; and
                            (ii) the cost of the new major rule is less 
                        than or equal to the cost of the rules 
                        repealed.
                    (B) Certified cost.--For any rule issued in 
                accordance with subparagraph (A), the Administrator of 
                the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the 
                Office of Management and Budget must have certified 
                that the cost of the new major rule is equal to or less 
                that the cost of the rules repealed.
            (3) Publication required.--Any rule repealed under 
        paragraph (1) or (2) shall be published in the Federal 
        Register.
            (4) Applicability.--This section--
                    (A) applies to any rule or major rule that imposes 
                a cost or responsibility on a nongovernmental person or 
                a State or local government; and
                    (B) shall not apply to any rule or major rule--

                        practice of an agency or procurement by the 
                        agency; or
                            (ii) that is being revised to be less 
                        burdensome to decrease requirements imposed by 
                        the rule or cost of compliance.
