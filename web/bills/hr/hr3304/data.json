Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to submit an assessment of the risks to the health and safety of members of the Armed Forces (members) of the ejection seats currently in operational use by the Air Force.\n\nTitle II: Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation - Subtitle A: Authorization of Appropriations - (Sec. 201) Authorizes appropriations for FY2014 for DOD for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&E), in amounts specified in the funding table.\n\nSubtitle B: Program Requirements, Restrictions, and Limitations - (Sec. 211) Revises, generally, elements of the biennial strategic plan of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Requires quarterly cost reports from the Secretary of the Navy until such system receives such approval. Directs the Secretary of Defense to include within FY2015 budget materials individual project lines for each segment of such system, as well as costs and other information associated with technology development for each segment.

Provides a conditional delimiting date for such reviews and reports.\n\n(Sec. 214) Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of more than 85% of the funds authorized for Air Force logistics information technology until 30 days after the Secretary of the Air Force reports on how such systems will be modernized and updated following the cancellation of the expeditionary combat support system.\n\n(Sec. 215) Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of more than 90% of the funds authorized for Air Force defensive cyberspace operations until 30 days after the Secretary of the Air Force reports on the Application Software Assurance Center of Excellence.\n\n(Sec. 216) Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of more than 50% of the funds authorized for the precision extended range munition program until the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) certifies to the committees concerning the necessity of such program and that a sufficient business case exists to proceed with the development and production of such program.\n\n(Sec. 217) Directs the Secretary of the Air Force to develop a follow-on air-launched cruise missile to the AGM-86 (long-range strike bomber) that achieves initial operating capability for both conventional and nuclear missions.

Requires an additional report on current plans for long-term sustainment of the autonomic logistics information system of such aircraft.\n\n(Sec. 219) Requires, in DOD budget materials for FY2015 and thereafter, each capability component within the distributed common ground system program to be set forth as a separate project code and each project official to submit supporting justification for the project code. Directs the Under Secretary to analyze the capability components that are compliant with intelligence community data standards and that could be used to meet the requirements of such program. Requires the Under Secretary to report analysis results.\n\n(Sec. 220) Expresses the sense of Congress confirming: (1) the policy to demonstrate, acquire, and deploy an effective capability for operationally responsive space to support military users and operations from space; and (2) that the Operationally Responsive Space Program Office has demonstrated an ability to accomplish many of the policy objectives, while not executing a mission that leverages all such objectives in a single mission. Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of more than 50% of the FY 2014 funding for the space-based infrared systems space modernization initiative wide-field-of-view testbed until the Executive Agent for Space of DOD certifies that the Secretary is carrying out the Operationally Responsive Space Program Office in accordance with federal requirements.
