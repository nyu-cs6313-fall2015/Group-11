Requires any person claiming the benefit of such an exception to bear the burden of providing the appropriate evidence.\n\n Authorizes the Attorney General to issue an order adding a drug or other substance to the definition of \"anabolic steroid\" upon finding that: (1) the substance satisfies the criteria for being considered an anabolic steroid, and (2) such addition will assist in preventing abuse or misuse of the substance.\n\n Prohibits importing, exporting, manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense any anabolic steroid, or any product containing an anabolic steroid, unless it bears a label clearly identifying the anabolic steroid by the nomenclature used by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Prescribes penalties. Sets forth an exemption from such IUPAC nomenclature requirement if such product is labeled in the manner required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as described in this Act.\n\nAuthorizes the Attorney General to: (1) collect data and analyze products to determine\u00a0whether they contain anabolic steroids and are properly labeled, and (2) publish a list of products containing an anabolic steroid that are not properly labeled."
