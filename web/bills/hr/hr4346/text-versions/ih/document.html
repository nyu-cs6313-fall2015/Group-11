United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``NATO Alliance Recognition and 
Promotion Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On March 12, 2014, the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO) marks the 15th anniversary of enlargement 
        through the accession of 3 Central European countries: the 
        Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary.
            (2) On March 29, 2014, NATO marks the 10th anniversary of 
        enlargement through the accession of 7 Central European 
        countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, 
        Slovakia, and Slovenia.
            (3) On April 7, 2014, NATO marks the 5th anniversary of 
        enlargement through the accession of Albania and Croatia.
            (4) The incorporation of these European countries into NATO 
        has contributed toward a vision of Europe that is aimed at 
        promoting stability and cooperation, at building a Europe whole 
        and free, united in peace, democracy and common values.
            (5) Since joining the Alliance, these 12 member states have 
        contributed to numerous NATO-led peace and security and 
        stability operations, including participation in the 
        International Security Assistance Force's (ISAF) mission in 
        Afghanistan.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF CONGRESS.

    Congress declares that--
            (1) NATO has been the cornerstone of transatlantic security 
        cooperation and an enduring instrument for promoting stability 
        in Europe and around the world for over sixty-five years;
            (2) the incorporation of the Czech Republic, Poland, 
        Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, 
        Slovakia, Slovenia, Albania, and Croatia has been essential to 
        the success of NATO in this modern era;
            (3) the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Estonia, 
        Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Albania and 
        Croatia has over time added to and strengthened the list of key 
        European allies of the United States;
            (4) since joining NATO, these member states have remained 
        committed to the collective defense of the Alliance and have 
        demonstrated their will and ability to contribute to 
        transatlantic solidarity and assume increasingly more 
        responsibility for international peace and security;
            (5) these NATO member states have become reliable partners 
        and supporters of aspiring members, and the United States 
        recognizes their continued efforts to aid in further 
        enlargement initiatives; and
            (6) the commitment by these NATO members to Alliance 
        principles and active participation in Alliance initiatives 
        shows the success of NATO's Open-Door Policy.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should remain committed to 
        maintaining a military presence in Europe as a means of 
        promoting allied interoperability and providing visible 
        assurance to NATO allies in the region; and
            (2) at the September 2014 NATO Summit in Wales, the United 
        States, along with NATO allies, should continue to pursue 
        enlargement initiatives for the aspirant countries.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
