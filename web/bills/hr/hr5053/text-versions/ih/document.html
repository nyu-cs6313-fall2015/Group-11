                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection 
  Reauthorization Act of 2008 to provide for the expedited removal of 
 unaccompanied alien children who are not victims of a severe form of 
trafficking in persons and who do not have a fear of returning to their 
   country of nationality or last habitual residence, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Expedited Family Reunification Act 
of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) President Obama, on June 15, 2012, during the Rose 
        Garden speech, announced a unilateral administrative change in 
        United States immigration policy that the administration will 
        not enforce broad swaths of immigration laws, including that 
        the administration would not deport illegal immigrants brought 
        to the United States as young children.
            (2) An estimated 90,000 unaccompanied alien children are 
        likely to illegally enter the United States this year alone.
            (3) These children are targeted by human traffickers, drug 
        cartels, and other criminal organizations, and run the risk of 
        being kidnapped, raped, killed, or otherwise harmed.
            (4) Returning these illegal immigrants to their families in 
        their home countries would allow them to be safe, free from 
        harm, and help reduce future flow.

SEC. 3. REPATRIATION OF UNACCOMPANIED ALIEN CHILDREN.

    Section 235(a) of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims 
Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (2)--
                    (A) by amending the heading to read as follows: 
                ``Rules for unaccompanied alien children.'';
                    (B) in subparagraph (A), in the matter preceding 
                clause (i), by striking ``who is a national or habitual 
                resident of a country that is contiguous with the 
                United States''; and
                    (C) in subparagraph (C)--
                            (i) by amending the heading to read as 
                        follows: ``Agreements with foreign countries''; 
                        and
                            (ii) in the matter preceding clause (i), by 
                        inserting after ``countries contiguous to the 
                        United States'' the following ``, as well as 
                        Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
                        Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and any other 
                        foreign country that the Secretary determines 
                        appropriate,''; and
            (2) in paragraph (5)(D), in the matter preceding clause 
        (i), by striking ``, except for an unaccompanied alien child 
        from a contiguous country subject to the exceptions under 
        subsection (a)(2),'' and inserting ``who does not meet the 
        criteria listed in paragraph (2)(A)''.

SEC. 4. APPLICABILITY.

    The amendments made by section 2 shall apply to any unaccompanied 
alien child who was apprehended on or after June 15, 2012.
