SEC. 2. INSURANCE OF AMOUNTS HELD ON BEHALF OF OTHERS.
    Section 207(k) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1787(k)) 
is amended--
        (1) in paragraph (1)(A)--
            (A) by inserting after ``payable to any member'' the 
        following: ``, or to any person with funds lawfully held in a 
        member account,''; and

        ``(5) Coverage for interest on lawyers trust accounts (iolta) 
    and other similar escrow accounts.--
            ``(A) Pass-through insurance.--The Administration shall 
        provide pass-through share insurance for the deposits or shares 
        of any interest on lawyers trust account (IOLTA) or other 
        similar escrow accounts.
            ``(B) Treatment of ioltas.--
                ``(i) Treatment as escrow accounts.--For share 
            insurance purposes, IOLTAs are treated as escrow accounts.
                ``(ii) Treatment as member accounts.--IOLTAs and other 
            similar escrow accounts are considered member accounts for 
            purposes of paragraph (1), if the attorney administering 
            the IOLTA or the escrow agent administering the escrow 
            account is a member of the insured credit union in which 
            the funds are held.
            ``(C) Definitions.--For purposes of this paragraph:
                ``(i) Interest on lawyers trust account.--The terms 
            `interest on lawyers trust account' and `IOLTA' mean a 
            system in which lawyers place certain client funds in 
            interest-bearing or dividend-bearing accounts, with the 
            interest or dividends then used to fund programs such as 
            legal service organizations who provide services to clients 
            in need.
                ``(ii) Pass-through share insurance.--The term `pass-
            through share insurance' means, with respect to IOLTAs and 
            other similar escrow accounts, insurance coverage based on 
            the interest of each person on whose behalf funds are held 
            in such accounts by the attorney administering the IOLTA or 
            the escrow agent administering a similar escrow account, in 
            accordance with regulations issued by the Administration.
            ``(D) Rule of construction.--No provision of this paragraph 
        shall be construed as authorizing an insured credit union to 
        accept the deposits of an IOLTA or similar escrow account in an 
        amount greater than such credit union is authorized to accept 
        under any other provision of Federal or State law.''.
