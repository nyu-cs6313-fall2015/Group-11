                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Military Construction Authorization Act, 1974 to authorize 
   the Secretary of Defense to decontaminate certain portions of the 
     former bombardment area on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. USE OF FORMER BOMBARDMENT AREA ON ISLAND OF CULEBRA, PUERTO 
              RICO.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
statutory prohibition restricting environmental cleanup of the former 
bombardment area on the island of Culebra, Puerto Rico, is a unique 
anomaly for the Department of Defense and its formerly used defense 
sites.
    (b) Modification of Restriction on Federal Decontamination 
Authority.--Section 204(c) of the Military Construction Authorization 
Act, 1974 (Public Law 93-166; 87 Stat. 668) is amended by adding at the 
end the following new sentence: ``The first sentence of this subsection 
shall not apply to the portions of the former bombardment area that 
were identified as having regular public access in the Department of 
Defense study entitled `Study Relating to the Presence of Unexploded 
Ordnance in a Portion of the Former Naval Bombardment Area of Culebra 
Island, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico' and dated April 20, 2012, which 
was prepared in accordance with section 2815 of the Ike Skelton 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 
111-383; 124 Stat. 4464).''.
