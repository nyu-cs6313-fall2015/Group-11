  To amend title II of the Social Security Act to provide for the non-
application of the waiting period for disability insurance benefits in 
     cases of terminally ill beneficiaries, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Jeremy Sanchez Social Security 
Disability Insurance Fairness Act''.

SEC. 2. NON-APPLICATION OF WAITING PERIOD FOR DISABILITY INSURANCE 
              BENEFITS IN CASES OF TERMINALLY ILL BENEFICIARIES.

    Section 223(a) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 423(a)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3)(A) In the case of any application for disability 
        insurance benefits filed by an individual who is determined to 
        be under a disability, paragraph (1) shall be applied without 
        regard to the waiting period referred to in such paragraph if--
                    ``(i) the individual is terminally ill, or
                    ``(ii) the Commissioner of Social Security 
                determines that the application of the waiting period 
                would work an undue hardship on such individual (as 
                determined on the basis of criteria established by the 
                Commissioner).
            ``(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, an individual is 
        considered to be terminally ill if the individual has a medical 
        prognosis that the individual's life expectancy is 12 months or 
        less.''.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    The amendment made by section 2 shall apply with respect to 
applications for monthly insurance benefits filed on or after the date 
of the enactment of this Act.
                                 <all>
