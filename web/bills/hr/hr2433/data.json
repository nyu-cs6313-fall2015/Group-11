Defines \"human cloning\" to mean the implantation of the product of transferring the nuclear material of a human somatic cell into an egg cell from which the nuclear material has been removed or rendered inert into a uterus or the functional equivalent of a uterus. Requires the Secretary to update the guidelines maintained pursuant to this Act for consistency with such prohibition.\n\nRequires the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to include information on human stem cells in the biennial report to Congress."
