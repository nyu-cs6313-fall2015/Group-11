                                 A BILL


 
  To designate a Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial at the 
            March Field Air Museum in Riverside, California.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Distinguished Flying Cross National 
Memorial Act''.

SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS NATIONAL MEMORIAL IN 
              RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The most reliable statistics regarding the number of 
        members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the 
        Distinguished Flying Cross indicate that 126,318 members of the 
        Armed Forces received the medal during World War II, 
        approximately 21,000 members received the medal during the 
        Korean conflict, and 21,647 members received the medal during 
        the Vietnam War. Since the end of the Vietnam War, more than 
        203 Armed Forces members have received the medal in times of 
        conflict.
            (2) The National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, 
        Missouri, burned down in 1973, and thus many more recipients of 
        the Distinguished Flying Cross may be undocumented. Currently, 
        the Department of Defense continues to locate and identify 
        members of the Armed Forces who have received the medal and are 
        undocumented.
            (3) The United States currently lacks a national memorial 
        dedicated to the bravery and sacrifice of those members of the 
        Armed Forces who have distinguished themselves by heroic deeds 
        performed in aerial flight.
            (4) An appropriate memorial to current and former members 
        of the Armed Forces is under construction at March Field Air 
        Museum in Riverside, California.
            (5) This memorial will honor all those members of the Armed 
        Forces who have distinguished themselves in aerial flight, 
        whether documentation of such members who earned the 
        Distinguished Flying Cross exists or not.
    (b) Designation.--The memorial to members of the Armed Forces who 
have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, located at March 
Field Air Museum in Riverside, California, is hereby designated as the 
Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial.
    (c) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial designated by 
this section is not a unit of the National Park System, and the 
designation of the national memorial shall not be construed to require 
or permit Federal funds to be expended for any purpose related to the 
national memorial.
