  <summary>11/19/2014--Passed House amended.
Malala Yousafzai Scholarship Act - (Sec. 3) Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) every individual, regardless of gender, should have the opportunity to pursue an education free from the fear of discrimination; (2) educational exchanges promote institutional linkages between the United States and Pakistan; and (3) recipients of scholarships under the Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program (Program) should commit to improving their local communities. (The Program awards scholarships for university study to academically talented, financially needy Pakistani students.)

Encourages the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to continue to support Pakistani education initiatives, especially those for women.

(Sec. 4) Directs the USAID Administrator to award at least 50% of the scholarships available under the Program to women for each of calendar years 2014-2016.

Requires the scholarships to be awarded: (1) in accordance with existing scholarship criteria, and (2) for a range of disciplines to improve the employability of graduates and to meet the needs of the scholarship recipients.

 Directs the USAID Administrator to: (1) make every effort to award 50% of the scholarships available under the Program to Pakistani women; and (2) consult with, and leverage investments by, the Pakistani private sector and Pakistani diaspora communities in the United States to improve, expand, and sustain education programs in Pakistan.

(Sec. 5) Requires the USAID to brief Congress, annually for the next four years, on the implementation of this Act's requirements, including specified information regarding Program scholarships.</summary>
