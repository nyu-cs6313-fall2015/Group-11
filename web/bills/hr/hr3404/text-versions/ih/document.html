                                 A BILL


 
To require that every mammography summary delivered to a patient after 
  a mammography examination, as required by section 354 of the Public 
 Health Service Act (commonly referred to as the ``Mammography Quality 
 Standards Act of 1992''), contain information regarding the patient's 
 breast density and language communicating that individuals with more 
 dense breasts may benefit from supplemental screening tests, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Density and Mammography 
Reporting Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The American Cancer Society reports that an individual 
        with dense breast tissue faces a relative risk of developing 
        breast cancer 4 or more times higher than an individual without 
        dense breast tissue.
            (2) The National Cancer Institute estimates that 1 in 8 
        women in the United States will develop a cancer of the breast 
        in their lifetime.
            (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 
        that breast cancer is the number one cause of cancer death 
        among Hispanic women, and the number two cause of cancer death 
        among White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American 
        Indian/Alaska Native women.
            (4) Individuals receiving mammograms are not currently 
        required to receive medical summaries or reports from their 
        mammogram providers which address breast density or its 
        correlation to breast cancer, despite the fact that the 
        radiologist interpreting the mammogram makes an assessment of 
        the patient's breast density.

SEC. 3. BREAST DENSITY REPORTING BY FACILITIES THAT PERFORM MAMMOGRAMS 
              TO PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS.

    (a) In General.--Clause (ii) of section 354(f)(1)(G) of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 263b(f)(1)(G)) is amended--

                        information regarding the patient's individual 
                        measure of breast density, as specified by the 
                        Secretary based upon--
                                    ``(aa) current scientific

                                with the practice of medical experts in 
                                the field;

                            ``(VII) the summary under subclause (IV) 
                        shall include language, developed by the 
                        Secretary in consultation with leading experts, 
                        communicating that individuals with more dense 
                        breasts--
                                    ``(aa) may benefit from 
                                supplemental screening tests; and
                                    ``(bb) should talk with their 
                                physicians about any questions or 
                                concerns regarding the summary; and''.

this section shall not be construed to alter in any way Federal 
requirements relating to financial obligations of any person in 
connection with health insurance.
    (c) No Preemption.--This section and the amendments made by this 
section shall not be construed to preempt any State requirements 
relating to reporting on a patient's individual measure of breast 
density.
