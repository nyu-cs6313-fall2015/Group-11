                calories per serving, or the number of calories per the 
                common unit division of the product, such as for a 
                multi-serving item that is typically divided before 
                presentation to the consumer'';
                    (B) in item (II)(aa), by striking ``the number of

                        food establishments where the majority of 
                        orders are placed by customers who are off-
                        premises at the time such order is placed, the

                or labeling of one preset standard build. In addition 
                to such methods, the Secretary may allow the use of 
                other methods, to be determined by the Secretary, for 
                which there is a reasonable basis (as such term is used 
                in subclause (iv)).''; and
