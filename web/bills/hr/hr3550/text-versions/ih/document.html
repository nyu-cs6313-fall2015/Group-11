      Subtitle C--Bankruptcy, Not Bailouts, for Complex Financial 
                              Institutions

SEC. 221. REFORMING THE BANKRUPTCY CODE TO ACCOMMODATE FAILING 
              FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Bailouts undermine market discipline and the rule of 
        law, resulting in doubt about property rights and insulating 
        recipients from the consequences of their mistakes.
            (2) A number of complex financial institutions are widely 
        considered to be ``too big to fail''.
            (3) An aggravating factor in the 2008 financial crisis was 
        uncertainty about the security and priority of claims stemming 
        from cross-border resolution of complex financial institutions.
            (4) The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has 
        historically resolved most failing U.S. depository institutions 
        and has the necessary expertise and discretionary authority to 
        conduct such resolutions quickly.
            (5) The FDIC's authority did not extend to all components 
        of very large, complex financial institutions, such as 
        insurance, stockbroker, and commodity broker operations.
            (6) The U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to establish 
        ``uniform laws on the subject of Bankruptcies through the 
        United States''.
            (7) Bankruptcy provides predictable priority for claims 
        under the rule of law through the jurisdiction of an Article 
        III court.
            (8) The lengthy adjudication of claims to ensure equality 
        under the law of similarly situated creditors under bankruptcy 
        can be problematic in the case of financial institutions but 
        can be amended to preserve and protect value.
            (9) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
        Protection Act did not establish a non-discretionary, rule-of-
        law-based resolution process to provide certainty for creditors 
        of failing institutions.
            (10) A credible resolution process could eliminate the use 
        of bailouts and other political interventions.
            (11) Additional reforms are necessary to bring certainty 
        and predictability to the failure of large, complex, 
        multinational financial institutions.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Committees on the Judiciary and Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Committees on the Judiciary and Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate should each report legislation 
proposing changes to existing law within each committee's jurisdiction 
with provisions to accommodate bankruptcy proceedings for failing 
multinational financial institutions. Such committees should consider 
reforms that--
            (1) establish a new chapter of the bankruptcy code 
        specifically for financial institutions, to be used in 
        conjunction with the existing chapter 7 liquidation or chapter 
        11 reorganization process;
            (2) replace or supplement existing resolution authorities 
        for certain kinds of institutions;
            (3) clarify that such resolution proceedings occur at the 
        holding company level;
            (4) designate particular judges in the Second and D.C. 
        Circuits who will hear these cases and who may appoint special 
        masters with technical expertise to aid in the resolution;
            (5) continue to use FDIC expertise to resolve such 
        institutions under the oversight of the court;
            (6) remove exemptions from bankruptcy proceedings for 
        certain subsidiaries of complex financial institutions, such as 
        insurance and brokerage operations;
            (7) allow primary regulators to petition for involuntary 
        bankruptcy cases against a financial institution, to have 
        standing and raise motions, and to file plans of 
        reorganization;
            (8) establish procedures for debtor-in-possession financing 
        to provide partial or complete payouts to some or all creditors 
        in certain circumstances;
            (9) develop rules for the applicability of short-term 
        automatic stays for certain qualified financial contracts;
            (10) recapitalize reorganized institutions at the holding 
        company level, possibly by converting long-term debt into 
        equity;
            (11) collaborate with foreign governments to avoid domestic 
        ``ring-fencing'' of failing multinational financial 
        institutions whose holding companies are located elsewhere;
            (12) ensure that institutions in conservatorship do not 
        receive advantageous tax or regulatory treatment over 
        comparable financial institutions outside of the bankruptcy 
        process; and
            (13) such other additional and conforming reforms as the 
        Committees consider necessary.
