this Act are allocated to States and units of general local government 
with the greatest need, as such need is determined in the discretion of 
the Secretary based on--
            (1) the number and percentage of home foreclosures in each 
        State or unit of general local government;
            (2) the number and percentage of homes in default or

        grantee capacity and performance, number and percentage of 
        commercial foreclosures, overall economic conditions, and other 
        market needs data, as determined by the Secretary.
    (d) Competition Criteria.--
            (1) Eligible entities.--For the funds distributed 
        competitively, eligible entities shall be States, units of

        activities to address identified conditions, and any additional 
        factors determined by the Secretary.
            (3) Minimum grant size.--The Secretary may establish a 
        minimum grant size.
            (4) Publication of criteria.--The Secretary shall publish 
        competition criteria for any grants awarded under this Act not
