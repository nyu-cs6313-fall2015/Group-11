                                 A BILL


 
  To direct the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity 
  Futures Trading Commission to jointly adopt rules setting forth the 
 application to cross-border swaps transactions of certain provisions 
  relating to swaps that were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
               Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Swap Jurisdiction Certainty Act''.

SEC. 2. JOINT RULEMAKING ON CROSS-BORDER SWAPS.

    (a) Joint Rulemaking Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than &lt;DELETED&gt;180 days&lt;/DELETED&gt; 
        270 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
        Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures 
        Trading Commission shall jointly issue rules setting forth the 
        application of United States swaps requirements of the 
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Commodity Exchange Act 
        relating to cross-border swaps and security-based swaps 
        &lt;DELETED&gt;transacted between&lt;/DELETED&gt; transactions involving 
        U.S. persons &lt;DELETED&gt;and&lt;/DELETED&gt; or non-U.S. persons.
            (2) Construction.--The &lt;DELETED&gt;Commissions shall jointly 
        issue the&lt;/DELETED&gt; rules required under paragraph (1) shall be 
        identical, notwithstanding any difference in the authorities 
        granted the Commissions in &lt;DELETED&gt;sections 30(c) and 36(c)&lt;/DELETED&gt; 
        section 30(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 
        78dd(c)&lt;DELETED&gt;; 78mm(c)&lt;/DELETED&gt;) and section 2(i) of the 
        Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 2(i)), respectively, except to 
        the extent necessary to accommodate differences in other 
        underlying statutory requirements under such Acts, and the 
        rules thereunder.
    (b) Considerations.--The Commissions shall jointly issue rules that 
address--
            (1) the nature of the connections to the United States that 
        require a non-U.S. person to register as a swap dealer, major 
        swap participant, security-based swap dealer, or major 
        security-based swap participant under each Commission's 
        respective Acts and the regulations issued under such Acts;
            (2) which of the United States swaps requirements shall 
        apply to the swap and security-based swap activities of non-
        U.S. persons, U.S. persons, and their branches, agencies, 
        subsidiaries, and affiliates outside of the United States and 
        the extent to which such requirements shall apply; and
            (3) the circumstances under which a non-U.S. person in 
        compliance with the regulatory requirements of a foreign 
        jurisdiction shall be exempt from United States swaps 
        requirements.
    (c) Rule in Accordance With APA Required.--No guidance, memorandum 
of understanding, or any such other agreement may satisfy the 
requirement to issue a joint rule from the Commissions in accordance 
with section 553 of title 5, United States Code.
    (d) General Application to &lt;DELETED&gt;G20 Member Nations &lt;/DELETED&gt; 
Countries or Administrative Regions Having Nine Largest Markets.--
            (1) General application.--In issuing rules under this 
        section, the Commissions shall provide that a non-U.S. person 
        in compliance with the swaps regulatory requirements of a 
        &lt;DELETED&gt;G20 member nation&lt;/DELETED&gt; country or administrative 
        region that has one of the nine largest combined swap and 
        security-based swap markets by notional amount in the calendar 
        year preceding issuance of such rules, or other foreign 
        jurisdiction as jointly determined by the Commissions, shall be 
        exempt from United States swaps requirements in accordance with 
        the schedule set forth in paragraph (2), unless the Commissions 
        jointly determine that the regulatory requirements of 
        &lt;DELETED&gt;the G20 member nation&lt;/DELETED&gt; such country or 
        administrative region or other foreign jurisdiction are not 
        broadly equivalent to United States swaps requirements.
            (2) Effective date schedule.--The exemption described in 
        paragraph (1) and set forth under the rules required by this 
        section shall apply to persons or transactions relating to or 
        involving--
                    (A) &lt;DELETED&gt;G20 member nations&lt;/DELETED&gt; countries 
                or administrative regions described in such paragraph, 
                or any other foreign jurisdiction as jointly determined 
                by the Commissions, accounting for the five largest 
                combined swap and security-based swap markets by 
                notional amount in the calendar year preceding issuance 
                of such rules, on the date on which final rules are 
                issued under this section; and
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) G20 member nations, or any other 
                foreign jurisdiction as jointly determined by the 
                Commissions, accounting for the next five largest 
                combined swap and security-based swap markets by 
                notional amount in the calendar year preceding issuance 
                of such rules, 1 year after the date on which such 
                rules are issued; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the remaining G20 member nations, and 
                any other foreign jurisdiction as jointly determined by 
                the Commissions, 18 months after the date on which such 
                rules are issued.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                    (B) the remaining countries or administrative 
                regions described in such paragraph, and any other 
                foreign jurisdiction as jointly determined by the 
                Commissions, 1 year after the date on which such rules 
                are issued.
            (3) Criteria.--In such rules, the Commissions shall jointly 
        establish criteria for determining that one or more categories 
        of regulatory requirements of a &lt;DELETED&gt;G20 member nation&lt;/DELETED&gt; 
        country or administrative region described in paragraph (1) or 
        other foreign jurisdiction is not broadly equivalent to United 
        States swaps requirements and shall jointly determine the 
        appropriate application of certain United States swap 
        requirements to persons or transactions relating to or 
        involving &lt;DELETED&gt;that G20 member nation&lt;/DELETED&gt; such 
        country or administrative region or other foreign jurisdiction. 
        Such criteria shall include the scope and objectives of the 
        regulatory requirements of a &lt;DELETED&gt;G20 member nation&lt;/DELETED&gt; 
        country or administrative region described in paragraph (1) or 
        other foreign jurisdiction as well as the effectiveness of the 
        supervisory compliance program administered, and the 
        enforcement authority exercised, by such &lt;DELETED&gt;G20 member 
        nation&lt;/DELETED&gt; country or administrative region or other 
        foreign jurisdiction, and such other factors as the 
        Commissions, by rule, jointly determine to be necessary or 
        appropriate in the public interest.
            (4) Required assessment.--Beginning on &lt;DELETED&gt;after&lt;/DELETED&gt; 
        the date on which final rules are issued under this section, 
        the Commissions shall begin to jointly assess the regulatory 
        requirements of &lt;DELETED&gt;G20 member nations&lt;/DELETED&gt; countries 
        or administrative regions described in paragraph (1), as the 
        Commissions jointly determine appropriate, in accordance with 
        the criteria established pursuant to &lt;DELETED&gt;paragraph (3)&lt;/DELETED&gt; 
        this subsection, to determine if one or more categories of 
        regulatory requirements of &lt;DELETED&gt;a G20 member nation&lt;/DELETED&gt; 
        such a country or administrative region or other foreign 
        jurisdiction is not broadly equivalent to United States swaps 
        requirements.
    (e) Report to Congress.--If the Commissions make the joint 
determination described in subsection (d)(1) that the regulatory 
requirements of &lt;DELETED&gt;the G20 member nation&lt;/DELETED&gt; a country or 
administrative region described in such subsection or other foreign 
jurisdiction are not broadly equivalent to United States swaps 
requirements, the Commissions shall articulate the basis for such a 
determination in a written report transmitted to the Committee on 
Financial Services and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of 
the Senate within 30 days of the determination. The determination shall 
not be effective until the transmission of such report.

        effectively carry out the purposes of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 
        8301 et seq.) and any rules or regulations prescribed by the 
        Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures
