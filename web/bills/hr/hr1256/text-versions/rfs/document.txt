                                 AN ACT


 
  To direct the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity 
  Futures Trading Commission to jointly adopt rules setting forth the 
 application to cross-border swaps transactions of certain provisions 
  relating to swaps that were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall 
               Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Swap Jurisdiction Certainty Act''.

SEC. 2. JOINT RULEMAKING ON CROSS-BORDER SWAPS.

    (a) Joint Rulemaking Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 270 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
        and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall jointly 
        issue rules setting forth the application of United States 
        swaps requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and 
        the Commodity Exchange Act relating to cross-border swaps and 
        security-based swaps transactions involving U.S. persons or 
        non-U.S. persons.
            (2) Construction.--The rules required under paragraph (1) 
        shall be identical, notwithstanding any difference in the 
        authorities granted the Commissions in section 30(c) of the 
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78dd(c)) and section 
        2(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 2(i)), 
        respectively, except to the extent necessary to accommodate 
        differences in other underlying statutory requirements under 
        such Acts, and the rules thereunder.
    (b) Considerations.--The Commissions shall jointly issue rules that 
address--
            (1) the nature of the connections to the United States that 
        require a non-U.S. person to register as a swap dealer, major 
        swap participant, security-based swap dealer, or major 
        security-based swap participant under each Commission's 
        respective Acts and the regulations issued under such Acts;
            (2) which of the United States swaps requirements shall 
        apply to the swap and security-based swap activities of non-
        U.S. persons, U.S. persons, and their branches, agencies, 
        subsidiaries, and affiliates outside of the United States and 
        the extent to which such requirements shall apply; and
            (3) the circumstances under which a non-U.S. person in 
        compliance with the regulatory requirements of a foreign 
        jurisdiction shall be exempt from United States swaps 
        requirements.
    (c) Rule in Accordance With APA Required.--No guidance, memorandum 
of understanding, or any such other agreement may satisfy the 
requirement to issue a joint rule from the Commissions in accordance 
with section 553 of title 5, United States Code.
    (d) General Application to Countries or Administrative Regions 
Having Nine Largest Markets.--
            (1) General application.--In issuing rules under this 
        section, the Commissions shall provide that a non-U.S. person 
        in compliance with the swaps regulatory requirements of a 
        country or administrative region that has one of the nine 
        largest combined swap and security-based swap markets by 
        notional amount in the calendar year preceding issuance of such 
        rules, or other foreign jurisdiction as jointly determined by 
        the Commissions, shall be exempt from United States swaps 
        requirements in accordance with the schedule set forth in 
        paragraph (2), unless the Commissions jointly determine that 
        the regulatory requirements of such country or administrative 
        region or other foreign jurisdiction are not broadly equivalent 
        to United States swaps requirements.
            (2) Effective date schedule.--The exemption described in 
        paragraph (1) and set forth under the rules required by this 
        section shall apply to persons or transactions relating to or 
        involving--
                    (A) countries or administrative regions described 
                in such paragraph, or any other foreign jurisdiction as 
                jointly determined by the Commissions, accounting for 
                the five largest combined swap and security-based swap 
                markets by notional amount in the calendar year 
                preceding issuance of such rules, on the date on which 
                final rules are issued under this section; and
                    (B) the remaining countries or administrative 
                regions described in such paragraph, and any other 
                foreign jurisdiction as jointly determined by the 
                Commissions, 1 year after the date on which such rules 
                are issued.
            (3) Criteria.--In such rules, the Commissions shall jointly 
        establish criteria for determining that one or more categories 
        of regulatory requirements of a country or administrative 
        region described in paragraph (1) or other foreign jurisdiction 
        is not broadly equivalent to United States swaps requirements 
        and shall jointly determine the appropriate application of 
        certain United States swap requirements to persons or 
        transactions relating to or involving such country or 
        administrative region or other foreign jurisdiction. Such 
        criteria shall include the scope and objectives of the 
        regulatory requirements of a country or administrative region 
        described in paragraph (1) or other foreign jurisdiction as 
        well as the effectiveness of the supervisory compliance program 
        administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by such 
        country or administrative region or other foreign jurisdiction, 
        and such other factors as the Commissions, by rule, jointly 
        determine to be necessary or appropriate in the public 
        interest.
            (4) Required assessment.--Beginning on the date on which 
        final rules are issued under this section, the Commissions 
        shall begin to jointly assess the regulatory requirements of 
        countries or administrative regions described in paragraph (1), 
        as the Commissions jointly determine appropriate, in accordance 
        with the criteria established pursuant to this subsection, to 
        determine if one or more categories of regulatory requirements 
        of such a country or administrative region or other foreign 
        jurisdiction is not broadly equivalent to United States swaps 
        requirements.
    (e) Report to Congress.--If the Commissions make the joint 
determination described in subsection (d)(1) that the regulatory 
requirements of a country or administrative region described in such 
subsection or other foreign jurisdiction are not broadly equivalent to 
United States swaps requirements, the Commissions shall articulate the 
basis for such a determination in a written report transmitted to the 
Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Agriculture of the 
House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry 
of the Senate within 30 days of the determination. The determination 
shall not be effective until the transmission of such report.

issued pursuant to this Act, the following definitions apply:
