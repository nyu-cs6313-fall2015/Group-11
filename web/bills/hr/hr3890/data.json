Makes Medicare the primary payor for such individuals.\n\nAmends SSA title XVIII part C (Medicare+Choice Program) to direct the Secretary to establish procedures for the transition of special needs individuals to a Medicare Advantage plan qualified BCPs.\n\nProhibits any Medicare supplemental (Medigap) policy from covering cost-sharing for items and services (other than certain emergent services) furnished to an enrollee in a qualified BCP by a service provider or supplier that is not a qualified BCP professional.\n\nRevises requirements for the initial preventive physical examination (Welcome to Medicare visit) and annual wellness visits for BCP eligible individuals.\n\nDirects the Secretary, acting through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, to designate and provide core funding for at least three Chronic Care Innovation Centers.\n\nEstablishes new curricula requirements for direct and indirect graduate medical education payments that address the need for team-based care and chronic care management, including palliative medicine, chronic care management, leadership and team-based skills and planning, and leveraging technology as a care tool."
