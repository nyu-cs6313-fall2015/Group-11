    ``The Secretary shall provide to any veteran or person who receives 
educational assistance under the laws administered by the Secretary the 
option of making the veteran's or person's relevant records maintained 
by the Secretary, including information about the amount of educational 
assistance to which the veteran or person is entitled, available 
through an Internet website to the educational institution that 
provides the course of education in which the veteran or person is

        made available enters into an agreement with the Secretary 
        under which the institution agrees that such records will only 
        be made available for the purpose of counseling the veteran or 
        person in making decisions related to the veteran's or person's 
        education; and
            ``(2) no unauthorized person is given access to any record 
        made available to an educational institution under this 
        section, including by requiring the use of passwords and other 
        appropriate mechanisms for restricting access to the records by 
        unauthorized persons.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the beginning of 
such chapter is amended by adding at the end of the items relating to 
such subchapter the following new item:
