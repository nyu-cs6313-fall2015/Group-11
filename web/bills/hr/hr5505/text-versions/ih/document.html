    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Air, Strong Economies Act''.

SEC. 2. GROUND-LEVEL OZONE STANDARDS.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including regulations), 
in promulgating a national primary or secondary ambient air quality 
standard for ozone, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency--
            (1) shall not propose a national primary or secondary 
        ambient air quality standard for ozone that is lower than the 
        standard established under section 50.15 of title 40, Code of 
        Federal Regulations (as in effect on January 1, 2014), until at 
        least 85 percent of the counties that were nonattainment areas 
        under that standard as of January 1, 2014, achieve full 
        compliance with that standard;
            (2) shall only consider all or part of a county to be a 
        nonattainment area under the standard on the basis of direct 
        air quality monitoring;
            (3) shall take into consideration feasibility and cost; and
            (4) shall include in the regulatory impact analysis for the 
        proposed and final rule at least 1 analysis that does not 
        include any calculation of benefits resulting from reducing 
        emissions of any pollutant other than ozone.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
