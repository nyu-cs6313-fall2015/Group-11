To amend the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 
to allow intraagency transfers of funds to provide more flexibility for 
the agency to comply with a presidential sequestration order for fiscal 
                           year 2013 or 2014.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sequestration Flexibility Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. TRANSFER AUTHORITY.

    Section 251A of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901a) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new paragraph:
            ``(12) Transfer authority for fiscal year 2013 and 2014 
        appropriations.--The head of any department or agency of the 
        Government may transfer amounts within that department or 
        agency for fiscal year 2013 or for fiscal year 2014 in order to 
        lessen the effect of a presidential sequestration order for 
        that fiscal year on any program, project, or activity within 
        that department or agency, but no such transfer may cause any 
        account to be at a higher level than it was before such 
        sequestration.''.

SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL NOTICE.

    Not later than 15 days after any transfer under section 1, the head 
of any department or agency making any such transfer shall submit to 
the committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate with 
subject matter jurisdiction over such department or agency a report 
setting forth a description of the transfer, including the amount of 
the transfer and the accounts from and to which the funds were 
transferred.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
