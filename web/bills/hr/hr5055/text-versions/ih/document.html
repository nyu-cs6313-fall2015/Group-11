                        insurance program or the health insurance 
                        program is not continued by Ginnie Mae, the 
                        employee shall be permitted to select an 
                        alternate Federal health insurance program not

        risks to their communities, other institutions, or the broader

        causing, bringing about, participating in, counseling, or 
        aiding or abetting, a violation of the requirements under this 
        Act.
    (k) Resolution Authority.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        Federal law, the law of any State, or the constitution of any 
        State, the Director shall--
                    (A) have the authority to act, in the same manner 
                and to the same extent, with respect to a market 
                participant or participating aggregator that the 
                Director determines pursuant to is classified as 
                critically undercapitalized pursuant to subsection 
                (h)(2), as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
                has with respect to insured depository institutions 
                under subsections (c) through (s) of section 11 of the 
                Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1821), section 
                12 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
                1822), and section 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Act (12 U.S.C. 1823), while tailoring such actions to 
                the specific business model of the market participant 
                or participating aggregator, as the case may be, as may 
                be necessary to properly exercise such authority under 
                this subsection;
                    (B) in carrying out any authority provided under 
                subparagraph (A), act, in the same manner and to the 
                same extent, with respect to the Fund as the Federal 
                Deposit Insurance Corporation may act with respect to 
                the Deposit Insurance Fund under the provisions of the 
                Federal Deposit Insurance Act set forth in subparagraph 
                (A); and
                    (C) consistent with the authorities provided in 
                subparagraph (A), immediately place an insolvent market 
                participant or participating aggregator into 
                receivership.
            (2) Rule of construction.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), 
        if an insolvent participating aggregator is an insured 
        depository institution or an affiliate of an insured depository 
        institution, the Director shall recommend, in writing, to such 
        participating aggregator's appropriate Federal banking agency 
        or State banking regulator to resolve such participating 
        aggregator pursuant to section 11(c) of the Federal Deposit 
        Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(c)) and other appropriate 
        sections of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 
        et seq.) or appropriate Federal or State law, as applicable.
            (3) Least-cost resolution required.--The Director may not 
        exercise any authority under paragraph (1) with respect to any 
        market participant or any participating aggregator that is not 
        an insured depository institution or an affiliate of an insured 
        depository institution, unless--
                    (A) the Director determines that the exercise of 
                such authority is necessary to ensure proper and 
                continued functioning of the secondary mortgage market; 
                and
                    (B) the total amount of the expenditures by the 
                Director and obligations incurred by the Director in 
                connection with the exercise of any such authority with 
                respect to such market participant or participating 
                aggregator is the least costly to the Fund, consistent 
                with the least cost approach specified in the Federal 
                Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.), of all 
                possible methods for meeting Ginnie Mae's obligations 
                under this Act and expeditiously concluding its 
                resolution activities.

        administrative expenses of the receiver when satisfying 
        unsecured claims against a market participant or participating 
        aggregator, or the receiver therefor, that are proven to the 
        satisfaction of the receiver.

                 TITLE II--SECURITIZATION AND INSURANCE

SEC. 201. ISSUING PLATFORM.

    (a) Establishment.--
            (1) In general.--There is established within Ginnie Mae an 
        entity to be known as the Issuing Platform (the ``Platform''), 
        which shall issue standardized mortgage-backed securities to 
        increase homogeneity in the eligible securities market.
            (2) Authorities.--The Platform may--
                    (A) make contracts, incur liabilities, and borrow 
                money;
                    (B) purchase, sell, receive, hold, and use real and 
                personal property;
                    (C) create, execute, and administer trusts; and
                    (D) take such actions as the Platform determines 
                are necessary or incidental to carry out the Platform's 
                duties under this Act.
    (b) Delivery of Pool to the Platform.--A mortgage originator or 
aggregator that wishes to make use of the Platform and have Ginnie Mae 
insure the securities issued by the Platform shall deliver to the 
Platform a pool of eligible mortgage loans.
    (c) Securitization.--The Platform shall, upon receiving a pool of 
eligible mortgages--
            (1) create standardized mortgage-backed securities 
        collateralized by such mortgages; and
            (2) transfer the standardized mortgage-backed securities to 
        the mortgage originator or aggregator from which the Platform 
        received the pool of eligible mortgages that are 
        collateralizing the securities or the designee of such 
        originator or aggregator.
    (d) Standardized Criteria for Securities.--In issuing securities 
under this section, the Platform shall establish standardized criteria 
for such securities, including--
            (1) uniform loan delivery, servicing, and pooling 
        requirements;
            (2) remittance requirements;
            (3) underwriting guidelines and refinance programs;
            (4) the credit quality of the guarantee provided to each 
        security;
            (5) servicing standards and loan repurchase policies;
            (6) disclosure policies;
            (7) security terms and features; and
            (8) standards for the appropriate minimum level of 
        diversification for the mortgage loans that collateralize such 
        securities, in order to reduce the credit risk such securities 
        could pose to the Fund.
    (e) Securitization Fee.--The Platform shall charge a fee for 
securitization services provided under this section. Such fee shall be 
set by the Director and shall be in an amount sufficient to offset the 
costs to the Platform of carrying out this section.
    (f) Loan Limits; Housing Price Index.--
            (1) Establishment.--Ginnie Mae shall establish limitations 
        governing the maximum original principal obligation of eligible 
        mortgage loans that may collateralize a security issued under 
        this Act.
            (2) Calculation of amount.--The limitation set forth under 
        paragraph (1) shall be calculated with respect to the total 
        original principal obligation of the eligible mortgage loan and 
        not merely with respect to the amount insured by Ginnie Mae.
            (3) Maximum limits.--
                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), the maximum limitation amount under this paragraph 
                shall not exceed $417,000 for a mortgage loan secured 
                by a 1-family residence, for a mortgage loan secured by 
                a 2-family residence the limit shall equal 128 percent 
                of the limit for a mortgage loan secured by a 1-family 
                residence, for a mortgage loan secured by a 3-family 
                residence the limit shall equal 155 percent of the 
                limit for a mortgage loan secured by a 1-family 
                residence, and for a mortgage loan secured by a 4-
                family residence the limit shall equal 192 percent of 
                the limit for a mortgage loan secured by a 1-family 
                residence, except that such maximum limitations shall 
                be adjusted effective January 1 of each year beginning 
                after the effective date of this Act, subject to the 
                limitations in this subsection. Each adjustment shall 
                be made by adding to each such amount (as it may have 
                been previously adjusted) a percentage thereof equal to 
                the percentage increase, during the most recent 12-
                month or 4-quarter period ending before the time of 
                determining such annual adjustment, in the housing 
                price index maintained by Ginnie Mae pursuant to 
                paragraph (4). If the change in such house price index 
                during the most recent 12-month or 4-quarter period 
                ending before the time of determining such annual 
                adjustment is a decrease, then no adjustment shall be 
                made for the next year, and the next upward adjustment 
                shall take into account prior declines in the house 
                price index, so that any adjustment shall reflect the 
                net change in the house price index since the last 
                adjustment. Declines in the house price index shall be 
                accumulated and then reduce increases until subsequent 
                increases exceed prior declines.
                    (B) High-cost area limits.--The limitations set 
                forth in subparagraph (A) may be increased by not more 
                than 50 percent with respect to properties located in 
                Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands. Such 
                foregoing limitations shall also be increased, with 
                respect to properties of a particular size located in 
                any area for which 115 percent of the median house 
                price for such size residence exceeds the limitation 
                for such size residence set forth under subparagraph 
                (A), to the lesser of 150 percent of such limitation 
                for such size residence or the amount that is equal to 
                115 percent of the median house price in such area for 
                such size residence.
            (4) Housing price index.--
                    (A) National index.--Ginnie Mae shall establish and 
                maintain a method of assessing a national average 
                single-family house price for use in calculating the 
                loan limits for single-family mortgage loans under 
                paragraph (3), and other averages as Ginnie Mae 
                considers appropriate, including--
                            (i) averages based on different geographic 
                        regions; and
                            (ii) an average for houses whose mortgage 
                        collateralized single-family covered 
                        securities.
                    (B) Considerations.--In establishing the method 
                described under subparagraph (A), Ginnie Mae may take 
                into consideration such data, including existing house 
                price indexes, and other measures as Ginnie Mae 
                considers appropriate.
    (g) Authority for Loan-Level Enhancement.--With respect to an 
eligible mortgage loan that is or will be contained in a pool of 
mortgages delivered to the Platform, the mortgage originator of such 
mortgage loan may enter into agreements with market participants to 
provide loan-level enhancement of such mortgage loan.
    (h) Certification.--Ginnie Mae shall, upon a determination that the 
Platform is able to efficiently carry out the issuance of standardized 
mortgage-backed securities and that there exists a sufficient number of 
market participants to serve as insurers and reinsurers under section 
202, certify to the Congress that such determination has been made.
    (i) Duty To Serve All Markets.--
            (1) In general.--In carrying out its responsibilities under 
        this title, Ginnie Mae shall facilitate the broad availability 
        of mortgage credit and secondary mortgage market financing 
        through fluctuations in the business cycle for single-family 
        and multifamily lending across all--
                    (A) regions;
                    (B) localities;
                    (C) institutions;
                    (D) property types, including housing serving 
                renters; and
                    (E) borrowers.
            (2) Report to congress.--Ginnie Mae shall issue a 
        semiannual report to the Congress on--
                    (A) how Ginnie Mae is carrying out the duties 
                required under paragraph (1); and
                    (B) the extent to which the provisions of this 
                title and the programs carried out pursuant to this 
                title are benefitting underserved communities.
    (j) Exemption From SEC Laws and Regulations.--Standardized 
mortgage-backed securities issued by the Platform shall be exempt from 
the Federal securities laws (as defined under section 3(a) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and all regulations issued pursuant to 
such laws.

program to establish, Ginnie Mae shall determine which program is the

                        agree to offer retrocessional reinsurance to 
                        reinsure up to 90 percent of the 95 percent

                        basis.
            (2) Guarantor program.--A Guarantor Program, which shall 
        include the following:
                    (A) First loss requirement.--The mortgage

                securitization shall, prior to delivering such pool, 
                contract directly with a market participant to insure 
                the first 5 percent of loss on all securities issued by 
                the Platform that are securitized by such pool of 
                eligible mortgage loans.

                            (i) In general.--If Ginnie Mae determines 
                        that it would be an efficient way to operate 
                        the insurance requirements under this Act and 
                        would encourage the incorporation of private

                        originators and aggregators described under 
                        subparagraph (A) to select the market

                        aggregator, as described under clause (i)--
                                    (I) such market participants shall 
                                be required to meet the same standards 
                                as a market participant selected by 
                                Ginnie Mae; and
                                    (II) for purposes of determining 
                                the insurance fee described under 
                                subsection (d), Ginnie Mae shall 
                                contract with a private sector insurer 
                                to estimate the risk that the market 
                                participant may default.
    (c) Additional Program Requirements.--
            (1) Competitive bidding process.--Ginnie Mae shall use a 
        competitive bidding process to determine which market 
        participants should be granted contracts under subsection 
        (b)(1) and, except as provided under subsection (b)(2)(C), 
        under subsection (b)(2)(B).
            (2) Use of insurance broker.--With respect to any market 
        participant that Ginnie Mae selects under a risk sharing 
        program, Ginnie Mae shall select an insurance broker, through a 
        competitive bidding process, that will solicit bids, on behalf 
        of Ginnie Mae, for the reinsurance contracts under such 
        program.
            (3) Ceding commission.--As part of a retrocession contract 
        under subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) or subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii), the 
        market participants shall be paid a competitively determined 
        ceding commission for the underwriting and administrative costs 
        of providing such reinsurance.
            (4) Phase-in.--Ginnie Mae may, if it determines it 
        appropriate--
                    (A) phase-in the 5 percent requirements under 
                subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(2)(A), by originally 
                requiring a lower percentage; and

                originally requiring a higher percentage.
    (d) Insurance Fee and Terms.--
            (1) Pre-pricing of insurance fee.--Ginnie Mae shall set the 
        insurance fee applicable to securities issued by the Platform 
        in advance on a quarter-by-quarter basis, through forward

                aggregators that originated or aggregated the mortgage 
                loans included in the pool of eligible mortgage loans 
                backing the security being insured, but in making such 
                adjustments, Ginnie Mae shall ensure that the weighted 
                average of the entire book of business matches the 
                ultimate price determination.

        market participant that contracts with Ginnie Mae pursuant to

                interests of any particular class of investors. A 
                trustee that is deemed to be acting in accordance with 
                its fiduciary duty to the trust shall not be liable to 
                any investor, and shall not be subject to any

                automatically be deemed to include a trustee's 
                fiduciary duty. The trustee's fiduciary duty may not be 
                abrogated or altered by the parties to such documents 
                and may not be amended by parties to contracts for 
                private label securities.
                    (D) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed to relieve any party of 
                its duties to participants and beneficiaries of any 
                employee benefit plan under the Employee Retirement 
                Income Security Act (29 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).
                    (E) Conflicts with the trust indenture act of 
                1939.--To the extent that the provisions of this 
                paragraph conflict with any provision of the Trust 
                Indenture Act of 1939, the provisions of the Trust 
                Indenture Act of 1939 shall apply, but only to the 
                extent of the conflict.

                of enactment of this Act, Ginnie Mae shall--

                                    (II) any changes to such 
                                compensation attributable io the

                                of such fiduciary duty on liquidity in

                        effects of the imposition of the fiduciary duty 
                        required under this paragraph upon borrowers, 
                        including if the imposition of' such fiduciary 
                        duty results in additional costs and expenses 
                        to borrowers; and
                            (iv) not later than 1 year after the

SEC. 403. APPROVAL AND SUPERVISION OF MULTIFAMILY GUARANTORS.

    (a) In General.--The Director shall develop, adopt, publish, and 
enforce standards for the approval by the Director of multifamily 
guarantors to--
            (1) issue securities collateralized by eligible multifamily 
        mortgage loans; and
            (2) guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest 
        on such securities collateralized by eligible multifamily 
        mortgage loans and insured by Ginnie Mae.
    (b) Required Standards.--The standards required under paragraph (1) 
shall include standards sufficient to ensure that--
            (1) each multifamily guarantor is well-capitalized; and
            (2) credit risk-sharing levels under any such guarantees 
        are commensurate with such levels under the Delegated 
        Underwriting and Servicing Lender Program of the Federal 
        National Mortgage Association and the Capital Market Execution 
        Program Series K Structured 2Pass-Through Certificates 
        originated and offered under the Program Plus Lender Program of 
        the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
    (c) Pricing.--Ginnie Mae shall charge a guarantee fee for 
guarantees provided pursuant to this section and such fee shall be 
determined by Ginnie Mae--
            (1) in the same manner and using the same procedures used 
        pursuant to title II to determine guarantee fees for securities 
        backed by single-family housing mortgages, with such changes as 
        Ginnie Mae determines to be necessary to account for the 
        differences between the single-family guarantee business and 
        the multifamily guarantee business; and
            (2) taking into account the differences between the 
        guarantee fees structures of the Federal National Mortgage 
        Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
    (d) Distinctions.--The Director shall take into account, in 
carrying out this section, in providing any issuing platform, and in 
establishing any requirements relating to the guarantee of securities 
collateralized by eligible multifamily mortgage loans, the particular 
nature and characteristics of such securities and loans, as 
distinguished from eligible mortgages and securities guaranteed 
pursuant to title II, and as may be necessary to accommodate the 
multifamily housing financing market.

SEC. 404. OTHER FORMS OF MULTIFAMILY RISK-SHARING.

    The Director may establish such other methods and manner of risk-
sharing and risk transfer relating eligible multifamily mortgage loans, 
in addition to the methods and manners authorized under this title, as 
may be appropriate taking into consideration the particular nature and 
characteristics of the multifamily housing finance market, which may 
include any risk-sharing activities of the Federal National Mortgage 
Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation relating to 
the multifamily housing business.
