Stand By Every Ad Act of 2014 - Amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to require the identification of funding and authorizing sources in communications expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate (as under current law) or which consist of the functional equivalent of express advocacy.

Prescribes special rules for express advocacy radio and television communications which are not authorized by a candidate, an authorized political committee of a candidate, or its agents. Requires individual disclosure statements about the head of the entity paying for the communication and about any other person that disbursed funds to the entity to finance the communication.

Requires disclosure of such identifying information within paid audio and video communications made through the Internet or e-mail.

Applies such disclosure requirements to prerecorded telephone calls.</summary>
