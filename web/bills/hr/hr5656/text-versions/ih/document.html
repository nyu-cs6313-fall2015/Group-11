_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize the Feed the Future Initiative to reduce global poverty 
  and hunger in developing countries on a sustainable basis, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Feed the Future Global Food Security 
Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) For more than 60 years, the United States has provided 
        consistent global leadership in addressing food security and 
        investing in agricultural development, research, innovation and 
        humanitarian assistance, particularly in Africa, Latin America 
        and South Asia.
            (2) Nevertheless, according to the January 2014 Worldwide 
        Threat Assessment of the United States Intelligence Community 
        report, ``lack of adequate food will be a destabilizing factor 
        in countries important to United States national security that 
        do not have the financial or technical abilities to solve their 
        internal food security problems,'' and ``food and nutrition 
        insecurity in weakly governed countries might also provide 
        opportunities for insurgent groups to capitalize on poor 
        conditions, exploit international food aid, and discredit 
        governments for their inability to address basic needs''.
            (3) According to the most recent estimates of the Food and 
        Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, globally more 
        than 805,000,000 people suffer from chronic hunger. In 
        addition, approximately 165,000,000 (or 1 in 4) children under 
        the age of 5 are stunted, with 80 percent of the world's 
        stunted children living in just 14 countries. Mounting evidence 
        from several peer-reviewed studies provide compelling evidence 
        that undernutrition during the critical first 1,000 day window 
        until age two leads to stunting, a lifelong condition of poor 
        health, impaired cognitive and physical development, and 
        diminished productivity.
            (4) The provision of folic acid as a supplement to women of 
        childbearing years has resulted in benefits, including a 
        reduction in incidents of autism in some populations.
            (5) The African Union Commission Cost of Hunger in Africa 
        study estimated that the economic costs associated with child 
        undernutrition are substantial--from 2 percent to 16 percent of 
        the gross national product (GNP) in several African nations. 
        For instance, this cost was estimated at $4,700,000,000 in 
        Ethiopia in 2009 alone, which is the equivalent of 16 percent 
        of Ethiopia's GNP.
            (6) The Feed the Future Initiative (FTF) is the United 
        States flagship global hunger and food security program. The 
        primary objectives of FTF are to improve food security by 
        increasing productivity and incomes as well as reducing hunger 
        and to improve nutrition among 140,000,000 of the world's 
        poorest people in 19 priority countries. Feed the Future 
        focuses on improving the lives of smallholder farmers, 
        especially women and children.
            (7) FTF leverages partnerships with a wide range of 
        stakeholders--including private voluntary organizations, 
        universities, faith-based groups, international and domestic 
        research organizations, community-based organizations and 
        cooperatives--harnesses new innovations and technologies, 
        builds local capacity and sustainability, links to the global 
        economy, and adheres to rigor, transparency and accountability.
            (8) Its whole-of-government approach to food security 
        brings together agriculture, economic growth, trade 
        facilitation, nutrition, development, and humanitarian programs 
        to achieve unprecedented results. For example, preliminary data 
        indicates child stunting rates in Ethiopia have declined at a 
        3.3 percent annual rate over the past 3 years, such that there 
        are currently 160,000 fewer stunted children in Ethiopia 
        despite population growth over this period.
            (9) In 2013, FTF reached more than 7,000,000 farmers and 
        other food producers resulting in the employment of new 
        technologies and management practices on more than 4,000,000 
        hectares of land. Also in 2013, the initiative reached more 
        than 12,500,000 children with high impact nutrition 
        interventions such as micronutrient supplementation improving 
        both health and development.
            (10) To increase responsible private agricultural 
        investment, private sector executives and African leaders 
        launched the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition (New 
        Alliance). Since 2012, the New Alliance has expanded from three 
        to ten African countries and approximately 180 African and 
        international companies have committed to investing over 
        $10,000,000,000 in African agriculture.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that United States efforts to end 
extreme global poverty should build upon the progress and successes of 
the Feed the Future Initiative in supporting agricultural development 
and addressing chronic hunger and malnutrition.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to reduce global poverty and hunger through a 
        comprehensive food security and nutrition strategy known as the 
        Feed the Future Initiative (FTF);
            (2) to implement FTF using a whole of government approach;
            (3) to promote agricultural development to help transform 
        local economies, increase political stability, and expand 
        trade;
            (4) to focus on country-led agricultural priorities in 
        partnership with local governments, donor organizations, 
        multilateral institutions, the private sector, civil society, 
        and international and university research institutions in the 
        United States;
            (5) to increase the productivity, incomes and livelihoods 
        of small-scale producers, especially women, by working across 
        agricultural value chains and expanding farmer access to local 
        and international markets;
            (6) to promote secure and transparent land rights in order 
        to enable responsible investment in agriculture;
            (7) to target research, develop new technologies, utilize 
        extension agents, and improve post-harvest storage in order to 
        reduce food waste;
            (8) to improve the nutrition of women and children, with a 
        focus on reducing child stunting;
            (9) to expand access to diverse and quality foods and 
        enhance nutrition-related behaviors that improve maternal and 
        child health; and
            (10) to increase the resilience of vulnerable communities 
        and households by building capacity in safety nets and 
        decreasing the need for emergency assistance.
