SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Food Security Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY OBJECTIVES; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Statement of Policy Objectives.--It is in the national security 
interest of the United States to promote global food security and 
nutrition, consistent with national food security investment plans, 
which is reinforced through programs, activities, and initiatives 
that--
            (1) accelerate inclusive, agricultural-led economic growth 
        that reduces global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, 
        particularly among women and children;
            (2) increase the productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of 
        small-scale producers, especially women, by working across 
        agricultural value chains and expanding producer access to 
        local and international markets;
            (3) build resilience to food shocks among vulnerable 
        populations and households while reducing reliance upon 
        emergency food assistance;
            (4) create an enabling environment for agricultural growth 
        and investment, including through the promotion of secure and 
        transparent property rights;
            (5) improve the nutritional status of women and children, 
        with a focus on reducing child stunting, including through the 
        promotion of highly nutritious foods, diet diversification, and 
        nutritional behaviors that improve maternal and child health;
            (6) align with and leverage broader United States 
        investments in trade, economic growth, science and technology, 
        maternal and child health, and water, sanitation, and hygiene; 
        and
            (7) ensure the effective use of United States taxpayer 
        dollars to further these objectives.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
President, in providing assistance to implement the Global Food 
Security Strategy, should--
            (1) coordinate, through a whole-of-government approach, the 
        efforts of relevant Federal departments and agencies to 
        implement the Global Food Security Strategy;
            (2) utilize, to the extent possible, open and streamlined 
        solicitations to allow for the participation of a wide range of 
        implementing partners via the most appropriate contracting 
        mechanism; and
            (3) continue to strengthen existing partnerships between 
        developing country institutions of agricultural sciences with 
        universities in the United States, with a focus on building the 
        capacities of developing nation universities in agriculture.
