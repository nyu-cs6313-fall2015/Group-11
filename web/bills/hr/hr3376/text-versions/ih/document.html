 To provide a 12-month exemption from the health insurance mandate for 
individuals whose employer-sponsored health plan coverage or individual 
   health insurance coverage is terminated for a plan year beginning 
                  during 2014, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness for Lost Coverage Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. 12-MONTH EXEMPTION FROM ACA MANDATE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO LOSE 
              HEALTH PLAN OR INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE PLAN YEAR 
              BEGINNING DURING 2014.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the 
case of an applicable individual (as defined in subsection (b)), none 
of the 12 months beginning with the first month of the loss of coverage 
described in subsection (b)(2) shall be taken into account in applying 
section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    (b) Applicable Individual Defined.--In subsection (a), the term 
``applicable individual'' means an individual who--
            (1) has coverage (whether as a principal or dependent of 
        another individual) under an employer-sponsored health plan or 
        individual health insurance coverage for the last month of a 
        plan year beginning during 2013; and
            (2) loses such coverage beginning with the first month of 
        the subsequent plan year because of the termination of such 
        plan or insurance coverage and not because of the termination 
        or change of employment of the individual or the individual's 
        failure to pay premiums or other reasons within the control of 
        the individual.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
