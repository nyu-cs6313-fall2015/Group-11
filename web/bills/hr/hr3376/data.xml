  <summary>10/29/2013--Introduced.
Fairness for Lost Coverage Act of 2013 - Prohibits any of the 12 months beginning with the first month of an applicable individual's loss of health insurance coverage from being taken into account in applying the Internal Revenue Code requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.

Defines "applicable individual" as an individual who: (1) has coverage (whether as a principal or a dependent of another individual) under an employer-sponsored health plan or individual health insurance coverage for the last month of a plan year beginning during 2013, and (2) loses such coverage beginning with the first month of the subsequent plan year because of the plan's or coverage's termination and not because of any termination or change of the individual's employment, the individual's failure to pay premiums, or any other reasons within the individual's control.</summary>
