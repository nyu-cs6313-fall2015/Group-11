Coordinated Assistance To Catch Human Traffickers Act of 2014 or the CATCH Traffickers Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish and maintain a database to serve as a central location for information from law enforcement agency investigations relating to human trafficking.

Requires: (1) the head of a law enforcement agency conducting such an investigation to ensure that information the Secretary determines to be appropriate is entered into the database; and (2) the Attorney General to reduce by 20% the amount of a grant under Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program received by a state or local government the law enforcement agency of which does not substantially comply with such requirement.

Permits law enforcement agencies to access the database only in connection with an investigation related to human trafficking.</summary>
