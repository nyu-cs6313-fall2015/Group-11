SECTION 1. REAFFIRMATION OF AUTHORITY.

    (a) Modification.--
            (1) In general.--The first sentence of section 19 of the 
        Act of June 18, 1934 (commonly known as the ``Indian 
        Reorganization Act''; 25 U.S.C. 479), is amended--
                    (A) by striking ``The term'' and inserting 
                ``Effective beginning on June 18, 1934, the term''; and
                    (B) by striking ``any recognized Indian tribe now 
                under Federal jurisdiction'' and inserting ``any 
                federally recognized Indian tribe''.
            (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) 
        shall take effect as if included in the Act of June 18, 1934 
        (commonly known as the ``Indian Reorganization Act''; 25 U.S.C. 
        479), on the date of the enactment of that Act.
    (b) Ratification and Confirmation of Actions.--Any action taken by 
the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act of June 18, 1934 
(commonly known as the ``Indian Reorganization Act''; 25 U.S.C. 461 et 
seq.), for any Indian tribe that was federally recognized on that date 
of the action is ratified and confirmed, to the extent such action is 
subjected to challenge based on whether the Indian tribe was federally 
recognized or under Federal jurisdiction on June 18, 1934, ratified and 
confirmed as fully to all intents and purposes as if the action had, by 
prior Act of Congress, been specifically authorized and directed.
    (c) Effect on Other Laws.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in this section or the amendments 
        made by this section shall affect--
                    (A) the application or effect of any Federal law 
                other than the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et 
                seq.), as amended by subsection (a) of this section; or
                    (B) any limitation on the authority of the 
                Secretary of the Interior under any Federal law or 
                regulation other than the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 
                U.S.C. 461 et seq.), as so amended.

        other Federal law shall be considered to be a reference to that 
        Act as amended by subsection (a) of this Act.
