                                 A BILL


 
 To provide for research and education with respect to triple-negative 
                 breast cancer, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Triple-Negative Breast Cancer 
Research and Education Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Breast cancer accounts for 1 in 4 cancer diagnoses 
        among women in this country.
            (2) The survival rate for breast cancer has increased to 90 
        percent for White women and 78 percent for African-American 
        women.
            (3) African-American women are more likely to be diagnosed 
        with larger tumors and more advanced stages of breast cancer 
        despite a lower incidence rate.
            (4) Early detection for breast cancer increases survival 
        rates for breast cancer, as evidenced by a 5-year relative 
        survival rate of 98 percent for breast cancers that are 
        discovered before the cancer spreads beyond the breast, 
        compared to 23 percent for stage IV breast cancers.
            (5) Triple-negative breast cancer is a term used to 
        describe breast cancers whose cells do not have estrogen 
        receptors and progesterone receptors, and do not have an excess 
        of the HER2 protein on their sources.
            (6) It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of 
        female breast cancer patients are diagnosed with triple-
        negative breast cancer, and studies indicate the prevalence of 
        triple-negative breast cancer is much higher.
            (7) Triple-negative breast cancer most commonly affects 
        African-American women, followed by Hispanic women.
            (8) Triple-negative breast cancer is a very aggressive form 
        of cancer which affects women under the age of 50 across all 
        racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.
            (9) African-American women are 3 times more likely to 
        develop triple-negative breast cancer than White women.
            (10) Triple-negative breast cancer tends to grow and spread 
        more quickly than most other types of breast cancer.
            (11) Like other forms of breast cancer, triple-negative 
        breast cancer is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or 
        chemotherapy.
            (12) Early-stage detection of triple-negative breast cancer 
        is the key to survival because the tumor cells lack certain 
        receptors, and neither hormone therapy nor drugs that target 
        these receptors are effective against these cancers; therefore, 
        early detection and education is vital.
            (13) Current research and available data do not provide 
        adequate information on--
                    (A) the rates of prevalence and incidence of 
                triple-negative breast cancer in African-American, 
                Hispanic, and other minority women;
                    (B) he costs associated with treating triple-
                negative breast cancer; and
                    (C) the methods by which triple-negative breast 
                cancer may be prevented or cured in these women.

SEC. 3. RESEARCH WITH RESPECT TO TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER.

    (a) Research.--The Director of the National Institutes of Health 
(in this section referred to as the ``Director of NIH'') shall expand, 
intensify, and coordinate programs for the conduct and support of 
research with respect to triple-negative breast cancer.
    (b) Administration.--The Director of NIH shall carry out this 
section through the appropriate institutes, offices, and centers of the 
National Institutes of Health, including the Eunice Kennedy Shriver 
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the Office of Research on 
Women's Health, and the National Institute on Minority Health and 
Health Disparities.
    (c) Coordination of Activities.--The Director of the Office of 
Research on Women's Health shall coordinate activities under this 
section among the institutes, offices, and centers of the National 
Institutes of Health.

each of the fiscal years 2014 through 2016.

SEC. 4. EDUCATION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO 
              TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER.

    (a) Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Public Education Program.--The 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall develop and 
disseminate to the public information regarding triple-negative breast 
cancer, including information on--
            (1) the incidence and prevalence of triple-negative breast 
        cancer among women;
            (2) the elevated risk for minority women to develop triple-
        negative breast cancer; and
            (3) the availability, as medically appropriate, of a range 
        of treatment options for symptomatic triple-negative breast 
        cancer.
    (b) Dissemination of Information.--The Secretary may disseminate 
information under subsection (a) directly or through arrangements with 
nonprofit organizations, consumer groups, institutions of higher 
education, Federal, State, or local agencies, or the media.
    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying 
out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as 
may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2014 through 2016.

SEC. 5. INFORMATION TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WITH RESPECT TO TRIPLE-
              NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER.

    (a) Dissemination of Information.--The Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, acting through the Administrator of the Health 
Resources and Services Administration, shall develop and disseminate to 
health care providers information on triple-negative breast cancer for 
the purpose of ensuring that health care providers remain informed 
about current information on triple-negative breast cancer. Such 
information shall include the elevated risk for minority women to 
develop triple-negative breast cancer and the range of available 
options for the treatment of symptomatic triple-negative breast cancer.
    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying 
out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as
