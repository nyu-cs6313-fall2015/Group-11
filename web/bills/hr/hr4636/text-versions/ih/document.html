(other than legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to 
meet the additional requirements imposed by this Act, the State plan 
shall not be regarded as failing to comply with the requirements of 
such section solely on the basis of the failure of the plan to meet

quarter beginning after the close of the 1st regular session of the 
State legislature that ends after the 1-year period beginning with the 
date of the enactment of this Act. For purposes of the preceding

the State legislature.
