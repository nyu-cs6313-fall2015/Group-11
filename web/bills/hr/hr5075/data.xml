Requires the affected landowner to be given the right of first refusal to purchase the land for fair market value minus the value of any significant improvements made to such lands, or be reimbursed for the fair market value of any such improvements made to such lands. Prohibits the landowner from being charged with willful trespass onto the land unless the person used such lands with the knowledge that they should be classified as federal land.</summary>
