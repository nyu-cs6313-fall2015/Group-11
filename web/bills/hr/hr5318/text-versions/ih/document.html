    (a) Non-Transplant Tissue Bank License.--
            (1) Prohibition.--No person may introduce or deliver for 
        introduction into interstate commerce any human tissue specimen 
        for medical research or education unless--
                    (A) a tissue bank license is in effect for the

                interstate commerce;
                    (B) each package of the human tissue specimen is--
                            (i) labeled with the proper name of the

                tissue bank licenses.
                    (B) Approval.--The Secretary shall approve a non-
                transplant tissue bank license application--
                            (i) on the basis of a demonstration that--

                                communicable disease agents, properly 
                                labeled, transported, stored and used 
                                according to the donor's donation

                                meets standards designed to assure that 
                                the human tissue specimen does not pose 
                                a communicable disease risk to the 
                                general public and/or unknown 
                                communicable disease risk to; and

                        application, in accordance with subsection (c) 
                        of this section.
            (3) Requirements for exemption.--The Secretary shall

        preparation of any human tissue.
    (d) Recall of Specimen Presenting Imminent Hazard; Violations.--
            (1) Recall.--Upon a determination that a human tissue 
        specimen or collection of specimens licensed under this section 
        presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public 
        health, the Secretary shall issue an order immediately ordering 
        the recall of such batch, lot, or other quantity of such 
        product. An order under this paragraph shall be issued in 
        accordance with section 554 of title 5.
            (2) Violations.--Any violation of paragraph (1) shall

        paragraph shall, effective December 1 of each year beginning 1 
        year after the effective date of this paragraph, be increased 
        by the percent change in the Consumer Price Index for the base 
        quarter of such year over the Consumer Price Index for the base 
        quarter of the preceding year, adjusted to the nearest \1/10\ 
        of 1 percent. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``base 
        quarter'', as used with respect to a year, means the calendar 
        quarter ending on September 30 of such year and the price index 
        for a base quarter is the arithmetical mean of such index for 
        the 3 months comprising such quarter.

    (f) Construction With Other Laws.--Nothing contained in this Act 
shall be construed as in any way affecting, modifying, repealing, or 
superseding under any existing provisions under current Federal law.
    (g) Human Tissue Specimen Defined.--In this section, the term 
``non-transplant tissue specimen'' means legally donated anatomical 
segments, cells, collection of cells, bodily fluids, or the complete 
body that are recovered for medical research and education. The term 
does not include anything that would qualify as a biological product 
under the Public Health Service Act.
