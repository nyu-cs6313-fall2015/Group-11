SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON USE OF SOCIAL COST OF CARBON IN ANALYSIS.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any

order to incorporate any social benefits of reducing carbon dioxide 
emissions in any regulatory impact analysis unless and until a Federal 
law is enacted authorizing such use.
    (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``social cost of 
carbon'' means the social cost of carbon as described in the technical 
support document entitled ``Technical Support Document: Technical 
Update of the Social Cost of Carbon for Regulatory Impact Analysis 
Under Executive Order 12866'', published by the Interagency Working 
Group on Social Cost of Carbon, United States Government, in May 2013, 
or any successor or substantially related document, or any other 
estimate of the monetized damages associated with an incremental 
increase in carbon dioxide emissions in a given year.
