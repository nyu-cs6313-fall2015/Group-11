 To reduce the annual rate of compensation of Members of Congress by a 
percentage equal to the effective reduction in the average annual rate 
 of pay of Federal employees who were subject to sequestration-related 
           furloughs during the two most recent fiscal years.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sequestration Tied to Member Pay 
(STOMP) Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. EQUIVALENT REDUCTION IN PAY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IF FEDERAL 
              EMPLOYEE PAY IS REDUCED BY REASON OF SEQUESTRATION.

    (a) Reduction in Pay.--Section 601(a) of the Legislative 
Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``The annual rate'' and 
        inserting ``Subject to paragraph (3), the annual rate''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(3)(A) If, during either of the two most recent fiscal years 
ending before a Congress, the effective annual rate of pay of employees 
of the Federal Government is reduced as a result of a sequestration-
related furlough, the annual rate of pay otherwise applicable under 
paragraph (1) during the Congress shall be reduced by a percentage 
equal to the average percentage reduction in such effective annual rate 
of pay during those 2 fiscal years for all employees of the Federal 
Government whose pay was reduced as a result of such a furlough.
    ``(B) Not later than December 15 of each even-numbered year, the 
Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall determine and 
publish the percentage (if any) by which the annual rate of pay 
otherwise applicable under paragraph (1) shall be reduced during the 
next Congress pursuant to this paragraph.
    ``(C) In this paragraph, the term `employees of the Federal 
Government' means employees described in section 2105 of title 5, 
United States Code.
    ``(D) In this paragraph, the term `sequestration-related furlough' 
means, with respect to an employee of the Federal Government, the 
placing of the employee in a temporary status without duties and pay 
because of a lack of funds which results from--
            ``(i) any reduction made with respect to a fiscal year 
        pursuant to a sequestration order issued under section 254 of 
        the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 
        (or, in the case of fiscal year 2013, under section 251A of 
        such Act); or
            ``(ii) the imposition with respect to a fiscal year of the 
        discretionary spending limits set forth in section 251(c) of 
        such Act (as modified by section 251A of such Act).''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to the One Hundred Fourteenth Congress and each 
succeeding Congress.
