     To amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, to more 
 comprehensively address the interstate transportation of firearms or 
                              ammunition.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION.

    (a) In General.--Section 926A of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:
``Sec. 926A. Interstate transportation of firearms or ammunition
    ``(a) Notwithstanding any provision of any law, rule, or regulation 
of a State or any political subdivision thereof:
            ``(1) A person who is not prohibited by this chapter from 
        possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm or 
        ammunition shall be entitled to transport a firearm for any 
        lawful purpose from any place where the person may lawfully 
        possess, carry, or transport the firearm to any other such 
        place if, during the transportation, the firearm is unloaded, 
        and--
                    ``(A) if the transportation is by motor vehicle, 
                the firearm is not directly accessible from the 
                passenger compartment of the vehicle, and, if the 
                vehicle is without a compartment separate from the 
                passenger compartment, the firearm is in a locked 
                container other than the glove compartment or console, 
                or is secured by a secure gun storage or safety device; 
                or
                    ``(B) if the transportation is by other means, the 
                firearm is in a locked container or secured by a secure 
                gun storage or safety device.
            ``(2) A person who is not prohibited by this chapter from 
        possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm or 
        ammunition shall be entitled to transport ammunition for any 
        lawful purpose from any place where the person may lawfully 
        possess, carry, or transport the ammunition, to any other such 
        place if, during the transportation, the ammunition is not 
        loaded into a firearm, and--
                    ``(A) if the transportation is by motor vehicle, 
                the ammunition is not directly accessible from the 
                passenger compartment of the vehicle, and, if the 
                vehicle is without a compartment separate from the 
                passenger compartment, the ammunition is in a locked 
                container other than the glove compartment or console; 
                or
                    ``(B) if the transportation is by other means, the 
                ammunition is in a locked container.
    ``(b) In subsection (a), the term `transport' includes staying in 
temporary lodging overnight, stopping for food, fuel, vehicle 
maintenance, an emergency, medical treatment, and any other activity 
incidental to the transport, but does not include transportation--
            ``(1) with the intent to commit a crime punishable by 
        imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that involves the 
        use or threatened use of force against another; or
            ``(2) with knowledge, or reasonable cause to believe, that 
        such a crime is to be committed in the course of, or arising 
        from, the transportation.
    ``(c)(1) A person who is transporting a firearm or ammunition may 
not be arrested or otherwise detained for violation of any law or any 
rule or regulation of a State or any political subdivision thereof 
related to the possession, transportation, or carrying of firearms, 
unless there is probable cause to believe that the person is doing so 
in a manner not provided for in subsection (a).
    ``(2) When a person asserts this section as a defense in a criminal 
proceeding, the prosecution shall bear the burden of proving, beyond a 
reasonable doubt, that the conduct of the person did not satisfy the 
conditions set forth in subsection (a).
    ``(3) When a person successfully asserts this section as a defense 
in a criminal proceeding, the court shall award the prevailing 
defendant a reasonable attorney's fee.
    ``(d)(1) A person who is deprived of any right, privilege, or 
immunity secured by this section, section 926B or 926C, under color of 
any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State or 
any political subdivision thereof, may bring an action in any 
appropriate court against any other person, including a State or 
political subdivision thereof, who causes the person to be subject to 
the deprivation, for damages and other appropriate relief.
    ``(2) The court shall award a plaintiff prevailing in an action 
brought under paragraph (1) damages and such other relief as the court 
deems appropriate, including a reasonable attorney's fee.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for such chapter is 
amended in the item relating to section 926A by striking ``firearms'' 
and inserting ``firearms or ammunition''.
