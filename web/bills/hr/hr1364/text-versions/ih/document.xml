				shall allocate credits to fleets that repower or convert an existing vehicle so
				that it is capable of operating on an alternative fuel. In the case of any
				medium-duty or heavy-duty vehicle that is repowered or converted, the Secretary
				shall allocate additional credits for such vehicles if the Secretary determines
				that such vehicles displace more petroleum than light-duty alternative fueled
				vehicles. The Secretary shall include a requirement that such vehicles remain
				in the fleet for a period of no less than 2 years in order to continue to
				qualify for credit. The Secretary also shall extend the flexibility afforded in
				this section to Federal fleets subject to the purchase provisions contained in
				section 303 of this
