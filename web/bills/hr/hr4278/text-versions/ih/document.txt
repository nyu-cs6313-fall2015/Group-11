                     TITLE I--ASSISTANCE PROVISIONS

SEC. 101. SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE AND CIVIL SOCIETY IN 
              UKRAINE.

    (a) In General.--The President is authorized and encouraged to 
provide assistance to support democracy and civil society in Ukraine by 
undertaking the activities described in subsection (b).
    (b) Activities Described.--The activities described in this 
subsection are--
            (1) improving democratic governance, transparency, 
        accountability, rule of law, and anti-corruption efforts;
            (2) supporting Ukrainian efforts to foster greater unity 
        among people and regions of the country, combat anti-Semitism 
        and promote respect for religious freedom;
            (3) supporting the people and Government of Ukraine in 
        preparing to conduct and participate in free and fair 
        elections, including through domestic and international 
        election monitoring;
            (4) assisting Ukraine in diversifying its economy, trade, 
        and energy supplies, including at the national, regional, and 
        local levels;
            (5) strengthening democratic institutions and political and 
        civil society organizations; and
            (6) expanding free and unfettered access to independent 
        media of all kinds in Ukraine and assisting with the protection 
        of journalists and civil society activists who have been 
        targeted for free speech activities.
    (c) Availability of Funds.--Of amounts made available to carry out 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) for fiscal 
year 2014, $50,000,000 is authorized to be appropriated to carry out 
this section.

SEC. 102. ECONOMIC REFORM IN UKRAINE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Ukrainian economy is weak and vulnerable, as 
        evidenced by short-term debt interest rates as high as 15 
        percent, a high proportion of foreign exchange-denominated 
        government debt that will mature in 2014 and 2015, a banking 
        sector with non-performing loans at the high level of 14 
        percent, a financing gap which the Government of Ukraine has 
        estimated will amount to $35 billion over the next two years, 
        and a large underground economy. This economic condition 
        undermines democratic prospects in Ukraine.
            (2) Years of poor economic management and performance have 
        undermined and may continue to undermine political stability 
        and unity within Ukraine.
            (3) On March 6, 2014, the House of Representatives passed 
        H.R. 4152, to redirect previously appropriated funds to cover 
        the cost of roughly $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to work with other countries and international institutions to 
stabilize the Ukrainian economy, while promoting critically needed 
structural economic reforms in Ukraine, including--
            (1) cutting the massive natural gas subsidies that have led 
        to market inefficiencies;
            (2) reducing the bloated public sector;
            (3) maintaining a market-determined exchange rate;
            (4) strengthening the vulnerable banking sector; and
            (5) reducing corruption.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that loan 
guarantees provided by the United States for Ukraine should be used to 
promote government, banking and energy sector reform, and anti-
corruption efforts in Ukraine.

SEC. 103. UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMING TO UKRAINE AND 
              NEIGHBORING REGIONS.

    (a) Findings and Declarations.--Congress finds and declares the 
following:
            (1) The Russian Government has deliberately blocked the 
        Ukrainian people's access to uncensored sources of information 
        and has provided alternative news and information that is both 
        inaccurate and inflammatory.
            (2) United States international programming exists to 
        advance the United States interests and values by presenting 
        accurate and comprehensive news and information, which is the 
        foundation for democratic governance.
            (3) The opinions and views of the Ukrainian people, 
        especially those people located in the eastern regions and 
        Crimea, are not being accurately represented in Russian 
        dominated mass media.
            (4) Russian forces have seized more than five television 
        stations in Crimea and taken over transmissions, switching to a 
        24/7 Russian propaganda format; this increase in programming 
        augments the already robust pro-Russian programming to Ukraine.
            (5) United States international programming has the 
        potential to combat this anti-democratic propaganda.
    (b) Programming.--Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), 
Incorporated, and the Voice of America service to Ukraine and 
neighboring regions shall--
            (1) provide news and information that is accessible, 
        credible, and accurate;
            (2) emphasize investigative and analytical journalism to 
        highlight inconsistencies and misinformation provided by 
        Russian or pro-Russian media outlets;
            (3) prioritize programming to areas where access to 
        uncensored sources of information is limited or non-existent, 
        especially populations serviced by Russian supported media 
        outlets;
            (4) increase the number of reporters and organizational 
        presence in eastern Ukraine, especially in Crimea;
            (5) promote democratic processes, respect for human rights, 
        freedom of the press, and territorial sovereignty; and
            (6) take necessary preparatory steps to continue and 
        increase programming and content services to Russia.
    (c) Programming Surge.--RFE/RL, Incorporated, and Voice of America 
programming to Ukraine and neighboring regions shall--
            (1) prioritize programming to eastern Ukraine, including 
        Crimea, and to ethnic and linguistic Russian populations, as 
        well as Tatar minorities;
            (2) prioritize news and information that directly 
        contributes to the target audiences' understanding of political 
        and economic developments in Ukraine, including countering 
        misinformation that may originate from other news outlets, 
        especially Russian supported news outlets;
            (3) provide programming content 24 hours a day, seven days 
        a week to target populations, using all available and effective 
        distribution outlets, including--
                    (A) at least 8 weekly hours of total original 
                television and video content in Ukrainian, Russian, and 
                Tatar languages, not inclusive of live video streaming 
                coverage of breaking news, to be distributed on 
                satellite, digital, and through regional television 
                affiliates by the Voice of America; and
                    (B) at least 14 weekly hours the total audio 
                content in Ukrainian, Russian, and Tatar languages to 
                be distributed on satellite, digital, and through 
                regional radio affiliates of RFE/RL, Incorporated;
            (4) expand the use, audience, and audience engagement of 
        mobile news and multimedia platforms by RFE/RL, Incorporated, 
        and the Voice of America, including through Internet-based 
        social networking platforms; and
            (5) partner with private sector broadcasters and affiliates 
        to seek and start co-production for new, original content, when 
        possible, to increase distribution.
    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--
            (1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated for 
        fiscal year 2014, in addition to funds otherwise made available 
        for such purposes, up to $10,000,000 to carry out programming 
        in the Ukrainian, Balkan, Russian, and Tatar language services 
        of RFE/RL, Incorporated, and the Voice of America, for the 
        purpose of bolstering existing United States programming to the 
        people of Ukraine and neighboring regions, and increasing 
        programming capacity and jamming circumvention technology to 
        overcome any disruptions to service.
            (2) Offset.--Section 102(a) of the Enhanced Partnership 
        with Pakistan Act of 2009 (22 U.S.C. 8412(a); Public Law 111-
        73; 123 Stat. 2068) is amended by striking ``$1,500,000,000'' 
        and inserting ``$1,490,000,000''.
    (e) Report.--Not later than 15 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall submit to the 
Committees on Foreign Affairs and Appropriations of the House of 
Representatives and the Committees on Foreign Relations and

broadcasts pursuant to subsections (a) and (b).

Corporation should prioritize investments in Ukraine.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to assist Ukraine to eliminate the human rights abuses

    (b) Availability of Funds.--Of amounts made available to carry out 
section 1207 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year

authorized to be appropriated to enhance United States efforts to 
assist Ukraine to strengthen law enforcement capabilities and maintain 
the rule of law.
    (c) Notification Requirement.--The congressional notification 
requirements contained in section 1207(l) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (22 U.S.C. 2151 note) shall 
apply to the initiation of activities under a program of assistance 
under subsection (b) to the same extent and in the same manner as such 
congressional notification requirements apply to the initiation of 
activities under a program of assistance section 1207(b) of such Act.

SEC. 106. ENHANCED SECURITY COOPERATION AMONG CENTRAL AND EASTERN 
              EUROPEAN NATO MEMBER STATES.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of State, in consultation with the 
heads of appropriate United States departments and agencies, shall seek 
to provide enhanced security cooperation with Central and Eastern 
European North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member states by 
undertaking the activities described in subsection (b).
    (b) Activities Described.--The activities described in this 
subsection are--
            (1) enhancing existing security cooperation, including 
        defense and military-to-military cooperation, among Central and

        and security services in Central and Eastern European NATO 
        member states.

SEC. 107. UNITED STATES-UKRAINE SECURITY ASSISTANCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) in fiscal year 2013 the United States provided Ukraine 
        with nearly $2,000,000 in assistance under chapter 5 of part II 
        of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2347 et seq.; 
        relating to International Military Education Training) and 
        nearly $7,000,000 in assistance under section 23 of the Arms 
        Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763; relating to the Foreign 
        Military Financing Program); and
            (2) Ukraine has been a longstanding member of NATO's 
        Partnership for Peace.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) United States assistance to Ukraine under chapter 5 of 
        part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and section 23 of 
        the Arms Export Control Act should continue;
            (2) consistent with section 506(a) of the Foreign 
        Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2318(a)), the President is 
        encouraged to draw down defense articles from the stocks of the 
        Department of Defense, in order to provide non-lethal 
        assistance, which could include communication equipment, 
        clothing, fuel and other forms of appropriate assistance, to 
        the Government of Ukraine; and
            (3) the Administration should expeditiously conclude its 
        current review of all security assistance to the Government of 
        Ukraine.

SEC. 108. RECOVERY OF ASSETS LINKED TO CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Administration should provide 
expedited assistance to the Government of Ukraine to identify, 
investigate, secure, and recover assets stolen from the Government of 
Ukraine or linked to acts of corruption by former President Viktor 
Yanukovych, members of his family, and other former or current 
Ukrainian government officials, and their accomplices in any 
jurisdiction through appropriate United States Government and 
multilateral programs, including the Department of Justice's 
Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, the Egmont Group, the Stolen 
Asset Recovery Initiative, the Camden Asset Recovery Inter-Agency 
Network, and the Asset Recovery Focal Point Initiative.

SEC. 109. EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Article 1 of the Agreement Establishing the European 
        Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) states that the 
        EBRD should support investments in countries that are committed 
        to and applying the principles of multiparty democracy, 
        pluralism, and market economics, and the EBRD has recognized 
        that Russian ``progress in the application of these principles 
        . . . has been uneven''.
            (2) Russia received 21 percent of the investments made by 
        the EBRD in 2013, which is more than any other country received 
        from the EBRD in that year, and has received an inordinate 
        ratio of investment from the EBRD since the 2006 Capital 
        Resources Review.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) should 
increase investments in Ukraine and cease new investments in the 
Russian Federation, and the United States Government should press the 
EBRD to support new investment in Ukraine and halt consideration of new 
investment in Russia.

                     TITLE II--SANCTIONS PROVISIONS

SEC. 201. CONTINUATION IN EFFECT OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE

SEC. 203. REPORT ON CERTAIN FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On February 26, 2014, the Department of the Treasury's 
        Financial Crimes Enforcement Network advised United States 
        financial institutions of their responsibility to take 
        reasonable, risk-based steps regarding the potential suspicious 
        movement of assets related to Viktor Yanukovych departing Kyiv 
        and abdicating his responsibilities and other senior officials 
        resigning from their positions or departing Kyiv.
            (2) United States financial institutions are required to 
        apply enhanced scrutiny to private banking accounts held by or 
        on behalf of senior foreign political figures and to monitor 
        transactions that could potentially represent misappropriated 
        or diverted state assets, the proceeds of bribery or other 
        illegal payments, or other public corruption proceeds.
            (3) On March 3, 2014, the Government of Ukraine announced 
        that it had initiated criminal proceedings against a number of 
        former Ukrainian officials or close associates of former 
        Ukrainian officials.
            (4) On March 5, 2014, the European Union, based on 
        information from Ukraine's Prosecutor General, issued a Council 
        Regulation requiring the European Union to freeze the funds and 
        economic resources of various former Ukrainian officials and 
        their close associates.
            (5) The Government of Canada has taken similar action 
        against the same individuals.
            (6) The measures being taken against these former Ukrainian 
        officials and their close associates increase the risk that 
        they will seek to move their assets in a deceptive fashion.
            (7) Foreign financial institutions should apply similar, 
        enhanced due-diligence and reporting requirements.
            (8) The United States has a strong interest in seeing the 
        international financial system protected from illicit financial 
        activity, including money laundering, terrorism and 
        proliferation financing, transnational organized crime, and the 
        misappropriation of state assets, and international sanctions 
        evasion, among others.
            (9) The Department of the Treasury possesses a range of 
        authorities to insulate the United States financial system from 
        entities or jurisdictions that pose an illicit financing risk.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to use all of its regulatory and statutory authorities to 
closely scrutinize all foreign financial institutions, including those 
in the Russian Federation, that may be complicit in enabling foreign 
persons and transnational criminal enterprises to evade or otherwise 
circumvent United States and international sanctions, launder the 
proceeds of criminal activity, finance acts of terrorism and the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, or any other illicit 
activity that presents risks and vulnerabilities to the United States 
financial system.
    (c) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter for a 
        period not to exceed 2 years, the Secretary of State and the 
        Secretary of the Treasury shall jointly submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a report on--
                    (A) foreign financial institutions that are in 
                direct or indirect control of Government of Ukraine 
                state-owned or controlled assets without the knowledge
