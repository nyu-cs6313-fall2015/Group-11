        same capital standards as private banks or financial 
        institutions.
            ``(2) Annual determination.--Not less often than annually, 
        the Director shall review the guarantee fees charged by each 
        enterprise and determine how such fees compare to the amount 
        determined by the Director under paragraph (1). If the Director 
        determines that such fees charged by an enterprise are less 
        than such amount, the Director shall, by order, require the 
        enterprise to increase such fees in such amount as the Director 
        determines necessary to comply with paragraph (1).

        determine the amount of any increase under this subsection, the 
        Director shall establish a pricing mechanism as the Director 
        considers appropriate, taking into consideration current market 
        conditions, including the current market share of an 
        enterprise, and any data collected pursuant to section 1601 of

                                contracted significantly, as measured 
                                by the credit availability measure of 
                                the Office of the Comptroller of the

                                significantly, as measured by the 
                                applicable housing price index of the

                                economic conditions exist sufficient to 
                                evidence a significant contraction of 
                                capital in such county or counties, as 
                                measured by a metric identified by the 
                                Director and the Chief Risk Officer in

                        identify measurable criteria for determining 
                        that the conditions determined under clause (i) 
                        for such county or counties have ceased to

                between the mortgages insured under this title and the 
                National Housing Act and the business under such 
                provisions and the business of such enterprises; or
                    (B) if the FHA determines that such guidelines are 
                not so sufficient, the FHA shall adopt such guidelines 
                for purposes of this section, to the extent appropriate 
                and with changes referred to in subparagraph (A), 
                together with additional criteria sufficient to address

                which would conflict with the purposes of the FHA or 
                the National Housing Act; and
                    (C) product or service delivery will be conducted 
                in a manner that is efficient and effective, and that 
                will comply with the requirement under section 211(d).

mortgage on a residential property having 5 or more dwelling units 
unless the property is subject to such binding terms and conditions,

the FHA to ensure that the property includes dwelling units, to the 
extent determined by the FHA to be appropriate, for which occupancy is 
restricted during the entire term of the mortgage to only the following 
families:
            (1) In general.--A family having an income that is less 
        than 115 percent of the median income, as determined by the

                limitation in effect for that year on the original 
                principal obligation of a mortgage on a 1-family 
                residence that may be purchased by the Federal Home 
                Loan Mortgage Corporation, as determined under section 
                305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation

                        the FHA may not enter into any new commitment 
                        to insure any mortgage on a 1- to 4-family 
                        residential property that involves a principal 
                        obligation (including such initial service 
                        charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees 
                        as the FHA shall approve) in an amount 
                        exceeding 90 percent of the appraised value of 
                        the property; and
                            (ii) less than 2.0 percent but equal to or 
                        greater than 0.0 percent, the FHA may not enter 
                        into any new commitment to insure any mortgage 
                        on a 1- to 4-family residential property that 
                        involves a principal obligation (including such 
                        initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, 
                        and other fees as the FHA shall approve) in an 
                        amount exceeding 80 percent of the appraised 
                        value of the property.

    (b) Stress Test.--
            (1) In general.--The Director shall develop a risk-based 
        capital model to determine the amount of capital that is 
        sufficient for the FHA to maintain positive capital during a 
        period of economic stress. The model shall incorporate the 
        assumptions under paragraphs (2) and (3).
            (2) Credit risk.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
        Director shall assume that, during the period of economic 
        stress referred to in paragraph (1), credit losses occur at a 
        rate consistent with a nationwide economic recession of average 
        severity based on nationwide economic recessions since 1950.
            (3) Other risks.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
        Director shall make assumptions about such other aspects of the 
        period of economic stress as the Director determines are 
        appropriate and consistent.
    (c) Capital Restoration Plan Requirement.--If the account for the 
Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund established pursuant to section 
256(a)(1) is classified as undercapitalized or significantly 
undercapitalized, the FHA shall--
            (1) submit to the Director a capital restoration plan 
        meeting the requirements of section 258(d) for raising or 
        restoring the capital of such account to an amount not less 
        than the amount required for such account to be classified as 
        adequately capitalized; and
            (2) upon approval by the Director, carry out such plan.
If the Director disapproves a capital restoration plan submitted under 
this subsection, the Director shall convey in writing reasons for such 
disapproval and shall provide for the FHA to resubmit a revised plan 
for approval by the Director.

SEC. 258. ENFORCEMENT.

                disapproves the capital restoration plan submitted by 
                the FHA; or
                    (B) the FHA has failed to make, in good faith, 
                reasonable efforts necessary to comply with the capital 
                restoration plan; or
            (3) the FHA is engaging or has engaged, or the Director has 
        reasonable cause to believe that the FHA is about to engage 
        in--
                    (A) any conduct that is likely to threaten the 
                adequacy of the capital of the account for the Mutual 
                Mortgage Insurance Fund established pursuant to section 
                256(a)(1);
                    (B) any failure to comply with any written

                256(a)(1), is described in paragraph (2) or (3) of 
                subsection (a), or that contributes to the condition 
                described in subsection (a)(1); and
                    (B) with respect to any other Fund, contributes to

                threaten the adequacy of the capital of such Fund; and

submit the report to the President, the Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget, the Comptroller General of the United States,

            (2) such temporary and alternative capital classifications 
        as the Director shall establish shall be in effect with respect 
        to such Fund; and
            (3) the Director shall require the FHA or the Secretary of 
        Agriculture (as appropriate) to submit and carry out a capital 
        restoration plan for such Fund meeting the requirements under 
        section 258(d) and may take actions under section 258(b) with

established pursuant to subsection (a) shall terminate upon the earlier 
of--
            (1) the expiration of the 18-month period beginning upon 
        the date that notification under subsection (c) is provided to 
        the Congress of the determination under subsection (a); or
            (2) the occurrence of the conditions identified pursuant to

Act by such mortgagee approved by the FHA under the direct endorsement 
program or insured by a mortgagee pursuant to the delegation of 
authority under section 256 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 
1715z-21) such that the mortgage loan should not have been approved and 
endorsed for insurance, and the FHA pays an insurance claim with 
respect to the mortgage within a reasonable period specified by the 
FHA, the FHA may require the mortgagee approved by the FHA under the 
direct endorsement program or the mortgagee delegated authority under

mortgagee knew or should have known, based on the information then 
reasonably available to such mortgagee, of the fraud or material 
misrepresentation such that the mortgage loan should not have been 
approved and endorsed for insurance, the FHA shall require the 
mortgagee approved by the FHA under the direct endorsement program or 
the mortgagee delegated authority under such section 256 to indemnify 
the FHA for the loss, or any portion thereof, if the fraud or material 
misrepresentation was a materially contributing factor to the cause of 
the mortgage default.

appeals process for mortgagees to appeal indemnification determinations 
made pursuant to subsection (a) or (b).
    (d) Requirements and Procedures.--The FHA shall issue regulations 
establishing appropriate requirements and procedures governing the 
indemnification of the FHA by the mortgagee, including public reporting 
on--

                was a material contributing factor to the cause of the 
                mortgage default; and

        underwriting requirements that a mortgagee must follow to make 
        residential mortgage loans eligible for insurance by the FHA 
        which shall--
                    (A) provide clear and concise directions so that a

                uniformly with respect to all mortgages endorsed for

                advance notice to mortgagees, which such changes must

                mortgagee within six months of the FHA's receipt of 
                information that is reasonably sufficient to enable the 
                FHA to determine initially that a serious and material

               TITLE III--BUILDING A NEW MARKET STRUCTURE

              Subtitle A--National Mortgage Market Utility

SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``National Mortgage Market 
Utility Act of 2013''.

SEC. 302. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the liquidity and efficiency of the national housing 
        finance market is enhanced by a robust secondary market for 
        residential mortgage loans, including securities backed by 
        residential mortgage loans;
            (2) the financial crisis that began in 2007 revealed 
        weaknesses in the market infrastructure related to residential 
        mortgage-backed securities, including--
                    (A) weaknesses in standards--
                            (i) for underwriting and servicing 
                        residential mortgage loans that may be 
                        collateral for mortgage-backed securities; and
                            (ii) for issuers and trustees of such 
                        securities;
                    (B) weaknesses in the manner of recording and 
                registering ownership and security interests in 
                residential mortgage loans that backed pools of 
                securities; and
                    (C) weaknesses in the availability of information 
                to assess performance of pools;
            (3) weaknesses revealed in the financial crisis created 
        uncertainty and impeded timely and successful resolution of 
        troubled residential mortgage loans, and have impeded the 
        return of private capital to the market for securities backed 
        by residential mortgage loans in the absence of a Federal 
        guarantee of timely payment of principal and interest to 
        investors; and
            (4) improved standards and information availability and a 
        national system for registering mortgage-related documents, 
        including notes, mortgages and deeds of trust, and ownership 
        and security interests established therein, with standard 
        procedures for demonstrating the right to act with regard to 
        such notes or other registered data, would assist in addressing 
        these weaknesses.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the national mortgage market utility 
created by this title are--
            (1) to enhance efficiency, liquidity, and security in the 
        secondary market for residential mortgages, including mortgage-
        backed securities;
            (2) to establish standards related to originating and 
        servicing eligible collateral and for issuers and trustees of 
        qualified securities, which would be exempt from the Securities 
        Act of 1933;
            (3) to improve uniformity, quality and accessibility of 
        information related to the performance of residential mortgage 
        loans;
            (4) to operate a common securitization platform that could 
        be available to issuers of residential mortgage-backed 
        securities;
            (5) to foster the use and uniformity of electronic methods 
        for the creation, authentication, transmission, storage, and 
        availability of materials relating to mortgages;
            (6) to provide a central repository for notes, mortgages, 
        and other mortgage-related information, and address problems 
        that can arise when paper notes cannot be produced, due to loss 
        or destruction as a result of natural disaster or other causes; 
        and
            (7) to provide a uniform procedure for demonstrating the 
        right to act with regard to such notes or other registered data 
        for all actions in any State or Federal proceeding, judicial or 
        nonjudicial, involving such notes or other data.

    (a) In General.--Any person who shall make or cause to be made any 
statement in any application, report, or document filed with the Agency 
or Utility pursuant to any provisions of this subtitle, or any rule, 
regulation, or order thereunder, which statement was at the time and in 
light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading 
with respect to any material fact, or who shall omit to state any 
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the 
statements therein not misleading, shall be liable to any person (not 
knowing that such statement was false or misleading or of such 
omission) who, in reliance upon such statement or omission, shall have 
purchased or sold a qualified security issued under the indenture to 
which such application, report, or document relates, for damages caused 
by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that such person 
acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false 
or misleading or of such omission. A person seeking to enforce such 
liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of competent 
jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its discretion, 
require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit and 
assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against 
either party litigant, having due regard for the merits and good faith 
of the suit or defense. No action shall be maintained to enforce any 
liability created under this section unless brought within one year 
after the discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and 
within three years after such cause of action accrued.
    (b) Rights and Remedies Under Other Laws.--The rights and remedies 
provided by this part shall be in addition to any and all other rights 
and remedies that may exist under the Securities Act of 1933 or the

of this subtitle shall recover, through satisfaction of judgment in one 
or more actions, a total amount in excess of the person's actual 
damages on account of the act complained of.

or imply in any manner whatsoever that any action or failure to act by 
the Agency or Utility in the administration of this subtitle means that 
the Agency or Utility has in any way passed upon the merits of, or 
given approval to, any trustee, indenture, or security, or any 
transaction or transactions therein, or that any such action or failure 
to act with regard to any statement or report files or examined by the 
Agency or Utility pursuant to this subtitle or any rule, regulation, or 
order thereunder, has the effect of a finding by the Agency or Utility 
that such statement or report is true and accurate on its face or that

                the applicable covered bond regulator;
                    (D) any overnight investment in Federal funds;
                    (E) any other substitute asset designated by the 
                Secretary, by rule and in consultation with the covered 
                bond regulators; and
                    (F) any deposit account or securities account into 
                which only an asset described in subparagraph (A), (B), 
                (C), (D), or (E) may be deposited or credited.

SEC. 353. REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF COVERED BOND PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED.

    (a) Establishment.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, by rule and in 
        consultation with the covered bond regulators, establish a 
        covered bond regulatory oversight program that provides for--
                    (A) covered bond programs to be evaluated according 
                to reasonable and objective standards in order to be 
                approved under paragraph (2), including any additional 
                eligibility standards for eligible assets and any other 
                criteria determined appropriate by the Secretary to 
                further the purposes of this subtitle;
                    (B) covered bond programs to be maintained in a 
                manner that is consistent with this subtitle and safe 
                and sound asset-liability management and other 
                financial practices; and
                    (C) any estate created under section 354 to be 
                administered in a manner that is consistent with 
                maximizing the value and the proceeds of the related 
                cover pool in a resolution under this subtitle.
            (2) Approval of each covered bond program.--
                    (A) In general.--A covered bond shall be subject to 
                this subtitle only if the covered bond is issued by an 
                eligible issuer under a covered bond program that is 
                approved by the applicable covered bond regulator.
                    (B) Approval process.--Each covered bond regulator 
                shall apply the standards established by the Secretary 
                under the oversight program to evaluate a covered bond 
                program that has been submitted by an eligible issuer 
                for approval. Each covered bond regulator also shall 
                take into account relevant supervisory factors, 
                including safety and soundness considerations, in 
                evaluating a covered bond program that has been 
                submitted for approval. Each covered bond regulator, 
                promptly after approving a covered bond program, shall 
                provide the Secretary with the name of the covered bond 
                program, the name of the eligible issuer, and all other 
                information reasonably requested by the Secretary in 
                order to update the registry under paragraph (3)(A). 
                Each eligible issuer, promptly after issuing a covered 
                bond under an approved covered bond program, shall 
                provide the Secretary with all information reasonably 
                requested by the Secretary in order to update the 
                registry under paragraph (3)(B).
                    (C) Existing covered bond programs.--A covered bond 
                regulator may approve a covered bond program that is in 
                existence on the date of the enactment of this Act. 
                Upon such approval, each covered bond under the covered 
                bond program shall be subject to this subtitle, 
                regardless of when the covered bond was issued.
                    (D) Multiple covered bond programs permitted.--An 
                eligible issuer may have more than 1 covered bond 
                program.
                    (E) Cease and desist authority.--The applicable 
                covered bond regulator may direct an eligible issuer to 
                cease issuing covered bonds under an approved covered 
                bond program if the covered bond program is not 
                maintained in a manner that is consistent with this 
                subtitle and the oversight program and if, after notice 
                that is reasonable under the circumstances, the issuer 
                does not remedy all deficiencies identified by the 
                applicable covered bond regulator.
                    (F) Cap on the amount of outstanding covered 
                bonds.--
                            (i) In general.--With respect to each 
                        eligible issuer that submits a covered bond 
                        program for approval, the applicable covered 
                        bond regulator shall set, consistent with 
                        safety and soundness considerations and the 
                        financial condition of the eligible issuer, the 
                        maximum amount, as a percentage of the eligible 
                        issuer's total assets, of outstanding covered 
                        bonds that the eligible issuer may issue.
                            (ii) Review of cap.--The applicable covered 
                        bond regulator may, not more frequently than 
                        quarterly, review the percentage set under 
                        clause (i) and, if safety and soundness 
                        considerations or the financial condition of 
                        the eligible issuer has changed, increase or 
                        decrease such percentage. Any decrease made 
                        pursuant to this clause shall have no effect on 
                        existing covered bonds issued by the eligible 
                        issuer.
            (3) Registry.--Under the oversight program, the Secretary 
        shall maintain a registry that is published on a Web site 
        available to the public and that, for each covered bond program 
        approved by a covered bond regulator, contains--
                    (A) the name of the covered bond program, the name 
                of the eligible issuer, and all other information that 
                the Secretary considers necessary to adequately 
                identify the covered bond program and the eligible 
                issuer; and
                    (B) all information that the Secretary considers 
                necessary to adequately identify all outstanding 
                covered bonds issued under the covered bond program 
                (including the reports described in paragraphs (3) and 
                (4) of subsection (b)).
            (4) Fees.--Each covered bond regulator may levy, on the 
        issuers of covered bonds under the primary supervision of such 
        covered bond regulator, reasonably apportioned fees that such 
        covered bond regulator considers necessary, in the aggregate, 
        to defray the costs of such covered bond regulator carrying out 
        the provisions of this subtitle. Such funds shall not be 
        construed to be Government funds or appropriated monies and 
        shall not be subject to apportionment for purposes of chapter 
        15 of title 31, United States Code, or any other provision of 
        law.
    (b) Minimum Over-Collateralization Requirements.--
            (1) Requirements established.--The Secretary, by rule and 
        in consultation with the covered bond regulators, shall 
        establish minimum over-collateralization requirements for 
        covered bonds backed by each of the eligible asset classes. The 
        minimum over-collateralization requirements shall be designed 
        to ensure that sufficient eligible assets and substitute assets 
        are maintained in the cover pool to satisfy all principal and 
        interest payments on the covered bonds when due through 
        maturity and shall be based on the credit, collection, and 
        interest rate risks (excluding the liquidity risks) associated 
        with the eligible asset class.
            (2) Asset coverage test.--The eligible assets and the 
        substitute assets in any cover pool shall be required, in the 
        aggregate, to meet at all times the applicable minimum over-
        collateralization requirements.
            (3) Monthly reporting.--On a monthly basis, each issuer of 
        covered bonds shall submit a report on whether the cover pool 
        that secures the covered bonds meets the applicable minimum 
        over-collateralization requirements to--
                    (A) the Secretary;
                    (B) the applicable covered bond regulator;
                    (C) the applicable indenture trustee;
                    (D) the applicable covered bondholders; and
                    (E) the applicable independent asset monitor.
            (4) Independent asset monitor.--
                    (A) Appointment.--Each issuer of covered bonds 
                shall appoint the indenture trustee for the covered 
                bonds, or another unaffiliated entity, as an 
                independent asset monitor for the applicable cover 
                pool.
                    (B) Duties.--An independent asset monitor appointed 
                under subparagraph (A) shall, on an annual or other 
                more frequent periodic basis determined by the 
                Secretary under the oversight program--
                            (i) verify whether the cover pool meets the 
                        applicable minimum over-collateralization 
                        requirements; and
                            (ii) report to the Secretary, the 
                        applicable covered bond regulator, the 
                        applicable indenture trustee, and the 
                        applicable covered bondholders on whether the 
                        cover pool meets the applicable minimum over-
                        collateralization requirements.
            (5) No loss of status.--Covered bonds shall remain subject 
        to this subtitle regardless of whether the applicable cover 
        pool ceases to meet the applicable minimum over-
        collateralization requirements.
            (6) Failure to meet requirements.--
                    (A) In general.--If a cover pool fails to meet the 
                applicable minimum over-collateralization requirements, 
                and if the failure is not cured within the time 
                specified in the related transaction documents, the 
                failure shall be an uncured default for purposes of 
                section 354(a).
                    (B) Notice required.--An issuer of covered bonds 
                shall promptly give the Secretary and the applicable 
                covered bond regulator written notice if the cover pool 
                securing the covered bonds fails to meet the applicable 
                minimum over-collateralization requirements, if the 
                failure is cured within the time specified in the 
                related transaction documents, or if the failure is not 
                so cured.
    (c) Requirements for Eligible Assets.--
            (1) Requirements.--
                    (A) Loans.--A loan shall not qualify as an eligible 
                asset for so long as the loan is delinquent for more 
                than 60 consecutive days.
                    (B) Securities.--A security shall not qualify as an 
                eligible asset for so long as the security does not 
                meet any credit-quality requirement under this 
                subtitle.
                    (C) Origination.--An asset shall not qualify as an 
                eligible asset if the asset was not originated in 
                compliance with any rule or supervisory guidance of a 
                Federal agency applicable to the asset at the time of 
                origination.
                    (D) No double pledge.--An asset shall not qualify 
                as an eligible asset for so long as the asset is 
                subject to a prior perfected security interest or other 
                prior perfected lien that has been granted in an 
                unrelated transaction. Nothing in this subtitle shall 
                affect such a prior perfected security interest or 
                other prior perfected lien, and the rights of such lien 
                holders.
            (2) Failure to meet requirements.--Subject to paragraph 
        (1)(D), if an asset in a cover pool does not satisfy any 
        applicable requirement described in paragraph (1) or any other 
        applicable standard or criterion described in this subtitle, 
        the oversight program, or the related transaction documents, 
        the asset shall not qualify as an eligible asset for purposes 
        of the asset coverage test described in subsection (b)(2). A 
        disqualified asset shall remain in the cover pool unless and 
        until removed by the issuer in compliance with the provisions 
        of this subtitle, the oversight program, and the related 
        transaction documents. No disqualified asset may be removed 
        from the cover pool after an estate has been created for the 
        related covered bond program under section 354(b)(1) or 
        354(c)(2), except in connection with the management of the 
        cover pool under section 354(d)(1)(E).
    (d) Other Requirements.--
            (1) Books and records of issuer.--Each issuer of covered 
        bonds shall clearly mark its books and records to identify the 
        assets that comprise the cover pool securing the covered bonds.
            (2) Schedule of eligible assets and substitute assets.--
        Each issuer of covered bonds shall deliver to the applicable 
        indenture trustee and the applicable independent asset monitor, 
        on at least a monthly basis, a schedule that identifies all 
        eligible assets and substitute assets in the cover pool 
        securing the covered bonds.
            (3) Single eligible asset class.--No cover pool described 
        in section 352(3)(A) may include eligible assets from more than 
        1 eligible asset class. No cover poll described in section 
        2(3)(B) may include covered bonds backed by more than 1 
        eligible asset class.

SEC. 354. RESOLUTION UPON DEFAULT OR INSOLVENCY.

    (a) Uncured Default Defined.--For purposes of this section, the 
term ``uncured default'' means a default on a covered bond that has not 
been cured within the time, if any, specified in the related 
transaction documents.
    (b) Default on Covered Bonds Prior to Conservatorship, 
Receivership, Liquidation, or Bankruptcy.--
            (1) Creation of separate estate.--If an uncured default 
        occurs on a covered bond before the issuer of the covered bond 
        enters conservatorship, receivership, liquidation, or 
        bankruptcy, an estate shall be immediately and automatically 
        created by operation of law and shall exist and be administered 
        separate and apart from the issuer or any subsequent 
        conservatorship, receivership, liquidating agency, or estate in 
        bankruptcy for the issuer or any other assets of the issuer. A 
        separate estate shall be created for each affected covered bond 
        program.
            (2) Assets and liabilities of estate.--Any estate created 
        under paragraph (1) shall be comprised of the cover pool 
        (including over-collateralization in the cover pool) that 
        secures the covered bond. The cover pool shall be immediately 
        and automatically released to and held by the estate free and 
        clear of any right, title, interest, or claim of the issuer or 
        any conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in 
        bankruptcy for the issuer or any other assets of the issuer. 
        The estate shall be fully liable on the covered bond and all 
        other covered bonds and related obligations of the issuer 
        (including obligations under related derivative transactions) 
        that are secured by a perfected security interest in or other 
        perfected lien on the cover pool when the estate is created. 
        The estate shall not be liable on any obligation of the issuer 
        that is not secured by a perfected security interest in or 
        other perfected lien on the cover pool when the estate is 
        created. No conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or 
        trustee in bankruptcy for the issuer may charge or assess the 
        estate for any claim of the conservator, receiver, liquidating 
        agent, or trustee in bankruptcy or the conservatorship, 
        receivership, liquidating agency, or estate in bankruptcy and 
        may not obtain or perfect a security interest in or other lien 
        on the cover pool to secure such a claim.
            (3) Retention of claims.--Any holder of a covered bond or 
        related obligation for which an estate has become liable under 
        paragraph (2) shall retain a claim against the issuer for any 
        deficiency with respect to the covered bond or related 
        obligation. If the issuer enters conservatorship, receivership, 
        liquidation, or bankruptcy, any contingent claim for such a 
        deficiency shall be allowed as a provable claim in the 
        conservatorship, receivership, liquidating agency, or 
        bankruptcy case. The contingent claim shall be estimated by the 
        conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or bankruptcy court 
        for purposes of allowing the claim as a provable claim if 
        awaiting the fixing of the contingent claim would unduly delay 
        the resolution of the conservatorship, receivership, 
        liquidating agency, or bankruptcy case.
            (4) Residual interest.--
                    (A) Issuance of residual interest.--Upon the 
                creation of an estate under paragraph (1), a residual 
                interest in the estate shall be immediately and 
                automatically issued by operation of law to the issuer.
                    (B) Nature of residual interest.--The residual 
                interest under subparagraph (A) shall--
                            (i) be an exempted security as described in 
                        section 355;
                            (ii) represent the right to any surplus 
                        from the cover pool after the covered bonds and 
                        all other liabilities of the estate have been 
                        fully and irrevocably paid; and
                            (iii) be evidenced by a certificate 
                        executed by the trustee of the estate.
            (5) Obligations of issuer.--
                    (A) In general.--After the creation of an estate 
                under paragraph (1), the issuer shall--
                            (i) transfer to or at the direction of the 
                        trustee for the estate all property of the 
                        estate that is in the possession or under the 
                        control of the issuer, including all tangible 
                        or electronic books, records, files, and other 
                        documents or materials relating to the assets 
                        and liabilities of the estate; and
                            (ii) at the election of the trustee or a 
                        servicer or administrator for the estate, 
                        continue servicing the applicable cover pool 
                        for 120 days after the creation of the estate 
                        in return for a fair-market-value fee, as 
                        determined by the trustee in consultation with 
                        the applicable covered bond regulator, that 
                        shall be payable from the estate as an 
                        administrative expense.
                    (B) Obligations absolute.--Neither the issuer, 
                whether acting as debtor in possession or in any other 
                capacity, nor any conservator, receiver, liquidating 
                agent, or trustee in bankruptcy for the issuer or any 
                other assets of the issuer may disaffirm, repudiate, or 
                reject the obligation to turn over property or to 
                continue servicing the cover pool as provided in 
                subparagraph (A).
    (c) Default on Covered Bonds Upon Conservatorship, Receivership, 
Liquidation, or Bankruptcy.--
            (1) Corporation conservatorship or receivership.--
                    (A) In general.--If the Corporation is appointed as 
                conservator or receiver for an issuer of covered bonds 
                before an uncured default results in the creation of an 
                estate under subsection (b), the Corporation as 
                conservator or receiver shall have an exclusive right, 
                during the 1-year period beginning on the date of the 
                appointment, to transfer any cover pool owned by the 
                issuer in its entirety, together with all covered bonds 
                and related obligations that are secured by a perfected 
                security interest in or other perfected lien on the 
                cover pool, to another eligible issuer that meets all 
                conditions and requirements specified in the related 
                transaction documents. The Corporation as conservator 
                or receiver may not remove any asset from the cover 
                pool, except to the extent otherwise agreed by a 
                transferee that has assumed the covered bond program 
                pursuant to subparagraph (C).
                    (B) Obligations during 1-year period.--During the 
                1-year period described in subparagraph (A), the 
                Corporation as conservator or receiver shall fully and 
                timely satisfy all monetary and nonmonetary obligations 
                of the issuer under all covered bonds and the related 
                transaction documents and shall fully and timely cure 
                all defaults by the issuer (other than its 
                conservatorship or receivership) under the applicable 
                covered bond program, in each case, until the earlier 
                of--
                            (i) the transfer of the applicable covered 
                        bond program to another eligible issuer as 
                        provided in subparagraph (A); or
                            (ii) the delivery to the Secretary, the 
                        applicable covered bond regulator, the 
                        applicable indenture trustee, and the 
                        applicable covered bondholders of a written 
                        notice from the Corporation as conservator or 
                        receiver electing to cease further performance 
                        under the applicable covered bond program.
                    (C) Assumption by transferee.--If the Corporation 
                as conservator or receiver transfers a covered bond 
                program to another eligible issuer within the 1-year 
                period as provided in subparagraph (A), the transferee 
                shall take ownership of the applicable cover pool and 
                shall become fully liable on all covered bonds and 
                related obligations of the issuer that are secured by a 
                perfected security interest in or other perfected lien 
                on the cover pool.
            (2) Other circumstances.--An estate shall be immediately 
        and automatically created by operation of law and shall exist 
        and be administered separate and apart from an issuer of 
        covered bonds and any conservatorship, receivership, 
        liquidating agency, or estate in bankruptcy for the issuer or 
        any other assets of the issuer, if--
                    (A) a conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or 
                trustee in bankruptcy, other than the Corporation, is 
                appointed for the issuer before an uncured default 
                results in the creation of an estate under subsection 
                (b); or
                    (B) in the case of the appointment of the 
                Corporation as conservator or receiver as described in 
                paragraph (1)(A), the Corporation as conservator or 
                receiver--
                            (i) does not complete the transfer of the 
                        applicable covered bond program to another 
                        eligible issuer within the 1-year period as 
                        provided in paragraph (1)(A);
                            (ii) delivers to the Secretary, the 
                        applicable covered bond regulator, the 
                        applicable indenture trustee, and the 
                        applicable covered bondholders a written notice 
                        electing to cease further performance under the 
                        applicable covered bond program; or
                            (iii) fails to fully and timely satisfy all 
                        monetary and nonmonetary obligations of the 
                        issuer under the covered bonds and the related 
                        transaction documents or to fully and timely 
                        cure all defaults by the issuer (other than its 
                        conservatorship or receivership) under the 
                        applicable covered bond program.
        A separate estate shall be created for each affected covered 
        bond program.
            (3) Assets and liabilities of estate.--Any estate created 
        under paragraph (2) shall be comprised of the cover pool 
        (including over-collateralization in the cover pool) that 
        secures the covered bonds. The cover pool shall be immediately 
        and automatically released to and held by the estate free and 
        clear of any right, title, interest, or claim of the issuer or 
        any conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in 
        bankruptcy for the issuer or any other assets of the issuer. 
        The estate shall be fully liable on the covered bonds and all 
        other covered bonds and related obligations of the issuer 
        (including obligations under related derivative transactions) 
        that are secured by a perfected security interest in or other 
        perfected lien on the cover pool when the estate is created. 
        The estate shall not be liable on any obligation of the issuer 
        that is not secured by a perfected security interest in or 
        other perfected lien on the cover pool when the estate is 
        created. No conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or 
        trustee in bankruptcy for the issuer may charge or assess the 
        estate for any claim of the conservator, receiver, liquidating 
        agent, or trustee in bankruptcy or the conservatorship, 
        receivership, liquidating agency, or estate in bankruptcy and 
        may not obtain or perfect a security interest in or other lien 
        on the cover pool to secure such a claim.
            (4) Contingent claim.--Any contingent claim against an 
        issuer for a deficiency with respect to a covered bond or 
        related obligation for which an estate has become liable under 
        paragraph (3) shall be allowed as a provable claim in the 
        conservatorship, receivership, liquidating agency, or 
        bankruptcy case for the issuer. The contingent claim shall be 
        estimated by the conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or 
        bankruptcy court for purposes of allowing the claim as a 
        provable claim if awaiting the fixing of the contingent claim 
        would unduly delay the resolution of the conservatorship, 
        receivership, liquidating agency, or bankruptcy case.
            (5) Residual interest.--
                    (A) Issuance of residual interest.--Upon the 
                creation of an estate under paragraph (2), and 
                regardless of whether any contingent claim described in 
                paragraph (4) becomes fixed or is estimated, a residual 
                interest in the estate shall be immediately and 
                automatically issued by operation of law to the 
                conservator, receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in 
                bankruptcy for the issuer.
                    (B) Nature of residual interest.--The residual 
                interest under subparagraph (A) shall--
                            (i) be an exempted security as described in 
                        section 355;
                            (ii) represent the right to any surplus 
                        from the cover pool after the covered bonds and 
                        all other liabilities of the estate have been 
                        fully and irrevocably paid; and
                            (iii) be evidenced by a certificate 
                        executed by the trustee of the estate.
            (6) Obligations of issuer.--
                    (A) In general.--After the creation of an estate 
                under paragraph (2), the issuer and its conservator, 
                receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in bankruptcy 
                shall--
                            (i) transfer to or at the direction of the 
                        trustee for the estate all property of the 
                        estate that is in the possession or under the 
                        control of the issuer or its conservator, 
                        receiver, liquidating agent, or trustee in 
                        bankruptcy, including all tangible or 
                        electronic books, records, files, and other 
                        documents or materials relating to the assets 
                        and liabilities of the estate; and
                            (ii) at the election of the trustee or a 
                        servicer or administrator for the estate, 
                        continue servicing the applicable cover pool 
                        for 120 days after the creation of the estate 
                        in return for a fair-market-value fee, as 
                        determined by the trustee in consultation with 
                        the applicable covered bond regulator, that 
                        shall be payable from the estate as an 
                        administrative expense.
                    (B) Obligations absolute.--Neither the issuer, 
                whether acting as debtor in possession or in any other 
                capacity, nor any conservator, receiver, liquidating 
                agent, or trustee in bankruptcy for the issuer or any 
                other assets of the issuer may disaffirm, repudiate, or 
                reject the obligation to turn over property or to 
                continue servicing the cover pool as provided in 
                subparagraph (A).
    (d) Administration and Resolution of Estates.--
            (1) Trustee, servicer, and administrator.--
                    (A) In general.--Upon the creation of any estate 
                under subsection (b)(1) or (c)(2), the applicable 
                covered bond regulator shall--
                            (i) appoint the trustee for the estate;
                            (ii) appoint 1 or more servicers or 
                        administrators for the cover pool held by the 
                        estate; and
                            (iii) give the Secretary, the applicable 
                        indenture trustee, the applicable covered 
                        bondholders, and the owner of the residual 
                        interest written notice of the creation of the 
                        estate.
                    (B) Terms and conditions of appointment.--All terms 
                and conditions of any appointment under paragraph (1), 
                including the terms and conditions relating to 
                compensation, shall conform to the requirements of this 
                subtitle and the oversight program and otherwise shall 
                be determined by the applicable covered bond regulator.
                    (C) Qualification.--The applicable covered bond 
                regulator may require the trustee or any servicer or 
                administrator for an estate to post in favor of the 
                United States, for the benefit of the estate, a bond 
                that is conditioned on the faithful performance of the 
                duties of the trustee or the servicer or administrator. 
                The covered bond regulator shall determine the amount 
                of any bond required under this subparagraph and the 
                sufficiency of the surety on the bond. A proceeding on 
                a bond required under this subparagraph may not be 
                commenced after two years after the date on which the 
                trustee or the servicer or administrator was 
                discharged.
                    (D) Powers and duties of trustee.--The trustee for 
                an estate is the representative of the estate and, 
                subject to the provisions of this subtitle, has 
                capacity to sue and be sued. The trustee shall--

                            (ii) be accountable for all property of the 
                        estate that is received by the trustee;
                            (iii) make a final report and file a final 
                        account of the administration of the estate 
                        with the applicable covered bond regulator; and
                            (iv) after the estate has been fully 
                        administered, close the estate.
                    (E) Powers and duties of servicer or

                                liquidation or other means), and 
                                otherwise manage the cover pool held by 
                                the estate for the purpose of winding 
                                down the related cover bond program in 
                                compliance with this subtitle, the 
                                oversight program, and the related 
                                transaction documents and in a manner 
                                consistent with maximizing the value 
                                and the proceeds of the cover pool;
                                    (II) deposit or invest all proceeds 
                                and funds received in compliance with

                                and in a manner consistent with 
                                maximizing the net return to the 
                                estate, taking into account the safety 
                                of the deposit or investment; and
                                    (III) apply, or direct the trustee 
                                for the estate to apply, all proceeds 
                                and funds received and the net return 
                                on any deposit or investment to make 
                                distributions in compliance with 
                                paragraphs (3) and (4);
                            (ii) may borrow funds or otherwise obtain 
                        credit, for the benefit of the estate, in 
                        compliance with paragraph (2) on a secured or 
                        unsecured basis and on a priority, pari passu, 
                        or subordinated basis;
                            (iii) shall, at the times and in the manner 
                        required by the applicable covered bond 
                        regulator, submit to the covered bond 
                        regulator, the Secretary, the applicable 
                        indenture trustee, the applicable covered 
                        bondholders, the owner of the residual 
                        interest, and any other person designated by 
                        the covered bond regulator, reports that 
                        describe the activities of the servicer or 
                        administrator on behalf of the estate, the 
                        performance of the cover pool held by the 
                        estate, and distributions made by the estate; 
                        and
                            (iv) shall assist the trustee in preparing 
                        the final report and the final account of the 
                        administration of the estate.
                    (F) Supervision of trustee, servicer, and 
                administrator.--The applicable covered bond regulator 
                shall supervise the trustee and any servicer or 
                administrator for an estate. The covered bond regulator 
                shall require that all reports submitted under 
                subparagraph (E)(iii) do not contain any untrue 
                statement of a material fact and do not omit to state a 
                material fact necessary in order to make the statements 
                made, in light of the circumstances under which they 
                are made, not misleading.
                    (G) Removal and replacement of trustee, servicer, 
                and administrator.--If the covered bond regulator 
                determines that it is in the best interests of an 
                estate, the covered bond regulator may remove or 
                replace the trustee or any servicer or administrator 
                for the estate. The removal of the trustee or any 
                servicer or administrator does not abate any pending 
                action or proceeding involving the estate, and any 
                successor or other trustee, servicer, or administrator 
                shall be substituted as a party in the action or 
                proceeding.
                    (H) Professionals.--The trustee or any servicer or 
                administrator for an estate may employ 1 or more 
                attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or 
                other professional persons to represent or assist the 
                trustee or the servicer or administrator in carrying 
                out its duties. The employment of any professional 
                person and all terms and conditions of employment, 
                including the terms and conditions relating to 
                compensation, shall conform to the requirements of this 
                subtitle and the oversight program and otherwise shall 
                be subject to the approval of the applicable covered 
                bond regulator.
                    (I) Approved fees and expenses.--Unless otherwise 
                provided in the applicable terms and conditions of 
                appointment or employment, all approved fees and 
                expenses of the trustee, any servicer or administrator, 
                or any professional person employed by the trustee or 
                any servicer or administrator shall be payable from the 
                estate as administrative expenses.
                    (J) Actions by or on behalf of estate.--The trustee 
                or any servicer or administrator for an estate may 
                commence or continue judicial, administrative, or other 
                actions, in the name of the estate or in its own name 
                on behalf of the estate, for the purpose of collecting, 
                realizing on, or otherwise managing the cover pool held 
                by the estate or exercising its other powers or duties 
                on behalf of the estate.
                    (K) Actions against estate.--No court may issue an 
                attachment or execution on any property of an estate. 
                Except at the request of the applicable covered bond 
                regulator or as otherwise provided in this subparagraph 
                or subparagraph (J), no court may take any action to 
                restrain or affect the resolution of an estate under 
                this subtitle. No person (including the applicable 
                indenture trustee and any applicable covered 
                bondholder) may commence or continue any judicial, 
                administrative, or other action against the estate, the 
                trustee, or any servicer or administrator or take any 
                other act to affect the estate, the trustee, or any 
                servicer or administrator that is not expressly 
                permitted by this subtitle, the oversight program, and 
                the related transaction documents, except for a 
                judicial or administrative action to compel the release 
                of funds that--
                            (i) are available to the estate;
                            (ii) are permitted to be distributed under 
                        this subtitle and the oversight program; and
                            (iii) are permitted and required to be 
                        distributed under the related transaction 
                        documents and any contracts executed by or on 
                        behalf of the estate.
                    (L) Sovereign immunity.--Except in connection with 
                a guarantee provided under paragraph (4) or any other 
                contract executed by the applicable covered bond 
                regulator under this section 354, the Secretary and the 
                covered bond regulator shall be entitled to sovereign 
                immunity in carrying out the provisions of this 
                subtitle.
            (2) Borrowings and credit.--
                    (A) In general.--Any servicer or administrator for 
                an estate created under subsection (b)(1) or (c)(2) may 
                borrow funds or otherwise obtain credit, on behalf of 
                and for the benefit of the estate, from any person in 
                compliance with this paragraph (2) solely for the 
                purpose of providing liquidity in the case of timing 
                mismatches among the assets and the liabilities of the 
                estate. Except with respect to an underwriter, section 
                5 of the Securities Act of 1933, the Trust Indenture 
                Act of 1939, and any State or local law requiring 
                registration for an offer or sale of a security or 
                registration or licensing of an issuer of, underwriter 
                of, or broker or dealer in a security does not apply to 
                the offer or sale under this paragraph (2) of a 
                security that is not an equity security.
                    (B) Conditions.--A servicer or administrator may 
                borrow funds or otherwise obtain credit under 
                subparagraph (A)--
                            (i) on terms affording the lender only 
                        claims or liens that are fully subordinated to 
                        the claims and interests of the applicable 
                        indenture trustee and the applicable covered 
                        bondholders and all other claims against and 
                        interests in the estate, except for the 
                        residual interest, if the servicer or 
                        administrator certifies to the applicable 
                        covered bond regulator that, in the business 
                        judgment of the servicer or administrator, the 
                        borrowing or credit is in the best interests of 
                        the estate and is expected to maximize the 
                        value and the proceeds of the cover pool held 
                        by the estate; or
                            (ii) on terms affording the lender claims 
                        or liens that have priority over or are pari 
                        passu with the claims or interests of the 
                        applicable indenture trustee or the applicable 
                        covered bondholders or other claims against or 
                        interests in the estate, if--
                                    (I) the servicer or administrator 
                                certifies to the applicable covered 
                                bond regulator that, in the business 
                                judgment of the servicer or 
                                administrator, the borrowing or credit 
                                is in the best interests of the estate 
                                and is expected to maximize the value 
                                and the proceeds of the cover pool held 
                                by the estate; and
                                    (II) the applicable covered bond 
                                regulator authorizes the borrowing or 
                                credit.
                    (C) Limited liability.--A servicer or administrator 
                shall not be liable for any error in business judgment 
                when borrowing funds or otherwise obtaining credit 
                under this paragraph (2) unless the servicer or 
                administrator acted in bad faith or in willful 
                disregard of its duties.
                    (D) Limits on borrowings and credit.--Funds may not 
                be borrowed or credit otherwise obtained under 
                subparagraph (A)--
                            (i) for the purpose of investing in 
                        additional portfolios of eligible assets 
                        through the issuance of new covered bonds; or
                            (ii) otherwise for a purpose other than 
                        winding down the related covered bond program 
                        in compliance with this Act, the oversight 
                        program, and the related transaction documents.
                    (E) Study on borrowings and credit.--The 
                Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct 
                a study on whether the Federal reserve banks should be 
                authorized to lend funds or otherwise extend credit to 
                an estate under this paragraph (2) and, if so, what 
                conditions and limits should be established to mitigate 
                any risk that the United States Government could absorb 
                credit losses on the cover pool held by the estate. The 
                Comptroller General shall submit a report to the 
                Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the 
                Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the 
                House of Representatives on the results of the study 
                not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of 
                this Act.
            (3) Distributions by estate.--All payments or other 
        distributions by an estate shall be made at the times, in the 
        amounts, and in the manner set forth in the covered bonds, the 
        related transaction documents, and any contracts executed by or 
        on behalf of the estate in compliance with this subtitle and 
        the oversight program. To the extent that the relative priority 
        of the liabilities of the estate are not specified in or 
        otherwise ascertainable from their terms, distributions shall 
        be made on each distribution date under the covered bonds, the 
        related transaction documents, or any contracts executed by or 
        on behalf of the estate--
                    (A) first, to pay accrued and unpaid superpriority 
                claims under paragraph (2)(B)(ii);
                    (B) second, to pay accrued and unpaid 
                administrative expense claims under paragraph (1)(I), 
                paragraph (2)(B)(ii), section 354(b)(5)(A), or section 
                354(c)(6)(A);
                    (C) third, to pay--
                            (i) accrued and unpaid claims under the 
                        covered bonds and the related transaction 
                        documents according to their terms; and
                            (ii) accrued and unpaid pari passu claims 
                        under paragraph (2)(B)(ii); and
                    (D) fourth, to pay accrued and unpaid subordinated 
                claims under paragraph (2)(B)(i).
            (4) Distributions on residual interest.--After all other 
        claims against and interests in an estate have been fully and 
        irrevocably paid or defeased, the trustee shall or shall cause 
        a servicer or administrator to distribute the remainder of the 
        estate to or at the direction of the owner of the residual 
        interest. No interim distribution on the residual interest may 
        be made before that time, unless the applicable covered bond 
        regulator--
                    (A) approves the distribution after determining 
                that all other claims against and interests in the 
                estate will be fully, timely, and irrevocably paid 
                according to their terms; and
                    (B) provides an indemnity, for the benefit of the 
                estate, assuring that all other claims against and 
                interests in the estate will be fully, timely, and 
                irrevocably paid according to their terms.
            (5) Closing of estate.--After an estate has been fully 
        administered, the trustee shall close the estate and, except as 
        otherwise directed by the applicable covered bond regulator, 
        shall destroy all records of the estate.
            (6) No loss to taxpayers.--Taxpayers shall bear no losses 
        from the resolution of an estate under this subtitle. To the 
        extent that the Secretary and the Corporation jointly determine 
        that the Deposit Insurance Fund incurred actual losses that are 
        higher because the covered bond program of an insured 
        depository institution was subject to resolution under this 
        subtitle rather than as part of the receivership of the 
        institution under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
        1811 et seq.), the Corporation may exercise the powers 
        available under section 7(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
        Act (12 U.S.C. 1817(b)) to recover an amount equal to those 
        losses after consulting with the Secretary.

    (a) Existing Exemptions Applicable to Covered Bonds.--
            (1) Treatment of certain banks and other entities.--Any 
        covered bond issued or guaranteed by a bank or by an eligible 
        issuer described in section 352(9)(D) and sponsored solely by 1

        and shall be treated as a security issued or guaranteed by a 
        bank under section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 
        U.S.C. 77c(a)(2)), section 3(c)(3) of the Investment Company 
        Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(3)), and section 304(a)(4)(A) 
        of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. 77ddd(a)(4)(A)). 
        No covered bond issued or guaranteed by a bank or by an 
        eligible issuer described in section 352(9)(D) and sponsored 
        solely by 1 or more banks for the sole purpose of issuing 
        covered bonds shall be treated as an asset-backed security (as 
        defined in section 3 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 
        (15 U.S.C. 78c)). Each covered bond regulator for 1 or more 
        banks shall adopt disclosure and reporting regulations for 
        offers or sales of covered bonds by a bank or an eligible 
        issuer described in this paragraph. Such regulations shall 
        provide for uniform and consistent standards for such covered 
        bond issuers, to the extent possible, and shall be consistent 
        with existing regulations governing offers or sales of 
        nonconvertible debt.
            (2) Treatment of certain associations and cooperative 
        banks.--Any covered bond issued by an entity described in 
        section 3(a)(5)(A) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 
        77c(a)(5)(A)) or by an eligible issuer described in section 
        352(9)(D) and sponsored solely by 1 or more such entities for 
        the sole purpose of issuing covered bonds is and shall be 
        treated as a security issued by such an entity under section 
        3(a)(5)(A) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 
        77c(a)(5)(A)), section 3(c)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 
        1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-3(c)(3)), and section 304(a)(4)(A) of the 
        Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. 77ddd(a)(4)(A)). No 
        covered bond issued by an entity described in section 
        3(a)(5)(A) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 
        77c(a)(5)(A)) or by an eligible issuer described in section 
        352(9)(D) and sponsored solely by 1 or more such entities for 
        the sole purpose of issuing covered bonds shall be treated as 
        an asset-backed security (as defined in section 3 of the 
        Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c)). Each 
        covered bond regulator for 1 or more entities described in 
        section 3(a)(5)(A) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 
        77c(a)(5)(A)) shall adopt, as part of the securities 
        regulations of the covered bond regulator, a separate scheme of 
        registration, disclosure, and reporting obligations and 
        exemptions for offers or sales of covered bonds that are 
        described in this paragraph. Such regulations shall provide for 
        uniform and consistent standards for such covered bond issuers, 
        to the extent possible, and shall be consistent with 
        regulations governing offers or sales of similar securities.
            (3) Construction.--No provision of this subtitle, including 
        paragraph (1) or (2), may be construed or applied in a manner 
        that impairs or limits any other exemption that is available 
        under applicable securities laws.
    (b) Exemptions for Estates.--Any estate that is or may be created 
under section 354(b)(1) or 354(c)(2) shall be exempt from all

        established by the applicable covered bond regulator under 
        section 354(d)(1)(E)(iii); and
            (2) shall succeed to any requirement of the issuer to file 
        such periodic information, documents, and reports in respect of 
        the covered bonds as specified in section 13(a) of the 
        Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(a)) or rules 
        established by an appropriate Federal banking agency.

        loss is recognized under section 1001 of the Internal Revenue 
        Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1001), the transfer or assumption shall

             TITLE IV--REMOVING BARRIERS TO NEW INVESTMENT

SEC. 401. BASEL III IMPACT STUDY.

    (a) In General.--The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency (in this section collectively referred 
to as the ``Federal banking agencies'') shall conduct an empirical 
study on the Regulatory Capital Rules finalized by the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve on July 2, 2013 (``Final Rule'') in 
accordance with subsection (b) and release a final report in accordance 
with subsection (d).
    (b) Issues To Be Studied.--The study required under subsection (a) 
shall include--
            (1) the potential impact of the Final Rule on the financial 
        services sector of the United States, and specifically covered 
        financial institutions, including changes to required capital 
        levels in the aggregate, per asset class and institution size;
            (2) the long-term potential impact of the Final Rule, 
        including changes to the current risk weight framework;
            (3) the potential cost and complexity of the Final Rule for 
        covered financial institutions;
            (4) the potential indicators of covered financial 
        institutions having to maintain higher leverage capital ratios 
        and higher total risk-based capital ratios than non-covered 
        financial institutions, and if such capital levels are 
        commensurate with higher historical losses or greater risk;
            (5) whether the Final Rule will cause capital levels at 
        covered financial institutions to fluctuate with more frequency 
        or by greater amounts than the current capital rules and what, 
        if any, safety and soundness issues such fluctuations raise for 
        covered financial institutions or the financial system 
        including whether such fluctuations will make the United States 
        financial system more or less safe than the current rules;
            (6) whether the Final Rule will result in the 
        discontinuation of the use of certain risk management tools by 
        covered financial institutions and thereby undermine the safety 
        and soundness of covered financial institutions and the 
        financial system;
            (7) the cumulative impact that the Final Rule will have 
        on--
                    (A) United States economic growth, in general, and 
                specifically, on the Gross Domestic Product;
                    (B) the availability and cost of credit, both 
                generally and in low- and moderate-income areas;
                    (C) the availability and cost of residential 
                mortgages and home equity lines of credit, auto loans, 
                student loans, and commercial loans, including small 
                business loans; and
                    (D) regulatory capital levels, capital quality, 
                asset quality, and risk management at covered financial 
                institutions.
    (c) Voluntary Participation.--Any financial institution may 
voluntarily provide information for the study upon the request of the 
Federal banking agencies, but may not be required to provide such 
information.
    (d) Final Report.--
            (1) Availability to the public.--A final report on the 
        completed study required under subsection (a) shall be made 
        available to the public for notice and comment for a period of 
        not less than 90 days.
            (2) Report to congress.--The Federal banking agencies shall 
        issue a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban 
        Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services 
        of the House of Representatives, and testify before such 
        committees, on the results of the study required under 
        subsection (a) and a summary of the comments received under 
        paragraph (1).
            (3) Review.--The Federal banking agencies shall review any 
        comments submitted under paragraphs (1) and (2) and 
        considerations provided pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2), and 
        following such review, shall prescribe new rules, if 
        appropriate, based on the results of the study and such 
        comments and considerations. Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of law, a new rulemaking following such comment 
        period shall include an additional comment period of not less 
        than 90 days.
    (e) Delay of Rulemaking.--The Final Rule may not take effect for a 
covered financial institution until the later of--
            (1) 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act; 
        and
            (2) 1 year after the promulgation of revised rules in 
        accordance with subsection (d)(3) or a determination by the 
        Federal banking agencies that no revised rules are needed in 
        accordance with that subsection, which shall be published in 
        the Federal Register.
    (f) Definition of Covered Financial Institution.--For purposes of 
this section, the term ``covered financial institution'' means any 
bank, thrift, bank holding company, and savings and loan holding 
company (as such terms are defined under section 3 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act) other than a bank, thrift, bank holding company, 
or savings and loan holding company identified by the Financial 
Stability Board as a ``global systemically important bank'', as of the 
date of the enactment of this Act.

Ratio amendments, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,

Comptroller of the Currency may not require, as a condition for status 
as a high quality liquid asset, that residential mortgage-backed 
securities be collateralized only by (or be collateralized by a certain 
percentage of) full recourse mortgage loans.
    (b) Definition.--The term ``Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio 
amendments'' means the amendments to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Common Sense 
Economic Recovery Act of 2013''.
    (b) Treatment of Certain Loans.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of determining capital 
        requirements or measuring capital of an insured depository 
        institution under section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
        Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o) or any other provision of law or 
        regulatory guidance, an insured depository institution that 
        would otherwise be required to treat a loan as a non-accrual 
        loan may treat such loan as an accrual loan, if--
                    (A) the loan is current;
                    (B) during the previous 6-month period, no monthly 
                payment on the loan has been more than 30 days 
                delinquent; and
                    (C) the payments on the loan are being made 
                pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
                and any refinances and modifications that are agreed to 
                by all of the parties.
            (2) Demonstration of ability to perform on a loan.--
        Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a modified or restructured loan 
        may not be treated as a non-accrual loan if the borrower 
        demonstrates the ability to perform on such a loan--
                    (A) over a period of 6 months; or
                    (B) with respect to a loan on a quarterly, semi-
                annual, or longer repayment schedule, over a period of

        loan held by an insured depository institution and treated as 
        an accrual loan by reason of paragraph (1), an appropriate 
        Federal banking agency may not impose any additional accounting 
        requirements on such institution with respect to such loan 
        compared to the requirements that would otherwise have been 
        placed on such institution with respect to such loan if such 
        loan were not being treated as an accrual loan by reason of 
        paragraph (1), if the result of such additional requirement 
        would adversely impact the measurement of capital of the 
        institution.
            (4) Prohibition on the re-classification of loans based 
        solely on collateral value.--An appropriate Federal banking 
        agency may not require an insured depository institution to 
        treat a loan as a non-accrual loan solely on the basis that the 
        collateral of such loan has reduced in value.
            (5) Provisions not applicable to publicly traded 
        institutions.--This subsection shall not apply with respect to

                Council in carrying out the study required under 
                paragraph (1); and
                    (B) legislative recommendations that the Council 
                believe will prevent contradictory guidance from being 
                issued by appropriate Federal banking agencies to 
                insured depository institutions with respect to loan 
                classifications and capital requirements.

        shall allocate the member directorships of the board of a 
        combined Bank among the States of the Bank district in 
        accordance with the requirements of subsection (c)(2), except 
        that--
                    ``(A) no State shall be allocated more than two

                allocated at least one member directorship; and
                    ``(B) if, after the Director has allocated all but 
                one of the member directorships, there remain any 
                States to which no member directorship has yet been 
                allocated, then the Director shall allocate the 
                remaining member directorship to represent the members 
                located in all of the States that have not otherwise 
                been allocated a member directorship.

        Bank shall be nominated and elected as provided in subsection 
        (b), except that, in the case of a member directorship that has 
        been designated as representing the members of two or more 
        States pursuant to paragraph (3)(B), the following requirements 
        shall apply in lieu of those set forth in subsection (b)(1)(A):

                shall be entitled to nominate an eligible person to 
                fill the directorship, and the member director shall be 
                elected from persons so nominated by a plurality of the

                may cast a number of votes equal to the number of 
                shares of stock in the Bank required to be held by the 
                member at the end of the calendar year next preceding
