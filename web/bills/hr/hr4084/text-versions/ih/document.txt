                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 to establish a 
        Community Gardens Pilot Program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Gardening and Nutrition 
Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) A community garden improves the quality of life, 
        encourages self-reliance, produces highly nutritious food, 
        reduces family food budgets, and creates opportunities for 
        recreation, social interaction, exercise, education, and 
        economic development for people participating in the garden.
            (2) The creation of community gardens has been an effective 
        approach to cleaning up and maintaining abandoned vacant lots.
            (3) Many community gardens donate fresh fruits and 
        vegetables to local food pantries, cooperatives, and homeless 
        members of the community, and provide for a source of fresh 
        fruits and vegetables for participants of the gardens.
            (4) An August 2013 report by the Union of Concerned 
        Scientists entitled ``The $11 Trillion Reward'' concluded that 
        if Americans were to eat 2.5 cups of vegetables and 2 cups of 
        fruit daily, as recommended by Federal dietary guidelines, 
        nearly 130,000 deaths could be prevented and $17 billion could 
        be saved in medical costs.
            (5) The Department of Health and Human Services recommends 
        eating more dark green vegetables, legumes, and fruits; and 
        eating fewer refined grains, less fat, and fewer calories.
            (6) A 2010 review of the Nutritional Implications of 
        Farmers' Markets and Community Gardens published by the Journal 
        of the American Dietetic Association found that community 
        gardens promote healthy behaviors.
            (7) A 2011 pilot study entitled ``LA Sprouts'' published by 
        the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that 
        teaching gardening and nutrition improved the dietary intakes 
        of children and reduced childhood obesity.
