Extends the pilot program for two years.\n\nRequires the Secretary to delegate to the directors of the national laboratories signature authority with respect to specified agreements of less than $1 million.\n\n Permits the directors of national laboratories to use funds authorized to support technology transfer within DOE to carry out early-stage and pre-commercial technology demonstration activities to: (1) remove technology barriers that limit private sector interest, and (2) demonstrate potential commercial applications of any research and technologies arising from national laboratory activities.\n\nAmends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to exempt institutions of higher education and nonprofit institutions from the cost-sharing requirements for research or development for six years.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to enable the participation of DOE researchers in the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps program.\n\nRequires a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO)."
