    ``(e) No Warranty.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any disclosure relating to participation 
        of a product in the Energy Star program shall not create an 
        express or implied warranty or give rise to any private claims 
        or rights of action under State or Federal law relating to the 
        disqualification of that product from Energy Star if--
                    ``(A) the product has been certified by a 
                certification body recognized by the Energy Star 
                program;
                    ``(B) the Administrator has approved corrective 
                measures, including a determination of whether or not 
                consumer compensation is appropriate; and

                all approved corrective measures.
            ``(2) Construal.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
        construed to require the Administrator to modify any procedure 
        or take any other action.''.
