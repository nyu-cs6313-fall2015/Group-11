                                 A BILL


 
   To amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to enter into contracts with health care providers to 
improve health care access and care coordination for veterans, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran-Centered 
Access to Coordinated Health Care Act of 2014''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) veterans who are authorized by the Secretary of 
        Veterans Affairs to receive health care in the community must 
        not lose the high quality, safety, care coordination, and other 
        veteran-centric elements that the health care system of the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs provides;
            (2) many veterans receive health care from both the 
        Department and community providers but the lack of care 
        coordination among the Department and community providers when 
        veterans receive purchased care places veterans at risk for 
        poor health outcomes and results in inefficient use of finite 
        health care resources;
            (3) veteran-centric care coordination is associated with 
        improved patient outcomes, as Department and non-Department 
        health care teams coordinate and collaborate to provide the 
        best care for veterans; and
            (4) if the Secretary purchases care for veterans from the 
        private sector, such care must be secured in a cost-effective 
        manner, in a way that complements the larger health care system 
        of the Department by using industry standards for care and 
        costs.

SEC. 2. COMPREHENSIVE CONTRACT CARE COORDINATION PROGRAM FOR VETERANS.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) Type of care.--Subsection (a) of section 1703 of title 
        38, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
    ``(a)(1) The Secretary shall provide an eligible veteran with 
covered health services that are provided by a non-Department entity 
whom the Secretary enters into a contract with under this section if 
the Secretary determines that facilities of the Department are not 
capable of--
            ``(A) economically furnishing covered health services to 
        such veteran because of geographical inaccessibility; or
            ``(B) furnishing covered health services to such veteran 
        because such facilities lack--
                    ``(i) the required personnel who are appropriately 
                trained and experienced; or
                    ``(ii) the ability to provide timely and reasonable 
                access.
    ``(2) Except as otherwise provided by this chapter or other law,

    ``(5) In this subsection:
            ``(A) The term `covered health services' means, with 
        respect to an eligible veteran, any hospital care, medical 
        service, rehabilitative service, or preventative health service 
        that is authorized to be provided by the Secretary to the 
        veteran under this chapter or any other provision of law.
            ``(B) The term `eligible veteran' means a veteran enrolled 
        in the health care system established under section 1705(a) of 
        this title who elects to receive care under this section.''.
            (2) Qualified entities; care coordination.--Such section is 
        amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:
