SEC. 2. FINDINGS; POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Support for human rights is the cornerstone of American 
        foreign policy, and the advance of women's rights and the 
        advance of liberty are ultimately inseparable.
            (2) A number of international human rights instruments, as 
        well as several international declarations, have recognized the 
        equal rights of men and women and articulated specific aspects 
        of women's human rights, including the Universal Declaration of 
        Human Rights, the Charter of the United Nations, the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
        International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
        the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of 
        Discrimination against Women, the Inter-American Convention on 
        the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence Against 
        Women, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against 
        Women, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.
            (3) Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
        recognizes that ``all human beings are born free and equal in 
        dignity and rights'', and Article 7 recognizes that ``all are 
        equal before the law and are entitled without any 
        discrimination to equal protection of the law''. Article 3 of 
        the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
        recognizes that the State Parties to the Covenant ``undertake 
        to ensure the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of 
        all civil and political rights set forth in the Covenant''. 
        Article 26 of the Covenant provides that ``all persons are 
        equal before the law and are entitled without any 
        discrimination to the equal protection of the law. In this 
        respect, the laws of each State Party shall prohibit any 
        discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective 
        protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, 
        color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
        national or social origin, property, birth or other status''. 
        The Preamble of the Charter of the United Nations affirms the 
        equal rights of men and women. Governments have the 
        responsibility to protect the fundamental rights of their 
        citizens and to pursue justice for all. Women's rights are 
        fundamental rights, regardless of race, country, creed, or 
        nationality, and should never be arbitrarily abridged by any 
        government.
            (4) Barbaric treatment of women persists in many parts of 
        the world. Women suffer both government-sponsored and 
        government-tolerated violations of their human rights. In 
        countries where women are subject to particularly severe 
        restrictions, women cannot work outside the home, cannot attend 
        schools or universities, cannot drive, cannot leave the home 
        without a male companion, may only use segregated 
        transportation, cannot obtain a passport or travel without the 
        permission of a male relative, must wear particular clothing, 
        must black out house windows in public view, cannot obtain 
        quality health education, and have limited access to health 
        care because a male relative must be present or because male 
        doctors are not allowed to touch female patients. The ``In-
        depth study on all forms of violence against women'' conducted 
        by the Secretary General of the United Nations found that in 
        many countries, women's economic opportunities are severely 
        limited because of discrimination in employment, property 
        rights, and access to resources. These inequalities work to 
        limit women's independence and make them more vulnerable to 
        further discrimination, including violence.
            (5) Violence against women is a form of discrimination 
        which is pervasive throughout all parts of the world. In many 
        countries, governments condone or perpetrate violence against 
        women. Women are subject to various manifestations of brutal 
        violence, including female genital mutilation, honor killings, 
        domestic violence, gender-based murders, rape, trafficking, 
        forced early marriage, and the maltreatment of widows. 
        Perpetration of violence by the country can include custodial 
        violence, forced sterilization, sexual violence during armed 
        conflict, and policies on forced pregnancy and forced abortion. 
        Violence against women has consequences for their health and 
        well-being, their economic security, and the economic 
        development of their communities and countries.
            (6) Though not confined to a particular region or regime, 
        violations of women's rights are often particularly widespread, 
        systematic, and heinous under totalitarian governments and in 
        countries with militant, politicized religious majorities or 
        with strong tribal traditions.
            (7) Congress has recognized and denounced international 
        violations of women's rights through the adoption of the 
        following resolutions:
                    (A) Senate Resolution 68 of the 106th Congress, 
                expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the 
                treatment of women and girls by the Taliban in 
                Afghanistan.
                    (B) Senate Concurrent Resolution 42 of the 107th 
                Congress, condemning the Taliban for their 
                discriminatory policies towards women.
                    (C) Senate Concurrent Resolution 86 of the 107th 
                Congress, expressing the sense of Congress that women 
                from all ethnic groups in Afghanistan should 
                participate in the economic and political 
                reconstruction of Afghanistan.
                    (D) House Resolution 393 of the 108th Congress, 
                commending Afghan women for their participation in 
                Afghan government and civil society, encouraging the 
                inclusion of Afghan women in the political and economic 
                life of Afghanistan, and advocating the protection of 
                the human rights of all Afghans, particularly women, in 
                the Afghanistan Constitution.
                    (E) Senate Resolution 74 of the 109th Congress, 
                designating March 8, 2005, as International Women's 
                Day.
    (b) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States to do the 
following:
            (1) To condemn violations of women's rights, and to 
        promote, and to assist other governments in promoting, the 
        fundamental human rights of women.
            (2) To seek to channel United States security and 
        development assistance to governments other than those found to 
        be engaged in gross violations of the rights of women, as set 
        forth in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, in the 
        International Financial Institutions Act, and in other 
        formulations of United States human rights policy.
            (3) To be vigorous and flexible, reflecting both the 
        unwavering commitment of the United States to women's rights 
        and the desire of the United States for the most effective and 
        principled response, in light of the range of violations of 
        women's rights by a variety of persecuting regimes, and the 
        status of the relations of the United States with different 
        nations.
            (4) To work with foreign governments that affirm and 
        protect women's rights, in order to develop multilateral 
        documents and initiatives to combat violations of women's 
        rights and promote the right of women to enjoy their human 
        rights abroad.
            (5) Standing for liberty and standing with the 
        disadvantaged, to use and implement appropriate tools in the 
        United States foreign policy apparatus, including diplomatic, 
        political, commercial, charitable, educational, and cultural 
        channels, to promote respect for women's rights by all 
        governments and peoples.

                Commissioner or employee has reason to believe that the 
                gift was provided because of the Commissioner's 
                position and not because of the personal friendship.

the staff of the National Security Council a Special Adviser to the 
President on International Women's Rights, whose position should be 
comparable to that of a director within the Executive Office of the 
President. The Special Adviser should serve as a resource for executive 
branch officials, compiling and maintaining information on the facts 
and circumstances of violations of women's rights (as defined in 
section 3 of the International Women's Freedom Act of 2013), and making 
policy recommendations. The Special Adviser should serve as liaison 
with the Ambassador at Large for International Women's Rights, the 
United States Commission on International Women's Rights, the Congress, 
and, as advisable, women's nongovernmental organizations.''.

                that country during the preceding 12 months or since

        instrumentality and specific officials of the government that 
        are responsible for the particularly severe violations of 
        women's rights engaged in or tolerated by that government in 
        order to appropriately target Presidential actions under this 
        section in response to the violations.

        before the date that the President is required (but for this 
        paragraph) to take action under paragraph (1), the President 
        determines and certifies to the Congress that a single, 
        additional period of time not to exceed 90 days is necessary--
                    (A) for a continuation of negotiations that have 
                been commenced with the government of that country to 
                bring about a cessation of the violations by the 
                foreign country,
                    (B) for a continuation of multilateral negotiations 
                into which the United States has entered to bring about 
                a cessation of the violations by the foreign country, 
                or
                    (C)(i) for a review of corrective action taken by 
                the foreign country after designation of that country 
                as a country of particular concern, or
                    (ii) in anticipation that corrective action will be 
                taken by the foreign country during that additional 
                period of time,
        then the President shall not be required to take action until

            (4) Exception for ongoing presidential action under this 
        act.--The President shall not be required to take action under 
        this subsection in the case of a country of particular concern 
        for women's rights, if, with respect to that country--
                    (A) the President has taken action pursuant to this 
                Act in a preceding year;
                    (B) such action is in effect at the time the 
                country is designated as a country of particular 
                concern for women's rights under this section; and
                    (C) the President reports to the Congress the 
                information described in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and

                with respect to that country.
            (5) Exception for ongoing multiple broad-based sanctions in 
        response to human rights violations.--If, at the time the 
        President determines a country to be a country of particular 
        concern for women's rights, that country is already subject to 
        multiple, broad-based sanctions imposed in significant part in 
        response to human rights abuses, and such sanctions are 
        ongoing, the President may determine that one or more of these 
        sanctions also satisfies the requirements of this subsection. 
        In the report to the Congress under section 404(a), and, as 
        applicable, in the information published under section 408, the 
        President shall designate the specific sanction or sanctions 
        which the President determines satisfy the requirements of this 
        subsection. The sanctions so designated shall remain in effect 
        as provided in section 409.
    (d) Statutory Construction.--A determination under this Act, or any 
amendment made by this Act, that a foreign country has engaged in or 
tolerated particularly severe violations of women's rights shall not be 
construed to require the termination of assistance or other activities 
with respect to that country under any other provision of law, 
including section 116 or 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
U.S.C. 2151n, 2304).

women's rights, or not later than 90 days after the President

                particular concern for women's rights, or to 
                Presidential action under section 401, as the case may 
                be; and

        it to be appropriate, consultations under paragraph (1) may be 
        sought and may occur in a multilateral forum, but, in any 
        event, the President shall consult with appropriate foreign 
        governments for the purposes of achieving a coordinated 
        international policy on actions that may be taken with respect 
        to a country described in subsection (a), before implementing

        If negotiations are undertaken or an agreement is concluded 
        with a foreign government regarding steps to cease the pattern 
        of violations by that government, and if public disclosure of 
        such negotiations or agreement would jeopardize the 
        negotiations or the implementation of such agreement, as the 
        case may be, the President may refrain from disclosing such 
        negotiations and such agreement to the public, except that the

        of the nature and extent of such negotiations and any agreement 
        reached.

        the United States should make a priority of promoting and

        cultural respect for women's rights.
