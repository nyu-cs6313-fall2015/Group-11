                                 AN ACT


 
 To require that, if the President's fiscal year 2014 budget does not 
achieve balance in a fiscal year covered by such budget, the President 
  shall submit a supplemental unified budget by April 1, 2013, which 
 identifies a fiscal year in which balance is achieved, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Require Presidential Leadership and 
No Deficit Act'' or the ``Require a PLAN Act''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require the President 
to submit to Congress a supplemental unified budget if the President's 
budget for fiscal year 2014 does not achieve balance in a fiscal year 
covered by such budget.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) With this year's expected failure to meet the statutory 
        deadline for submission of his budget, as stated by the Office 
        of Management and Budget, the President will have only met the 
        statutory deadline in one of his five budget submissions.
            (2) Despite a promise to cut the deficit in half, the 
        deficit doubled during the President's first year in office and 
        has exceeded $1 trillion for four years now.
            (3) Since taking office, the President has allowed the 
        Federal debt to grow by nearly $6 trillion and total debt now 
        exceeds the size of the entire economy of the United States.
            (4) Under the President's most recent budget submission, 
        the budget never achieves balance.
            (5) The President's fiscal year 2013 budget submission 
        includes the admission that under his own policies the Federal 
        Government's ``fiscal position gradually deteriorates''.

SEC. 3. SUBMISSION OF A SUPPLEMENTAL UNIFIED BUDGET.

    (a) In General.--If the President's budget for fiscal year 2014, 
submitted to Congress pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United 
States Code, results in a projected deficit in every fiscal year for 
which estimates are provided in such budget, then the President shall 
submit a supplemental unified budget pursuant to subsection (b).
    (b) Contents of Supplemental Unified Budget.--Not later than April 
1, 2013, the President shall submit to Congress a supplemental unified 
budget that includes--
            (1) the information required under section 1105(a) of title 
        31, United States Code;
            (2) an estimate of the earliest fiscal year in which the 
        supplemental budget is not projected to result in a deficit;
            (3) a detailed description of additional policies to be 
        implemented in order to achieve such result (including an 
        evaluation of duplicative agency functions and agency 
        effectiveness, and proposals for consolidating duplicative 
        functions and programs between agencies in the interests of 
        cost-savings);
            (4) an explanation of the differences between the 
        President's budget for fiscal year 2014 and the supplemental 
        unified budget referred to in this subsection;
            (5) an estimate of the cost per taxpayer of the annual 
        deficit for each year in which the supplemental unified budget 
        is projected to result in a deficit; and
            (6) under a separate heading entitled ``Direct Spending'', 
        which shall include a category for ``Means-Tested Direct 
        Spending'' and a category for ``Nonmeans-Tested Direct 
        Spending'' and sets forth--
                    (A) the average rate of growth for each category in 
                the total amount of outlays during the 10-year period 
                preceding the budget year;
                    (B) information on the budget proposals for reform 
                of such programs;
                    (C) a description of programs which shall be 
                considered means-tested direct spending and nonmeans-
                tested direct spending for purposes of this paragraph; 
                and
                    (D) an annual estimate of the total amount of 
                outlays for each such program for the period covered by 
                the budget proposal.
    (c) Definition.--The term ``unified budget'' means the total level 
of outlays, total level of receipts, and the resulting deficit or 
surplus of the United States Government for a fiscal year.

            Passed the House of Representatives February 6, 2013.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
