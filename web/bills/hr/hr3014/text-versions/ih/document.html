false statement by reason of the failure of the individual to recite or 
acknowledge such arrest or institution of criminal proceedings, or 
results thereof, in response to an inquiry made of the individual for 
any purpose. The fact that such individual has been convicted of the 
nonviolent offense concerned shall not operate as a disqualification of
