  <summary>7/28/2014--Passed House amended.
North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2014 - Title I: Investigations, Prohibited Conduct, and Penalties - (Sec. 102) Directs the President, upon receipt of credible information about sanctionable activities involving the government of North Korea, to investigate the possible designation for sanctions of any person knowingly engaged in certain transactions with that government (including an individual, a corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, financial institution, insurer, underwriter, guarantor, and any other business organization, any other nongovernmental entity, organization, or group, and any governmental entity operating as a business enterprise).

(Sec. 103) Requires the President to brief appropriate congressional committees, within 180 days after enactment of this Act, on efforts to implement it.

(Sec. 104) Directs the President to designate for sanctions any person that has knowingly:

 engaged in significant activities or transactions with North Korea that have materially contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or missiles and other means of delivery of WMD, including any efforts to manufacture, acquire, possess, develop, transport, transfer, or use such items; imported, exported, or reexported to, into, or from North Korea any arms or related materiel, whether directly or indirectly; provided significant training, advice, or other services or assistance, or engaged in transactions, related to the manufacture, maintenance, or use of any arms or related materiel to be imported, exported, or reexported to, into, or from North Korea, whether directly or indirectly; imported, exported, or reexported, directly or indirectly, significant luxury goods to or into North Korea;\ engaged in or been responsible for censorship or serious human rights abuses by North Korea; engaged in significant acts of money laundering, the counterfeiting of goods or currency, bulk cash smuggling, narcotics trafficking, or other illicit activity that involves or supports North Korea; or attempted to engage in any of these activities. Requires the President to apply sanctions under this Act and exercise the authorities of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to block all property and interests in property of any person designated under this Act that are in the United States, come within the United States, or are or come within the possession or control of any U.S. person, including any overseas branch.

Sets forth civil and criminal penalties under IEEPA.

Authorizes the President to designate and apply sanctions to any person that has knowingly engaged in, contributed to, or otherwise supported specified financial or related activities relating to any violation of, or evasion of, an applicable United Nations (U.N.) Security Council resolution, particularly one dealing with North Korea.

Directs the President to exercise IEEPA authorities to block all property and interests in property of the government of North Korea that are in the United States, come within the United States, or are or come within the possession or control of any U.S. person, including any overseas branch.

(Sec. 105) Subjects to forfeiture to the United States any property, real or personal, involved in an actual or attempted violation of this Act, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to a violation, of it.

Title II: Sanctions Against North Korean Proliferation, Human Rights Abuses, and Illicit Activities - (Sec. 201) Declares the sense of Congress regarding designation of North Korea as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.

Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) determine whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is such a jurisdiction, and, if so, (2) impose one or more special measures with respect to it.

(Sec. 202) Expresses the sense of Congress that the President should intensify diplomatic efforts, both in international fora such as the U.N. and bilaterally, to develop and implement a coordinated, consistent, multilateral strategy for protecting the global financial system against risks emanating from North Korea.

(Sec. 203) Requires a license for export to North Korea of any goods or technology subject to the Export Administration Regulations without regard to whether North Korea has been designated a country whose government has supported acts of international terrorism. Subjects any license, however, to a presumption of denial.

Applies certain prohibitions and restrictions of the Arms Export Control Act to exporting or otherwise providing, directly or indirectly, any munitions item to North Korea without regard to whether or not it is designated a state sponsor of terrorism.
