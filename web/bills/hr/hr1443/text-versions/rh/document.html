SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since 2006, the most prevalent service-connected 
        disability for which veterans have received compensation under 
        the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has 
        been tinnitus.
            (2) The number of veterans receiving such compensation for 
        tinnitus has risen each year since 2006, increasing the number 
        and cost of the compensation claims paid by the Secretary.
            (3) A growing body of peer reviewed literature indicates a 
        direct connection between traumatic brain injury, post 
        traumatic stress disorder, and tinnitus.
            (4) An analysis of data collected by the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs concluded that total amount of disability 
        compensation paid for tinnitus by the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs in 2012 was $1,500,000,000.
            (5) Based on projected rates of growth, the amount of 
        disability compensation payable to veterans for tinnitus is 
        expected to exceed $3,000,000,000 in 2017.

SEC. 3. RECOGNITION AND TREATMENT OF TINNITUS AT DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS 
              AFFAIRS AUDITORY CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE.

condition for research and treatment by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs Auditory Centers of Excellence.

SEC. 4. RESEARCH ON PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF TINNITUS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall recognize 
the need to enhance the research and treatment of tinnitus and to 
ensure the allocation of appropriate resources directed at the research 
and enhanced treatment of tinnitus conducted by the Auditory Centers of 
Excellence of the Department of Veterans Affairs, commensurate with 
peer-review protocols. Such research shall include--
            (1) an assessment of the efficacy of multidisciplinary 
        tinnitus treatment modalities on different subsets of patients;
            (2) studies on the underlying etiology of tinnitus in 
        veteran populations that occur as a result of different causal 
        factors, including blast-related tinnitus where there is no 
        measurable hearing loss versus other forms of noise-induced 
        tinnitus where there is hearing loss; and
            (3) a study of the underlying mechanisms between hearing 
        loss and tinnitus, including cases in which one or the other 
        condition is present, but not both.
    (b) Relationship to Other Authorities.--Nothing in this section 
shall be construed as interfering with the discretion of the Secretary
