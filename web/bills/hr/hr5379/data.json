    "text": "China Human Rights Protection Act of 2014 - Directs the President to submit to Congress a list (with updates) of individuals responsible for, or complicit in, the commission of:\n\n serious and ongoing violations of human rights against nationals of China or their family members, regardless of whether such abuses occurred in China; and gross violations of human rights against nationals of China or their family members, regardless of whether such abuses occurred in China, or who have benefitted materially or financially from such actions. Requires the President to impose: (1) U.S. entry and financial sanctions on listed individuals, and (2) additional sanctions on individuals listed for two and three years.\n\nStates that entry, financial, and U.S. program benefits sanctions shall not apply if necessary to permit the United States to comply with the Agreement regarding the Headquarters of the United Nations or other applicable international obligations. Requires congressional notification.\n\nAuthorizes the President to terminate sanctions against an individual under specified circumstances.\n\nSets forth related penalty requirements.\n\nAmends the Immigration and Nationality Act to authorize the refusal of a nonimmigrant I-visa (foreign media representative) to aliens who are executives at a state-controlled media organization from China if any U.S. media personnel were expelled, had visas denied, or faced intimidation or violence working in China during the prior fiscal year.\n\nDirects the President to order the revocation, delay, or refusal of a sufficient number of visas already issued to executives of state-controlled media organizations from China in proportion to the expulsions, visa delays or denials, and intimidation experienced by personnel from U.S. journalist or media organizations in the previous 12 months.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that:\n\n restrictions on the activities of U.S. journalists and media personnel in China and the censorship and blockage of news media websites damages the competitiveness of U.S. media corporations and should be considered a trade restriction and an unfair competitive advantage benefitting Chinese government-controlled media organizations; and the U.S. government should link to any bilateral investment treaty currently being negotiated language that guarantees fair treatment of journalists, a reciprocal number of journalist visas, and free and unfettered operation of news websites in China."
