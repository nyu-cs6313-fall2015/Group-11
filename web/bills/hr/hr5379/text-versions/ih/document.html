            ``(1) In general.--In the case of aliens who are executives 
        at a state-controlled media organization from the People's 
        Republic of China and are seeking classification under section 
        101(a)(15)(I), the visas may be refused to such aliens if any 
        United States media personnel were expelled, had visas denied, 
        or faced intimidation or violence in the course of working in 
        China in the prior fiscal year.
            ``(2) Visas to such aliens, in proportion to the 
        expulsions, visa denials or delays experienced by U.S. 
        journalists or media personnel working in China during the 
        prior fiscal year, may be refused or delayed.
            ``(3) For purposes of this subsection--
                    ``(A) the term `state-controlled media worker from 
                the People's Republic of China' means a representative 
                of a media organization owned, operated, or controlled 
                by the People's Republic of China, including--
                            ``(i) China Central Television;
                            ``(ii) China Daily;
                            ``(iii) China National Radio;

                            ``(vi) China Youth Daily;
                            ``(vii) Economic Daily;
                            ``(viii) Global Times;
                            ``(ix) Guangming Daily;
                            ``(x) Legal Daily;
                            ``(xi) Liberation Army Daily;
                            ``(xii) People's Daily; or
                            ``(xiii) Xinhua News Agency.
                    ``(B) Revocation of certain visas; nonimmigrant 
                status.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the 
                enactment of this section, the President shall order 
                the revocation, delay, or refusal of a sufficient 
                number of visas already issued to executives of state-
                controlled media organizations from the People's 
                Republic of China in proportion to the expulsions, visa 
                delays or denials, and intimidation experienced by 
                personnel from U.S. journalist or media personnel 
                organizations in the previous 12 months prior to the 
                Act's passage.
                    ``(C) Reporting on restrictions on foreign media in 
                china.--The Department of State, in the Annual Country 
                Reports on Human Rights Conditions shall include 
                information and details on intimidation, travel 
                restrictions, visa denials and delays, and expulsions 
                of foreign media personnel from China and the censoring 
                and blocking of media corporations' Web sites within 
                China.
                    ``(D) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of 
                Congress that restrictions on the activities of U.S. 
                journalists and media personnel in China and the 
                censorship and blockage of news media Web sites damages 
                the competitiveness of U.S. media corporations and 
                should be considered a restriction of trade and an 
                unfair competitive advantage benefitting Chinese 
                government-controlled media organizations. As such, the 
                U.S. Government should link to any bilateral investment 
                treaty, currently being negotiated, language that 
                guarantees fair treatment of journalists, a reciprocal 
                number of journalist visas, and free and unfettered 
                operation of news Web sites in China.''.
