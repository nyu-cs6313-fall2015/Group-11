                                 A BILL


 
 To delay implementation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lower Electric Bill Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Certain Environmental Protection Agency environmental 
        regulations are issued without any economic impact analysis 
        that takes into consideration the costs to comply with such 
        regulations and the impact of such regulations on the local 
        economy and jobs.
            (2) Certain Environmental Protection Agency environmental 
        regulations are issued without any analysis of the feasibility 
        of compliance with deadlines.
            (3) It will cost local communities billions of dollars to 
        comply with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.
            (4) Communities throughout the Nation will therefore face 
        large increases in their electric utility bills, on top of 
        rising water and wastewater bills, and in some cases these 
        increases in electricity bills could be nearly 20 percent.
            (5) The economic impact of such Standards has the potential 
        to be devastating, especially in communities with a high 
        percentage of residents living at or below the poverty line, a 
        factor which is not considered in cost/benefit analyses.
            (6) Higher energy costs also threaten all types of 
        businesses, including manufacturing and other industries that 
        employ thousands throughout the Nation.

SEC. 3. DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MERCURY AND AIR TOXICS STANDARDS.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Administrator of 
the Environmental Protection Agency may not implement, administer, or 
enforce the emission standards for hazardous air pollutants from coal- 
and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units established 
pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412) and 
promulgated in the final rule entitled ``National Emission Standards 
for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility 
Steam Generating Units and Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-
Fired Electric Utility, Industrial-Commercial-Institutional, and Small 
Industrial-Commercial-Institutional Steam Generating Units'', published 
at 77 Fed. Reg. 9304 (February 16, 2012), or any revisions or 
supplements thereto before the later of--
            (1) the date that is 5 years after the date of enactment of 
        this Act; and
            (2) the date on which the Administrator completes a study 
        on the economic impacts of such standards on local communities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
