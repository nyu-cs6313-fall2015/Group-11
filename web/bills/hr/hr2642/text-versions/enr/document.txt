                2012 crop years to that covered commodity because of 
                drought, flood, or other natural disaster, or other 
                condition beyond the control of the producers, as 
                determined by the Secretary; to

                (ii) the 4-year average of--

                    (I) the acreage planted on the farm to all covered 
                commodities for harvest, grazing, haying, silage, or 
                other similar purposes for such crop years; and
                    (II) any acreage on the farm that the producers 
                were prevented from planting during such crop years to 
                covered commodities because of drought, flood, or other 
                natural disaster, or other condition beyond the control 
                of the producers, as determined by the Secretary.

            (C) Treatment of generic base acres.--Generic base acres 
        are retained and may not be reallocated under this paragraph.
            (D) Inclusion of all 4 years in average.--For the purpose 
        of determining a 4-year acreage average under subparagraph (B) 
        for a farm, the Secretary shall not exclude any crop year in 
        which a covered commodity was not planted.
            (E) Treatment of multiple planting or prevented planting.--
        For the purpose of determining under subparagraph (B) the 
        acreage on a farm that producers planted or were prevented from 
        planting during the 2009 through 2012 crop years to covered 
        commodities, if the acreage that was planted or prevented from 
        being planted was devoted to another covered commodity in the 
        same crop year (other than a covered commodity produced under 
        an established practice of double cropping), the owner may 
        elect the commodity to be used for that crop year in 
        determining the 4-year average, but may not include both the 
        initial commodity and the subsequent commodity.
            (F) Limitation.--The reallocation of base acres among 
        covered commodities on a farm under this paragraph may not 
        result in a total number of base acres (including generic base 
        acres) for the farm in excess of the number of base acres in 
        effect for the farm on September 30, 2013.
        (4) Application of election to all covered commodities.--The 
    election made under this subsection, or deemed to be made under 
    paragraph (1)(C), with respect to a farm shall apply to all of the 
    covered commodities on the farm.
    (b) Adjustment of Base Acres.--
        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding the election made under 
    subsection (a), the Secretary shall provide for an adjustment, as 
    appropriate, in the base acres for covered commodities for a farm 
    and any generic base acres for the farm whenever any of the 
    following circumstances occur:
            (A) A conservation reserve contract entered into under 
        section 1231 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831) 
        with respect to the farm expires or is voluntarily terminated.
            (B) Cropland is released from coverage under a conservation 
        reserve contract by the Secretary.
            (C) The producer has eligible oilseed acreage as the result 
        of the Secretary designating additional oilseeds, which shall 
        be determined in the same manner as eligible oilseed acreage 
        under section 1101(a)(1)(D) of the Food, Conservation, and 
        Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8711(a)(1)(D)).
        (2) Special conservation reserve acreage payment rules.--For 
    the crop year in which a base acres adjustment under subparagraph 
    (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) is first made, the owner of the farm 
    shall elect to receive price loss coverage or agriculture risk 
    coverage with respect to the acreage added to the farm under this 
    subsection or a prorated payment under the conservation reserve 
    contract, but not both.
    (c) Prevention of Excess Base Acres.--
        (1) Required reduction.--Notwithstanding the election made 
    under subsection (a), if the sum of the base acres for a farm, 
    including generic base acres, and the acreage described in 
    paragraph (2) exceeds the actual cropland acreage of the farm, the 
    Secretary shall reduce the base acres for 1 or more covered 
    commodities or generic base acres for the farm so that the sum of 
    the base acres, including generic base acres, and the acreage 
    described in paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual cropland 
    acreage of the farm.
        (2) Other acreage.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
    Secretary shall include the following:
            (A) Any acreage on the farm enrolled in the conservation 
        reserve program or wetlands reserve program (or successor 
        programs) under chapter 1 of subtitle D of title XII of the 
        Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3830 et seq.).
            (B) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a Federal 
        conservation program for which payments are made in exchange 
        for not producing an agricultural commodity on the acreage.
            (C) If the Secretary designates additional oilseeds, any 
        eligible oilseed acreage, which shall be determined in the same 
        manner as eligible oilseed acreage under subsection (b)(1)(C).
        (3) Selection of acres.--The Secretary shall give the owner of 
    the farm the opportunity to select the base acres for a covered 
    commodity or generic base acres for the farm against which the 
    reduction required by paragraph (1) will be made.
        (4) Exception for double-cropped acreage.--In applying 
    paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make an exception in the case of 
    double cropping, as determined by the Secretary.
    (d) Reduction in Base Acres.--
        (1) Reduction at option of owner.--
            (A) In general.--The owner of a farm may reduce, at any 
        time, the base acres for any covered commodity or generic base 
        acres for the farm.
            (B) Effect of reduction.--A reduction under subparagraph 
        (A) shall be permanent and made in a manner prescribed by the 
        Secretary.
        (2) Required action by secretary.--
            (A) In general.--The Secretary shall proportionately reduce 
        base acres, including any generic base acres, on a farm for 
        land that has been subdivided and developed for multiple 
        residential units or other nonfarming uses if the size of the 
        tracts and the density of the subdivision is such that the land 
        is unlikely to return to the previous agricultural use, unless 
        the producers on the farm demonstrate that the land--
                (i) remains devoted to commercial agricultural 
            production; or
                (ii) is likely to be returned to the previous 
            agricultural use.
            (B) Requirement.--The Secretary shall establish procedures 
        to identify land described in subparagraph (A).
SEC. 1113. PAYMENT YIELDS.
    (a) Establishment and Purpose.--For the purpose of making price 
loss coverage payments under section 1116, the Secretary shall provide 
for the establishment of a yield for each farm for any designated 
oilseed for which a payment yield was not established under section 
1102 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8712) 
in accordance with this section.
    (b) Payment Yields for Designated Oilseeds.--
        (1) Determination of average yield.--In the case of designated 
    oilseeds, the Secretary shall determine the average yield per 
    planted acre for the designated oilseed on a farm for the 1998 
    through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in which the 
    acreage planted to the designated oilseed was zero.
        (2) Adjustment for payment yield.--
            (A) In general.--The payment yield for a farm for a 
        designated oilseed shall be equal to the product of the 
        following:
                (i) The average yield for the designated oilseed 
            determined under paragraph (1).
                (ii) The ratio resulting from dividing the national 
            average yield for the designated oilseed for the 1981 
            through 1985 crops by the national average yield for the 
            designated oilseed for the 1998 through 2001 crops.
            (B) No national average yield information available.--To 
        the extent that national average yield information for a 
        designated oilseed is not available, the Secretary shall use 
        such information as the Secretary determines to be fair and 
        equitable to establish a national average yield under this 
        section.
        (3) Use of county average yield.--If the yield per planted acre 
    for a crop of a designated oilseed for a farm for any of the 1998 
    through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent of the county 
    yield for that designated oilseed, the Secretary shall assign a 
    yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of the county yield 
    for the purpose of determining the average under paragraph (1).
    (c) Effect of Lack of Payment Yield.--
        (1) Establishment by secretary.--In the case of a covered 
    commodity on a farm for which base acres have been established or 
    that is planted on generic base acres, if no payment yield is 
    otherwise established for the covered commodity on the farm, the 
    Secretary shall establish an appropriate payment yield for the 
    covered commodity on the farm under paragraph (2).
        (2) Use of similarly situated farms.--To establish an 
    appropriate payment yield for a covered commodity on a farm as 
    required by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take into 
    consideration the farm program payment yields applicable to that 
    covered commodity for similarly situated farms. The use of such 
    data in an appeal, by the Secretary or by the producer, shall not 
    be subject to any other provision of law.
    (d) Single Opportunity To Update Yields Used To Determine Price 
Loss Coverage Payments.--
        (1) Election to update.--At the sole discretion of the owner of 
    a farm, the owner of a farm shall have a 1-time opportunity to 
    update, on a covered commodity-by-covered-commodity basis, the 
    payment yield that would otherwise be used in calculating any price 
    loss coverage payment for each covered commodity on the farm for 
    which the election is made.
        (2) Time for election.--The election under paragraph (1) shall 
    be made at a time and manner to be in effect beginning with the 
    2014 crop year as determined by the Secretary.
        (3) Method of updating yields.--If the owner of a farm elects 
    to update yields under this subsection, the payment yield for a 
    covered commodity on the farm, for the purpose of calculating price 
    loss coverage payments only, shall be equal to 90 percent of the 
    average of the yield per planted acre for the crop of the covered 
    commodity on the farm for the 2008 through 2012 crop years, as 
    determined by the Secretary, excluding any crop year in which the 
    acreage planted to the crop of the covered commodity was zero.
        (4) Use of county average yield.--If the yield per planted acre 
    for a crop of the covered commodity for a farm for any of the 2008 
    through 2012 crop years was less than 75 percent of the average of 
    the 2008 through 2012 county yield for that commodity, the 
    Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75 
    percent of the average of the 2008 through 2012 county yield for 
    the purposes of determining the average yield under paragraph (3).
SEC. 1114. PAYMENT ACRES.
    (a) Determination of Payment Acres.--
        (1) General rule.--For the purpose of price loss coverage and 
    agriculture risk coverage when county coverage has been selected 
    under section 1115(b)(1), but subject to subsection (e), the 
    payment acres for each covered commodity on a farm shall be equal 
    to 85 percent of the base acres for the covered commodity on the 
    farm.
        (2) Effect of individual coverage.--In the case of agriculture 
    risk coverage when individual coverage has been selected under 
    section 1115(b)(2), but subject to subsection (e), the payment 
    acres for a farm shall be equal to 65 percent of the base acres for 
    all of the covered commodities on the farm.
    (b) Treatment of Generic Base Acres.--
        (1) In general.--In the case of generic base acres, price loss 
    coverage payments and agriculture risk coverage payments are made 
    only with respect to generic base acres planted to a covered 
    commodity for the crop year.
        (2) Attribution.--With respect to a farm containing generic 
    base acres, for the purpose of applying paragraphs (1)(B) and 
    (2)(B) of subsection (a), generic base acres on the farm are 
    attributed to a covered commodity in the following manner:
            (A) If a single covered commodity is planted and the total 
        acreage planted exceeds the generic base acres on the farm, the 
        generic base acres are attributed to that covered commodity in 
        an amount equal to the total number of generic base acres.
            (B) If multiple covered commodities are planted and the 
        total number of acres planted to all covered commodities on the 
        farm exceeds the generic base acres on the farm, the generic 
        base acres are attributed to each of the covered commodities on 
        the farm on a pro rata basis to reflect the ratio of--
                (i) the acreage planted to a covered commodity on the 
            farm; to
                (ii) the total acreage planted to all covered 
            commodities on the farm.
            (C) If the total number of acres planted to all covered 
        commodities on the farm does not exceed the generic base acres 
        on the farm, the number of acres planted to a covered commodity 
        is attributed to that covered commodity.
        (3) Treated as additional acreage.--When generic base acres are 
    planted to a covered commodity or acreage planted to a covered 
    commodity is attributed to generic base acres, the generic base 
    acres are in addition to other base acres on the farm.
    (c) Exclusion.--The quantity of payment acres determined under 
subsection (a) may not include any crop subsequently planted during the 
same crop year on the same land for which the first crop is eligible 
for price loss coverage payments or agriculture risk coverage payments, 
unless the crop was approved for double cropping in the county, as 
determined by the Secretary.
    (d) Effect of Minimal Payment Acres.--
        (1) Prohibition on payments.--Notwithstanding any other 
    provision of this title, a producer on a farm may not receive price 
    loss coverage payments or agriculture risk coverage payments if the 
    sum of the base acres on the farm is 10 acres or less, as 
    determined by the Secretary.
        (2) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) does not apply to a producer 
    that is--
            (A) a socially disadvantaged farmer or rancher (as defined 
        in section 355(e) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural 
        Development Act (7 U.S.C. 2003(e))); or
            (B) a limited resource farmer or rancher, as defined by the 
        Secretary.
    (e) Effect of Planting Fruits and Vegetables.--
        (1) Reduction required.--In the manner provided in this 
    subsection, payment acres on a farm shall be reduced in any crop 
    year in which fruits, vegetables (other than mung beans and pulse 
    crops), or wild rice have been planted on base acres on a farm.
        (2) Price loss coverage and county coverage.--In the case of 
    price loss coverage payments and agricultural risk coverage 
    payments using county coverage, the reduction under paragraph (1) 
    shall be the amount equal to the base acres planted to crops 
    referred to in such paragraph in excess of 15 percent of base 
    acres.
        (3) Individual coverage.--In the case of agricultural risk 
    coverage payments using individual coverage, the reduction under 
    paragraph (1) shall be the amount equal to the base acres planted 
    to crops referred to in such paragraph in excess of 35 percent of 
    base acres.
        (4) Reduction exceptions.--No reduction to payment acres shall 
    be made under this subsection if--
            (A) cover crops or crops referred to in paragraph (1) are 
        grown solely for conservation purposes and not harvested for 
        use or sale, as determined by the Secretary; or
            (B) in any region in which there is a history of double-
        cropping covered commodities with crops referred to in 
        paragraph (1) and such crops were so double-cropped on the base 
        acres, as determined by the Secretary.
SEC. 1115. PRODUCER ELECTION.
    (a) Election Required.--For the 2014 through 2018 crop years, all 
of the producers on a farm shall make a 1-time, irrevocable election to 
obtain--
        (1) price loss coverage under section 1116 on a covered 
    commodity-by-covered-commodity basis; or
        (2) agriculture risk coverage under section 1117.
    (b) Coverage Options.--In the election under subsection (a), the 
producers on a farm that elect under paragraph (2) of such subsection 
to obtain agriculture risk coverage under section 1117 shall 
unanimously select whether to receive agriculture risk coverage 
payments based on--
        (1) county coverage applicable on a covered commodity-by-
    covered-commodity basis; or
        (2) individual coverage applicable to all of the covered 
    commodities on the farm.
    (c) Effect of Failure to Make Unanimous Election.--If all the 
producers on a farm fail to make a unanimous election under subsection 
(a) for the 2014 crop year--
        (1) the Secretary shall not make any payments with respect to 
    the farm for the 2014 crop year under section 1116 or 1117; and
        (2) the producers on the farm shall be deemed to have elected 
    price loss coverage under section 1116 for all covered commodities 
    on the farm for the 2015 through 2018 crop years.
    (d) Effect of Selection of County Coverage.--If all the producers 
on a farm select county coverage for a covered commodity under 
subsection (b)(1), the Secretary may not make price loss coverage 
payments under section 1116 to the producers on the farm with respect 
to that covered commodity.
    (e) Effect of Selection of Individual Coverage.--If all the 
producers on a farm select individual coverage under subsection (b)(2), 
in addition to the selection and election under this section applying 
to each producer on the farm, the Secretary shall consider, for 
purposes of making the calculations required by subsections (b)(2) and 
(c)(3) of section 1117, the producer's share of all farms in the same 
State--
        (1) in which the producer has an interest; and
        (2) for which individual coverage has been selected.
    (f) Prohibition on Reconstitution.--The Secretary shall ensure that 
producers on a farm do not reconstitute the farm to void or change an 
election or selection made under this section.
SEC. 1116. PRICE LOSS COVERAGE.
    (a) Price Loss Coverage Payments.--If all of the producers on a 
farm make the election under subsection (a) of section 1115 to obtain 
price loss coverage or, subject to subsection (c)(1) of such section, 
are deemed to have made such election under subsection (c)(2) of such 
section, the Secretary shall make price loss coverage payments to 
producers on the farm on a covered commodity-by-covered-commodity basis 
if the Secretary determines that, for any of the 2014 through 2018 crop 
years--
        (1) the effective price for the covered commodity for the crop 
    year; is less than
        (2) the reference price for the covered commodity for the crop 
    year.
    (b) Effective Price.--The effective price for a covered commodity 
for a crop year shall be the higher of--
        (1) the national average market price received by producers 
    during the 12-month marketing year for the covered commodity, as 
    determined by the Secretary; or
        (2) the national average loan rate for a marketing assistance 
    loan for the covered commodity in effect for such crop year under 
    subtitle B.
    (c) Payment Rate.--The payment rate shall be equal to the 
difference between--
        (1) the reference price for the covered commodity; and
        (2) the effective price determined under subsection (b) for the 
    covered commodity.
    (d) Payment Amount.--If price loss coverage payments are required 
to be provided under this section for any of the 2014 through 2018 crop 
years for a covered commodity, the amount of the price loss coverage 
payment to be paid to the producers on a farm for the crop year shall 
be equal to the product obtained by multiplying--
        (1) the payment rate for the covered commodity under subsection 
    (c);
        (2) the payment yield for the covered commodity; and
        (3) the payment acres for the covered commodity.
    (e) Time for Payments.--If the Secretary determines under this 
section that price loss coverage payments are required to be provided 
for the covered commodity, the payments shall be made beginning October 
1, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the 
applicable marketing year for the covered commodity.
    (f) Effective Price for Barley.--In determining the effective price 
for barley under subsection (b), the Secretary shall use the all-barley 
price.
    (g) Reference Price for Temperate Japonica Rice.--The Secretary 
shall provide a reference price with respect to temperate japonica rice 
in an amount equal to 115 percent of the amount established in 
subparagraphs (F) and (G) of section 1111(18) in order to reflect price 
premiums.
SEC. 1117. AGRICULTURE RISK COVERAGE.
    (a) Agriculture Risk Coverage Payments.--If all of the producers on 
a farm make the election under section 1115(a) to obtain agriculture 
risk coverage, the Secretary shall make agriculture risk coverage 
payments to producers on the farm if the Secretary determines that, for 
any of the 2014 through 2018 crop years--
        (1) the actual crop revenue determined under subsection (b) for 
    the crop year; is less than
        (2) the agriculture risk coverage guarantee determined under 
    subsection (c) for the crop year.
    (b) Actual Crop Revenue.--
        (1) County coverage.--In the case of county coverage, the 
    amount of the actual crop revenue for a county for a crop year of a 
    covered commodity shall be equal to the product obtained by 
    multiplying--
            (A) the actual average county yield per planted acre for 
        the covered commodity, as determined by the Secretary; and
            (B) the higher of--
                (i) the national average market price received by 
            producers during the 12-month marketing year for the 
            covered commodity, as determined by the Secretary; or
                (ii) the national average loan rate for a marketing 
            assistance loan for the covered commodity in effect for 
            such crop year under subtitle B.
        (2) Individual coverage.--In the case of individual coverage, 
    the amount of the actual crop revenue for a producer on a farm for 
    a crop year shall be based on the producer's share of all covered 
    commodities planted on all farms for which individual coverage has 
    been selected and in which the producer has an interest, to be 
    determined by the Secretary as follows:
            (A) For each covered commodity, the product obtained by 
        multiplying--
                (i) the total production of the covered commodity on 
            such farms, as determined by the Secretary; and
                (ii) the higher of--

                    (I) the national average market price received by 
                producers during the 12-month marketing year, as 
                determined by the Secretary; or
                    (II) the national average loan rate for a marketing 
                assistance loan for the covered commodity in effect for 
                such crop year under subtitle B.

            (B) The sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph 
        (A) for all covered commodities on such farms.
            (C) The quotient obtained by dividing the amount determined

        covered commodities on such farms.
    (c) Agriculture Risk Coverage Guarantee.--
        (1) In general.--The agriculture risk coverage guarantee for a 
    crop year for a covered commodity shall equal 86 percent of the 
    benchmark revenue.
        (2) Benchmark revenue for county coverage.--In the case of 
    county coverage, the benchmark revenue shall be the product 
    obtained by multiplying--
            (A) subject to paragraph (4), the average historical county 
        yield as determined by the Secretary for the most recent 5 crop 
        years, excluding each of the crop years with the highest and 
        lowest yields; and
            (B) subject to paragraph (5), the national average market 
        price received by producers during the 12-month marketing year 
        for the most recent 5 crop years, excluding each of the crop 
        years with the highest and lowest prices.
        (3) Benchmark revenue for individual coverage.--In the case of 
    individual coverage, the benchmark revenue for a producer on a farm 
    for a crop year shall be based on the producer's share of all 
    covered commodities planted on all farms for which individual 
    coverage has been selected and in which the producer has an 
    interest, to be determined by the Secretary as follows:
            (A) For each covered commodity for each of the most recent 
        5 crop years, the product obtained by multiplying--
                (i) subject to paragraph (4), the yield per planted 
            acre for the covered commodity on such farms, as determined 
            by the Secretary; by
                (ii) subject to paragraph (5), the national average 
            market price received by producers during the 12-month 
            marketing year.
            (B) For each covered commodity, the average of the revenues 
        determined under subparagraph (A) for the most recent 5 crop 
        years, excluding each of the crop years with the highest and 
        lowest revenues.
            (C) For each of the 2014 through 2018 crop years, the sum 
        of the amounts determined under subparagraph (B) for all 
        covered commodities on such farms, but adjusted to reflect the 
        ratio between the total number of acres planted on such farms 
        to a covered commodity and the total acres of all covered 
        commodities planted on such farms.
        (4) Yield conditions.--If the yield per planted acre for the 
    covered commodity or historical county yield per planted acre for 
    the covered commodity for any of the 5 most recent crop years, as 
    determined by the Secretary, is less than 70 percent of the 
    transitional yield, as determined by the Secretary, the amounts 
    used for any of those years in paragraph (2)(A) or (3)(A)(i) shall 
    be 70 percent of the transitional yield.
        (5) Reference price.--If the national average market price 
    received by producers during the 12-month marketing year for any of 
    the 5 most recent crop years is lower than the reference price for 
    the covered commodity, the Secretary shall use the reference price 
    for any of those years for the amounts in paragraph (2)(B) or 
    (3)(A)(ii).
    (d) Payment Rate.--The payment rate for a covered commodity, in the 
case of county coverage, or a farm, in the case of individual coverage, 
shall be equal to the lesser of--
        (1) the amount that--
            (A) the agriculture risk coverage guarantee for the crop 
        year applicable under subsection (c); exceeds
            (B) the actual crop revenue for the crop year applicable 
        under subsection (b); or
        (2) 10 percent of the benchmark revenue for the crop year 
    applicable under subsection (c).
    (e) Payment Amount.--If agriculture risk coverage payments are 
required to be paid for any of the 2014 through 2018 crop years, the 
amount of the agriculture risk coverage payment for the crop year shall 
be determined by multiplying--
        (1) the payment rate determined under subsection (d); and
        (2) the payment acres determined under section 1114.
    (f) Time for Payments.--If the Secretary determines that 
agriculture risk coverage payments are required to be provided for the 
covered commodity, payments shall be made beginning October 1, or as 
soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the applicable 
marketing year for the covered commodity.
    (g) Additional Duties of the Secretary.--In providing agriculture 
risk coverage, the Secretary shall--
        (1) to the maximum extent practicable, use all available 
    information and analysis, including data mining, to check for 
    anomalies in the determination of agriculture risk coverage 
    payments;
        (2) to the maximum extent practicable, calculate a separate 
    actual crop revenue and agriculture risk coverage guarantee for 
    irrigated and nonirrigated covered commodities;
        (3) in the case of individual coverage, assign an average yield 
    for a farm on the basis of the yield history of representative 
    farms in the State, region, or crop reporting district, as 
    determined by the Secretary, if the Secretary determines that the 
    farm has planted acreage in a quantity that is insufficient to 
    calculate a representative average yield for the farm; and
        (4) in the case of county coverage, assign an actual or 
    benchmark county yield for each planted acre for the crop year for 
    the covered commodity on the basis of the yield history of 
    representative farms in the State, region, or crop reporting 
    district, as determined by the Secretary, if--
            (A) the Secretary cannot establish the actual or benchmark 
        county yield for each planted acre for a crop year for a 
        covered commodity in the county in accordance with subsection 
        (b)(1) or (c)(2); or
            (B) the yield determined under subsection (b)(1) or (c)(2) 
        is an unrepresentative average yield for the county, as 
        determined by the Secretary.
