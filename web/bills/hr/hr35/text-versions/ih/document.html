_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
                To restore safety to America's schools.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Schools Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds--
            (1) that the Supreme Court has found language nearly 
        identical to the ``Gun Free School Zones Act'' to be 
        unconstitutional;
            (2) that the enactment of the ``Gun Free School Zones Act'' 
        has been met with an almost uninterrupted series of horrific 
        and tragic shootings at Columbine, Newtown and in other 
        American schools;
            (3) that the ``Gun Free School Zones Act'' has been a 
        deadly failure. According to research by GeorgiaCarry.org, in 
        the 22 years prior to enactment of the ``Gun Free School Zones 
        Act'' there were two school shootings in which four or more 
        people were intentionally murdered in a short period of time, 
        and in the 22 years after the enactment of the ``Gun Free 
        School Zones Act'' there have been 10 such school shootings;
            (4) that American schools had not been plagued with this 
        succession of horrific shootings prior to the enactment of the 
        ``Gun Free School Zones Act'';
            (5) that horrific massacres on school campuses in Pearl, 
        Mississippi, and southwestern Virginia, were averted by armed 
        staff and students;
            (6) that none of the murderers in any of these horrific 
        school shootings were deterred by the fact that, in addition to 
        murder, gun possession was also illegal in those locations; and
            (7) that the reason that the ``Gun Free School Zones Act'' 
        has made American schools unsafe is that shooters now know that 
        they can victimize American school campuses with no fear that 
        victims will be armed.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to restore safety to 
America's schools by allowing staff, teachers, and administrators to 
defend the children and themselves.

SEC. 3. SAFE SCHOOLS.

    Subsection (q) of section 922 of Title 18, United States Code, is 
repealed.
