    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Day Off Act''.

        employee who--
                    (A) is a veteran, as that term is defined in 
                section 101 of title 38, United States Code; and
                    (B) has been employed for at least 12 months by the 
                employer with respect to whom leave is requested under 
                section 3.
            (2) Exclusions.--The term ``eligible employee'' does not 
        include an individual employed by a public agency, as that term 
        is defined in section 3(e)(2) of the Fair Labor Standards Act 
        of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(3)(e)(2)).

and (g)).
    (c) Employer.--The term ``employer'' means any person engaged in

50 or more employees during a calendar year, and includes any person 
who acts, directly or indirectly, in the interest of any employer to 
any of the employees of such employer and any successor in interest of

terms in section 101(1) of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
    (d) Person.--The term ``person'' has the same meaning given such

            (2) Exceptions.--An employer may deny leave to an eligible

        subsection (a)--
                    (A) whether the employee shall be provided leave; 
                and
                    (B) if so, whether the leave shall be paid or 
                unpaid.
            (2) Denial of leave request.--If an employer receives 
        multiple requests for leave under subsection (a)(1) and denies
