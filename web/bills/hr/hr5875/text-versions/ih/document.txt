which section 408B applies, there is hereby imposed on the employer for 
the taxable year a tax equal to 10 percent of the aggregate required 
contributions to such automatic deferral IRA for all plan years that 
are not paid by the date specified in section 408B(c)(4)(A)(i) and that

    (b) Simplification.--
            (1) Model plan.--Within one year of the date of the

        publish a model plan that may be used to satisfy the 
        requirement of subclause (V) of section 401(k)(11)(E)(ii) of 
        the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
            (2) Protection against loss.--Within 120 days of the date 
        of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall 
        amend Department of Labor Regulation section 2550.404c-
        5(e)(4)(iv)(B) so that, in the case of a plan described in 
        section 401(k)(11)(E) of such Code ``four years'' shall be 
        substituted for ``120 days''.
            (3) Clarifying duties and reducing burdens for multiple 
        employer plans.--Within one year of the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall--
                    (A) publish rules clarifying the extent to which 
                the fiduciary duties, if any, of a participating 
                employer fiduciary with respect to a plan described in 
                section 413(c) of such Code are limited to--
                            (i) the selection and monitoring of the 
                        named fiduciary, and
                            (ii) the investment and management of the 
                        portion of the plan's assets attributable to 
                        employees of the employer to the extent not 
                        otherwise delegated to another fiduciary, and
                    (B) prescribe interim final regulations providing 
                simplified means by which plans described in section 
                413(c) of such Code may satisfy the requirements of 
                sections 102, 103, and 105 of the Employee Retirement 
                Income Security Act of 1974.
        For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``participating 
        employer fiduciary'' means the participating employer, any 
        employee of such participating employer that serves as 
        fiduciary, any committee of such employees, and any other 
        person whose fiduciaries duties with respect to the plan relate 
        solely to the participating employer and not to the operation 
        of the plan with respect to all participating employers.
            (4) Elimination of disincentive to pooling.--Not later than 
        one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
        Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe final regulations 
        under which a plan described in section 413(c) of such Code may 
        be treated as satisfying the qualification requirements of 
        section 401(a) of such Code despite the violation of such 
        requirements with respect to one or more participating 
        employers without regard to whether such violation continues. 
        Solely for this purpose, a plan shall be treated as violating 
        the qualification requirements of section 401(a) of such Code 
        with respect to a participating employer if such employer has 
        failed to provide the plan sponsor with the information needed 
        to comply with such requirements and such failure has continued 
        over a period of time that clearly demonstrates a lack of 
        commitment to compliance. Such rules may require that the 
        portion of the plan attributable to such participating 
        employers be spun off to plans maintained by such employers.
    (c) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        amendments made by this section shall apply to years beginning 
        after December 31, 2015.
            (2) Exception.--Subsection (b) shall apply as of the date 
        of the enactment of this Act.

        plan.
            ``(v) The requirements of this clause are met if each 
        employer maintaining the plan is an eligible employer as 
        defined in section 408(p)(2)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code

            (2) Simplified reporting for small multiple employer 
        plans.--Section 104(a) of such Act (29 U.S.C. 1024(a)) is 
        amended by adding at the end the following:

SEC. 20. LIFETIME INCOME SAFE HARBOR.

    Section 404 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(29 U.S.C. 1104) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e) Safe Harbor for Annuity Selection.--
            ``(1) In general.--With respect to the selection of an 
        insurer and a guaranteed retirement income contract, the 
        requirements of subsection (a)(1)(B) will be deemed to be 
        satisfied if a fiduciary--

                preclude the insurer from making the same 
                representations at the time of issuance of the 
                guaranteed retirement income contract, the insurer 
                shall notify the fiduciary, in advance of the issuance 
                of any guaranteed retirement income contract, that the 
                fiduciary can no longer rely on one or more of the 
                representations; and

                notification described in subparagraph (B) and has no

                representations described in clauses (i) through (iii) 
                of subparagraph (A).
            ``(3) The final regulation described in (a) shall clarify 
        that the standard of care is not construed to require a 
        fiduciary to select the lowest cost contract. Accordingly, a 
        fiduciary may consider the value, including features and 
        benefits of the contract and attributes of the insurer in 
        conjunction with the contract's cost. Attributes of the insurer 
        that may be considered may include, without limitation, the 
        issuer's financial strength.

                    ``(A) For purposes of paragraph (1), the `time of 
                selection' may be either--

                        contract are selected for distribution of

                        beneficiary; or

                        appropriateness of the conclusion described in 
                        paragraph (1)(C), taking into account the 
                        considerations described in paragraph (1).
                For purposes of this paragraph, a fiduciary is not 
                required to review the appropriateness of this 
                conclusion following the purchase of any contract(s) 
                for specific participants or beneficiaries.

                fiduciary will be deemed to have conducted a periodic 
                review of the financial capability of the insurer if 
                the fiduciary obtains the written representations 
                described in clauses (i) through (iii) of paragraph 
                (2)(A) on an annual basis, unless, in the interim, the 
                fiduciary has received the notice described in 
                paragraph (2)(B) or otherwise becomes aware of facts 
                that would cause it to question the such 
                representations.

        satisfy the requirements of this section shall not be liable

        or on behalf of a participant or beneficiary pursuant to the 
        selected guaranteed retirement income contract for any losses 
        that may result to the participant or beneficiary due to an 
        insurer's inability to satisfy its financial obligations under 
        the terms of such contract.
