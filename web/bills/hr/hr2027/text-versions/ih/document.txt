                inpatient prospective payment system and outpatient 
                prospective payment system operating margin for the 
                most recent 3 consecutive cost reporting periods for 
                which data are available. Once the Secretary makes a 
                determination that a hospital has such a negative 
                operating margin for a cost reporting period, the 
                Secretary may not reverse such determination for such 
                period. A hospital that is treated as being in 
                financial distress under this subparagraph for a cost 
                reporting period shall continue to be so treated for 
                all subsequent cost reporting periods as being in 
                financial distress without regard to changes in the 
                hospital's operating margin.''.
