        revenue loss coverage with respect to the acreage added to the 
        farm under this subsection or a prorated payment under the 
        conservation reserve contract, but not both.
    (b) Prevention of Excess Base Acres.--
            (1) Required reduction.--If the sum of the base acres for a 
        farm, together with the acreage described in paragraph (2) 
        exceeds the actual cropland acreage of the farm, the Secretary 
        shall reduce the base acres for 1 or more covered commodities 
        or cotton for the farm so that the sum of the base acres and 
        acreage described in paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual

                    (B) Any other acreage on the farm enrolled in a 
                Federal conservation program for which payments are 
                made in exchange for not producing an agricultural 
                commodity on the acreage.
                    (C) If the Secretary designates additional 
                oilseeds, any eligible oilseed acreage, which shall be

                acreage under subsection (a)(1)(C).
            (3) Selection of acres.--The Secretary shall give the owner 
        of the farm the opportunity to select the base acres for a 
        covered commodity or cotton for the farm against which the 
        reduction required by paragraph (1) will be made.
            (4) Exception for double-cropped acreage.--In applying 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make an exception in the

                subdivided and developed for multiple residential units 
                or other nonfarming uses if the size of the tracts and 
                the density of the subdivision is such that the land is 
                unlikely to return to the previous agricultural use, 
                unless the producers on the farm demonstrate that the 
                land--
                            (i) remains devoted to commercial 
                        agricultural production; or
                            (ii) is likely to be returned to the

                    (B) Requirement.--The Secretary shall establish 
                procedures to identify land described in subparagraph

SEC. 1106. PAYMENT YIELDS.

    (a) Establishment and Purpose.--For the purpose of making payments 
under this subtitle, the Secretary shall provide for the establishment 
of a yield for each farm for any designated oilseed for which a payment 
yield was not established under section 1102 of the Food, Conservation, 
and Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8712) in accordance with this section.
    (b) Payment Yields for Designated Oilseeds.--
            (1) Determination of average yield.--In the case of 
        designated oilseeds, the Secretary shall determine the average 
        yield per planted acre for the designated oilseed on a farm for 
        the 1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in 
        which the acreage planted to the designated oilseed was zero.
            (2) Adjustment for payment yield.--
                    (A) In general.--The payment yield for a farm for a 
                designated oilseed shall be equal to the product of the 
                following:
                            (i) The average yield for the designated 
                        oilseed determined under paragraph (1).
                            (ii) The ratio resulting from dividing the 
                        national average yield for the designated 
                        oilseed for the 1981 through 1985 crops by the 
                        national average yield for the designated 
                        oilseed for the 1998 through 2001 crops.
                    (B) No national average yield information 
                available.--To the extent that national average yield 
                information for a designated oilseed is not available, 
                the Secretary shall use such information as the 
                Secretary determines to be fair and equitable to 
                establish a national average yield under this section.
            (3) Use of county average yield.--If the yield per planted 
        acre for a crop of a designated oilseed for a farm for any of 
        the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent of 
        the county yield for that designated oilseed, the Secretary 
        shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of 
        the county yield for the purpose of determining the average 
        under paragraph (1).
            (4) No historic yield data available.--In the case of 
        establishing yields for designated oilseeds, if historic yield 
        data is not available, the Secretary shall use the ratio for 
        dry peas calculated under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) in determining 
        the yields for designated oilseeds, as determined to be fair 
        and equitable by the Secretary.
    (c) Effect of Lack of Payment Yield.--
            (1) Establishment by secretary.--If no payment yield is 
        otherwise established for a farm for which a covered commodity 
        is planted and eligible to receive price loss coverage 
        payments, the Secretary shall establish an appropriate payment 
        yield for the covered commodity on the farm under paragraph 
        (2).
            (2) Use of similarly situated farms.--To establish an 
        appropriate payment yield for a covered commodity on a farm as 
        required by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take into 
        consideration the farm program payment yields applicable to 
        that covered commodity for similarly situated farms. The use of 
        such data in an appeal, by the Secretary or by the producer, 
        shall not be subject to any other provision of law.
    (d) Single Opportunity to Update Yields Used to Determine Price 
Loss Coverage Payments.--
            (1) Election to update.--At the sole discretion of the 
        owner of a farm, the owner of a farm shall have a 1-time 
        opportunity to update the payment yields on a covered 
        commodity-by-covered commodity basis that would otherwise be 
        used in calculating any price loss coverage payment for covered 
        commodities on the farm.
            (2) Time for election.--The election under paragraph (1) 
        shall be made at a time and manner to be in effect for the 2014 
        crop year as determined by the Secretary.
            (3) Method of updating yields.--If the owner of a farm 
        elects to update yields under this subsection, the payment 
        yield for a covered commodity on the farm, for the purpose of 
        calculating price loss coverage payments only, shall be equal 
        to 90 percent of the average of the yield per planted acre for 
        the crop of the covered commodity on the farm for the 2008 
        through 2012 crop years, as determined by the Secretary, 
        excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the 
        crop of the covered commodity was zero.
            (4) Use of county average yield.--If the yield per planted 
        acre for a crop of the covered commodity for a farm for any of 
        the 2008 through 2012 crop years was less than 75 percent of 
        the average of the 2008 through 2012 county yield for that 
        commodity, the Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop 
        year equal to 75 percent of the average of the 2008 through 
        2012 county yield for the purposes of determining the average 
        yield under paragraph (3).
            (5) Effect of lack of payment yield.--
                    (A) Establishment by secretary.--For purposes of 
                this subsection, if no payment yield is otherwise 
                established for a covered commodity on a farm, the 
                Secretary shall establish an appropriate updated 
                payment yield for the covered commodity on the farm 
                under subparagraph (B).
                    (B) Use of similarly situated farms.--To establish 
                an appropriate payment yield for a covered commodity on 
                a farm as required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary 
                shall take into consideration the farm program payment 
                yields applicable to that covered commodity for 
                similarly situated farms. The use of such data in an 
                appeal, by the Secretary or by the producer, shall not 
                be subject to any other provision of law.

            (4) Payment amount.--If price loss coverage payments are 
        required to be provided under this subsection for any of the 
        2014 through 2018 crop years for a covered commodity, the

        product obtained by multiplying--
                    (A) the payment rate for the covered commodity

        covered commodity basis to receive revenue loss coverage 
        payments for each covered commodity in accordance with this

                the crop year for the covered commodity.
            (3) Time for payments.--If the Secretary determines under 
        this subsection that revenue loss coverage payments are 
        required to be provided for the covered commodity, payments 
        shall be made beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable 
        thereafter, after the end of the applicable marketing year for 
        the covered commodity.
            (4) Actual county revenue.--The amount of the actual county

                    (A) the actual county yield, as determined by the 
                Secretary, for each planted acre for the crop year for 
                the covered commodity; and
                    (B) the higher of--
                            (i) the midseason price; or

                        commodity in effect for crop years 2014 through

                trigger for a crop year for a covered commodity on a 
                farm shall equal 85 percent of the benchmark county 
                revenue.
                    (B) Benchmark county revenue.--
                            (i) In general.--The benchmark county

                                average historical county yield as

                                each of the crop years with the highest 
                                and lowest yields; and
                                    (II) subject to clause (iii), the

                                excluding each of the crop years with 
                                the highest and lowest prices.
                            (ii) Yield conditions.--If the historical 
                        county yield in clause (i)(I) for any of the 5 
                        most recent crop years, as determined by the 
                        Secretary, is less than 70 percent of the 
                        transitional yield, as determined by the 
                        Secretary, the amounts used for any of those 
                        years in clause (i)(I) shall be 70 percent of 
                        the transitional yield.

                        marketing year average price in clause (i)(II) 
                        for any of the 5 most recent crop years is 
                        lower than the reference price for the covered 
                        commodity, the Secretary shall use the 
                        reference price for any of those years for the 
                        amounts in clause (i)(II).
            (6) Payment rate.--The payment rate shall be equal to the

                    (B) the payment acres of the covered commodity on

                irrigated and nonirrigated covered commodities;
                    (D) shall assign a benchmark county yield for each 
                planted acre for the crop year for the covered

                representative farms in the State, region, or crop 
                reporting district, as determined by the Secretary,

                subsection.
            (4) Review of adjustments.--The Secretary may review the 
        operation of the upland cotton quality adjustments implemented 
        pursuant to this subsection and may make further adjustments to 
        the administration of the loan program for upland cotton, by 
        revoking or revising any adjustment taken under paragraph (2).
    (e) Rice.--The Secretary shall not make adjustments in the loan 
rates for long grain rice and medium grain rice, except for differences

            (4) Notice of intent and obligation to participate in 
        margin protection program.--In no way does filing a notice of 
        intent under this subsection obligate a dairy producer to sign 
        up for the margin protection program once the program rules are 
        final, but if a producer does file a notice of intent and 
        subsequently signs up for the margin protection program, that 
        dairy producer is obligated to pay fees and premiums for any 
        retroactive basic margin protection or retroactive supplemental

        program.
            (2) Fee amount.--The administrative fee for a participating 
        dairy producer for a calendar year is based on the pounds of 
        milk (in millions) marketed by the dairy producer in the 
        previous calendar year, as follows:


------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pounds Marketed (in millions)                  Admin. Fee
------------------------------------------------------------------------

        fees collected under this subsection--
                    (A) to cover administrative costs of the margin 
                protection program and stabilization program; and
                    (B) to the extent funds remain available after 
                operation of subparagraphs (A), to cover costs of the 
                Department of Agriculture relating to reporting of 
                dairy market news and to carry out section 273 of the 
                Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1637b).
    (f) Reconstitution.--The Secretary shall prohibit a dairy producer 
from reconstituting a dairy operation for the sole purpose of the dairy 
producer--
            (1) receiving basic margin protection;
            (2) purchasing supplemental margin protection; or
            (3) avoiding participation in the stabilization program.
    (g) Priority Consideration.--A dairy operation that participates in 
the margin protection program shall be eligible to participate in the 
livestock gross margin for dairy program under the Federal Crop 
Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) only after operations that are 
not participating in the production margin protection program are 
enrolled.

SEC. 1413. PRODUCTION HISTORY OF PARTICIPATING DAIRY PRODUCERS.

    (a) Production History for Basic Margin Protection.--
            (1) Determination required.--For purposes of providing 
        basic margin protection, the Secretary shall determine the 
        basic production history of the dairy operation of each 
        participating dairy producer in the margin protection program.
            (2) Calculation.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), the 
        basic production history of a participating dairy producer for 
        basic margin protection is equal to the highest annual milk 
        marketings of the dairy producer during any one of the three 
        calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which 
        the dairy producer first signed up to participate in the margin 
        protection program.
            (3) Election by new producers.--If a participating dairy 
        producer has been in operation for less than a year, the dairy 
        producer shall elect one of the following methods for the 
        Secretary to determine the basic production history of the 
        dairy producer:
                    (A) The volume of the actual milk marketings for 
                the months the dairy producer has been in operation 
                extrapolated to a yearly amount.
                    (B) An estimate of the actual milk marketings of 
                the dairy producer based on the herd size of the 
                producer relative to the national rolling herd average 
                data published by the Secretary.
            (4) No change in production history for basic margin 
        protection.--Once the basic production history of a 
        participating dairy producer is determined under paragraph (2) 
        or (3), the basic production history shall not be subsequently 
        changed for purposes of determining the amount of any basic 
        margin protection payments for the dairy producer made under 
        section 1414.
    (b) Annual Production History for Supplemental Margin Protection.--
            (1) Determination required.--For purposes of providing 
        supplemental margin protection for a participating dairy 
        producer that purchases supplemental margin protection for a 
        year under section 1415, the Secretary shall determine the 
        annual production history of the dairy operation of the dairy 
        producer under paragraph (2).
            (2) Calculation.--The annual production history of a 
        participating dairy producer for a year is equal to the actual 
        milk marketings of the dairy producer during the preceding 
        calendar year.
            (3) New producers.--Subsection (a)(3) shall apply with 
        respect to determining the annual production history of a 
        participating dairy producer that has been in operation for 
        less than a year.
    (c) Required Information.--A participating dairy producer shall 
provide all information that the Secretary may require in order to 
establish--
            (1) the basic production history of the dairy operation of 
        the dairy producer under subsection (a); and
            (2) the production history of the dairy operation of the 
        dairy producer whenever the producer purchases supplemental 
        margin protection under section 1415.
    (d) Transfer of Production Histories.--
            (1) Transfer by sale or lease.--In promulgating the rules

                protection coverage than the supplemental margin 
                protection coverage in effect for the seller or lessor 
                from whom the transfer was obtained for the calendar 
                year in which the transfer was made.

            (4) Time for payment.--In promulgating the rules to 
        initiate the margin protection program, the Secretary shall 
        provide more than one method by which a participating dairy 
        producer that purchases supplemental margin protection for a 
        calendar year may pay the premium under this subsection for 
        that year that maximizes producer payment flexibility and 
        program integrity.
    (e) Producer's Premium Obligations.--
            (1) Pro-ration of premium for new producers.--A dairy 
        producer described in section 1412(c)(2) that purchases 
        supplemental margin protection for a calendar year after the 
        start of the calendar year shall pay a pro-rated premium for 
        that calendar year based on the portion of the calendar year 
        for which the producer purchases the coverage.
            (2) Legal obligation.--A participating dairy producer that 
        purchases supplemental margin protection for a calendar year 
        shall be legally obligated to pay the applicable premium for 
        that calendar year, except that, if the dairy producer retires, 
        the producer may request that Secretary cancel the supplemental 
        margin protection if the producer has terminated the dairy 
        operation entirely and certifies under oath that the producer 
        will not be actively engaged in any dairy operation for at 
        least the next seven years.
    (f) Supplemental Payment Threshold.--A participating dairy producer 
with supplemental margin protection shall receive a supplemental margin 
protection payment whenever the average actual dairy producer margin 
for a consecutive two-month period is less than the coverage level 
threshold selected by the dairy producer under subsection (b).
    (g) Supplemental Margin Protection Payments.--
            (1) In general.--The supplemental margin protection payment 
        for a participating dairy producer is in addition to the basic 
        margin protection payment.
            (2) Amount of payment.--The supplemental margin protection 
        payment for the dairy operation of a participating dairy 
        producer shall be determined as follows:
                    (A) The Secretary shall calculate the difference 
                between the coverage level threshold selected by the 
                dairy producer under subsection (b) and the greater 
                of--
                            (i) the average actual dairy producer 
                        margin for the consecutive two-month period; or
                            (ii) $4.00.
                    (B) The amount determined under subparagraph (A) 
                shall be multiplied by the percentage selected by the 
                participating dairy producer under subsection (c) and 
                by the lesser of the following:
                            (i) The annual production history of the 
                        dairy operation of the dairy producer, divided 
                        by six.
                            (ii) The actual amount of milk marketed by 
                        the dairy operation of the dairy producer 
                        during the consecutive two-month period.

        or premiums, as the case may be; and
            (2) may not receive basic margin protection payments or 
        supplemental margin protection payments until the fees or 
        premiums are fully paid.

SEC. 12314. PROHIBITION AGAINST INTERFERENCE BY STATE AND LOCAL 
              GOVERNMENTS WITH PRODUCTION OR MANUFACTURE OF ITEMS IN 
              OTHER STATES.

    (a) In General.--Consistent with Article I, section 8, clause 3 of 
the Constitution of the United States, the government of a State or 
locality therein shall not impose a standard or condition on the 
production or manufacture of any agricultural product sold or offered 
for sale in interstate commerce if--
            (1) such production or manufacture occurs in another State; 
        and
            (2) the standard or condition is in addition to the 
        standards and conditions applicable to such production or 
        manufacture pursuant to--
                    (A) Federal law; and
                    (B) the laws of the State and locality in which 
                such production or manufacture occurs.
    (b) Agricultural Product Defined.--In this section, the term 
``agricultural product'' has the meaning given such term in section 207 
of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1626).

SEC. 12315. INCREASED PROTECTION FOR AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS IN THE 
              MISSOURI RIVER BASIN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Record runoff occurred in the Missouri River basin 
        during 2011 as a result of historic rainfall over portions of 
        the upper basin coupled with heavy plains and mountain 
        snowpack.
            (2) Runoff above Sioux City, Iowa, during the 5-month 
        period of March through July totaled an estimated 48.4 million 
        acre-feet (referred to in this section as ``MAF''). This runoff 
        volume was more than 20 percent greater than the design storm 
        for the Missouri River Mainstem Reservoir System (referred to 
        in this section as the ``System''), which was based on the 1881 
        runoff of 40.0 MAF during the same 5-month period.
            (3) During the 2011 runoff season, nearly 61 million acre-
        feet of water entered the Missouri River system, far surpassing 
        the previous record of 49 MAF in runoff that was set during the 
        flood of 1997.
            (4) Given the incredible amount of water entering the 
        System, the summer months were spent working to evacuate as 
        much water from the System as possible, ultimately leading to 
        record high water releases from Gavins Point Dam of 160,000 
        cubic feet per second, a rate that more than doubled the 
        previous release record of 70,000 cubic feet per second set in 
        1997.
            (5) For nearly four months, those extremely high releases 
        from Gavins Point were maintained, resulting in severe and 
        sustained flooding, with much of western Iowa and eastern 
        Nebraska as well as portions of South Dakota, Kansas, and 
        Missouri inundated by a flooding river three to five feet deep, 
        up to 11 miles wide, and flowing at a rate of 4 to 11 miles per 
        hour.
            (6) Thousands of homes and businesses were damaged or 
        destroyed and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage was 
        done to roads and other public infrastructure.
            (7) In addition to the homes, businesses, and 
        infrastructure impacted by the flooding, hundreds of thousands 
        of acres of cropland were affected.
            (8) The Department of Agriculture has estimated that 
        400,000 to 500,000 acres of some of the most productive crop 
        land in the world was flooded in 2011.
            (9) Local Farm Services Agency representatives have 
        estimated that $82,100,000 was lost in 2011 alone due to 
        damaged or lost crops and unplanted acres.
            (10) Not only did the flooding eliminate the 2011 crop, but 
        it is highly unlikely that many farmers will be able to put 
        that land back into production at any point in the near future.
            (11) Producers will have to contend with large piles of 
        sand, silt, and other debris that have been deposited in their 
        fields, meaning the impact of the 2011 flood will be felt in 
        the agricultural communities up and down the Missouri River for 
        many years to come.
            (12) Currently, the amount of storage capacity in the 
        System that is set aside for flood control is based upon the 
        vacated space required to control the 1881 flood, because prior 
        to the 2011 flood, the 1881 flood was seen as the ``high water 
        mark''.
            (13) Given the historic flooding that took place in 2011, 
        it is clear that that year's flooding now represents a new 
        ``high water mark'', surpassing the flooding of even the 1881 
        flood.
            (14) It is important that the flood control related 
        functions of the System management be adjusted to reflect the 
        reality of the 2011 flood as the new ``worst case scenario'' 
        for flooding along the Missouri River.
            (15) System management may begin to be adjusted to account 
        for the 2011 flood through a recalculation of the amount of 
        storage space within the System that is allocated to flood 
        control, using the model not of the 1881 flood, but of the 
        greatest flood experienced--the flood of 2011.
            (16) As a result of the flooding in 2011, many States 
        received disaster declarations from the Department of 
        Agriculture to help farmers and producers recover from the 
        damage done by the high water.
            (17) Though helpful, even the assistance provided by the 
        Department of Agriculture will not provide many in the 
        agriculture community with the resources to put their land back 
        into production any time soon.
            (18) Without the protection that will come from a 
        fundamental change in the System's flood control storage 
        allocations, farmers, producers, and other agricultural 
        interests who may be in a position to restart their operations 
        will find it difficult to justify doing so, given the fact that 
        they will not be protected from similar flooding in the future.
    (b) Updated Management of the Missouri River To Protect 
Agricultural Interests.--In order to strengthen the agricultural 
economy, revitalize the rural communities, and conserve the natural 
resources of the Missouri River basin, the Congress directs that the 
Secretary of Agriculture take action to promote immediate increased 
flood protection to farmers, producers, and other agricultural 
interests in the Missouri River basin by working within its 
jurisdiction to support efforts--
            (1) to recalculate the amount of space within the System 
        that is allocated to flood control storage using the 2011 flood 
        as the model; and
            (2) to increase the Missouri River's channel capacity 
        between the reservoirs and below Gavins Point.

SEC. 12316. INCREASED PROTECTION FOR AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS IN THE 
              BLACK DIRT REGION.

    In order to strengthen the agricultural economy, revitalize the 
rural communities, and conserve the natural resources of the Black Dirt 
region, the Congress directs that the Secretary of Agriculture take 
action to promote immediate increased flood protection to farmers, 
producers, and other agricultural interests around the Wallkill River 
and in the Black Dirt region.

                commodity on the acreage.
                    (C) If the Secretary designates additional 
                oilseeds, any eligible oilseed acreage, which shall be

                subdivided and developed for multiple residential units 
                or other nonfarming uses if the size of the tracts and 
                the density of the subdivision is such that the land is 
                unlikely to return to the previous agricultural use, 
                unless the producers on the farm demonstrate that the 
                land--
                            (i) remains devoted to commercial 
                        agricultural production; or

SEC. 1106. PAYMENT YIELDS.

    (a) Establishment and Purpose.--For the purpose of making payments 
under this subtitle, the Secretary shall provide for the establishment 
of a yield for each farm for any designated oilseed for which a payment 
yield was not established under section 1102 of the Food, Conservation, 
and Energy Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 8712) in accordance with this section.
    (b) Payment Yields for Designated Oilseeds.--
            (1) Determination of average yield.--In the case of 
        designated oilseeds, the Secretary shall determine the average 
        yield per planted acre for the designated oilseed on a farm for 
        the 1998 through 2001 crop years, excluding any crop year in 
        which the acreage planted to the designated oilseed was zero.
            (2) Adjustment for payment yield.--
                    (A) In general.--The payment yield for a farm for a 
                designated oilseed shall be equal to the product of the 
                following:
                            (i) The average yield for the designated 
                        oilseed determined under paragraph (1).
                            (ii) The ratio resulting from dividing the 
                        national average yield for the designated 
                        oilseed for the 1981 through 1985 crops by the 
                        national average yield for the designated 
                        oilseed for the 1998 through 2001 crops.
                    (B) No national average yield information 
                available.--To the extent that national average yield 
                information for a designated oilseed is not available, 
                the Secretary shall use such information as the 
                Secretary determines to be fair and equitable to 
                establish a national average yield under this section.
            (3) Use of county average yield.--If the yield per planted 
        acre for a crop of a designated oilseed for a farm for any of 
        the 1998 through 2001 crop years was less than 75 percent of 
        the county yield for that designated oilseed, the Secretary 
        shall assign a yield for that crop year equal to 75 percent of 
        the county yield for the purpose of determining the average 
        under paragraph (1).
            (4) No historic yield data available.--In the case of 
        establishing yields for designated oilseeds, if historic yield 
        data is not available, the Secretary shall use the ratio for 
        dry peas calculated under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) in determining 
        the yields for designated oilseeds, as determined to be fair 
        and equitable by the Secretary.
    (c) Effect of Lack of Payment Yield.--
            (1) Establishment by secretary.--If no payment yield is 
        otherwise established for a farm for which a covered commodity 
        is planted and eligible to receive price loss coverage 
        payments, the Secretary shall establish an appropriate payment 
        yield for the covered commodity on the farm under paragraph 
        (2).
            (2) Use of similarly situated farms.--To establish an 
        appropriate payment yield for a covered commodity on a farm as 
        required by paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take into 
        consideration the farm program payment yields applicable to 
        that covered commodity for similarly situated farms. The use of 
        such data in an appeal, by the Secretary or by the producer, 
        shall not be subject to any other provision of law.
    (d) Single Opportunity to Update Yields Used to Determine Price 
Loss Coverage Payments.--
            (1) Election to update.--At the sole discretion of the 
        owner of a farm, the owner of a farm shall have a 1-time 
        opportunity to update the payment yields on a covered 
        commodity-by-covered commodity basis that would otherwise be 
        used in calculating any price loss coverage payment for covered 
        commodities on the farm.
            (2) Time for election.--The election under paragraph (1) 
        shall be made at a time and manner to be in effect for the 2014 
        crop year as determined by the Secretary.
            (3) Method of updating yields.--If the owner of a farm 
        elects to update yields under this subsection, the payment 
        yield for a covered commodity on the farm, for the purpose of 
        calculating price loss coverage payments only, shall be equal 
        to 90 percent of the average of the yield per planted acre for 
        the crop of the covered commodity on the farm for the 2008 
        through 2012 crop years, as determined by the Secretary, 
        excluding any crop year in which the acreage planted to the 
        crop of the covered commodity was zero.
            (4) Use of county average yield.--If the yield per planted 
        acre for a crop of the covered commodity for a farm for any of 
        the 2008 through 2012 crop years was less than 75 percent of 
        the average of the 2008 through 2012 county yield for that 
        commodity, the Secretary shall assign a yield for that crop 
        year equal to 75 percent of the average of the 2008 through 
        2012 county yield for the purposes of determining the average 
        yield under paragraph (3).
            (5) Effect of lack of payment yield.--
                    (A) Establishment by secretary.--For purposes of 
                this subsection, if no payment yield is otherwise 
                established for a covered commodity on a farm, the 
                Secretary shall establish an appropriate updated 
                payment yield for the covered commodity on the farm 
                under subparagraph (B).
                    (B) Use of similarly situated farms.--To establish 
                an appropriate payment yield for a covered commodity on 
                a farm as required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary 
                shall take into consideration the farm program payment 
                yields applicable to that covered commodity for 
                similarly situated farms. The use of such data in an 
                appeal, by the Secretary or by the producer, shall not 
                be subject to any other provision of law.

                    (A) the effective price for the covered commodity 
                for the crop year; is less than
                    (B) the reference price for the covered commodity 
                for the crop year.
            (2) Effective price.--The effective price for a covered 
        commodity for a crop year shall be the higher of--
                    (A) the midseason price; or
                    (B) the national average loan rate for a marketing

                crop years 2014 through 2018 under subtitle B.
            (3) Payment rate.--The payment rate shall be equal to the 
        difference between--
                    (A) the reference price for the covered commodity;

        producers on a farm for the crop year shall be equal to the 
        product obtained by multiplying--
                    (A) the payment rate for the covered commodity 
                under paragraph (3);

        one-time, irrevocable election on a covered commodity-by-
        covered commodity basis to receive revenue loss coverage 
        payments for each covered commodity in accordance with this 
        subsection. If any of the owners of the farm make different 
        elections on the same covered commodity on the farm, all of the

                    (B) the county revenue loss coverage trigger for 
                the crop year for the covered commodity.
            (3) Time for payments.--If the Secretary determines under 
        this subsection that revenue loss coverage payments are 
        required to be provided for the covered commodity, payments 
        shall be made beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable 
        thereafter, after the end of the applicable marketing year for 
        the covered commodity.
            (4) Actual county revenue.--The amount of the actual county

                    (A) the actual county yield, as determined by the 
                Secretary, for each planted acre for the crop year for 
                the covered commodity; and
                    (B) the higher of--
                            (i) the midseason price; or

                        marketing assistance loan for the covered 
                        commodity in effect for crop years 2014 through

                    (A) In general.--The county revenue loss coverage 
                trigger for a crop year for a covered commodity on a 
                farm shall equal 85 percent of the benchmark county 
                revenue.
                    (B) Benchmark county revenue.--

                                most recent 5 crop years, excluding 
                                each of the crop years with the highest 
                                and lowest yields; and
                                    (II) subject to clause (iii), the 
                                average national marketing year average 
                                price for the most recent 5 crop years, 
                                excluding each of the crop years with 
                                the highest and lowest prices.
                            (ii) Yield conditions.--If the historical

                        most recent crop years, as determined by the 
                        Secretary, is less than 70 percent of the 
                        transitional yield, as determined by the 
                        Secretary, the amounts used for any of those 
                        years in clause (i)(I) shall be 70 percent of 
                        the transitional yield.
                            (iii) Reference price.--If the national 
                        marketing year average price in clause (i)(II) 
                        for any of the 5 most recent crop years is 
                        lower than the reference price for the covered 
                        commodity, the Secretary shall use the 
                        reference price for any of those years for the 
                        amounts in clause (i)(II).
            (6) Payment rate.--The payment rate shall be equal to the 
        lesser of--

        under this subsection are required to be provided for any of 
        the 2014 through 2018 crop years of a covered commodity, the

        the producers on a farm for the crop year shall be equal to the 
        product obtained by multiplying--
                    (A) the payment rate under paragraph (6); and
                    (B) the payment acres of the covered commodity on 
                the farm.
            (8) Duties of the secretary.--In providing revenue loss

                revenue loss coverage payments;
                    (C) to the maximum extent practicable, shall 
                calculate a separate county revenue loss coverage

                commodities and a separate actual county revenue for 
                irrigated and nonirrigated covered commodities;
                    (D) shall assign a benchmark county yield for each 
                planted acre for the crop year for the covered 
                commodity on the basis of the yield history of 
                representative farms in the State, region, or crop 
                reporting district, as determined by the Secretary, 
                if--
                            (i) the Secretary cannot establish the 
                        benchmark county yield for each planted acre 
                        for a crop year for a covered commodity in the

                            (ii) the yield determined under paragraph 
                        (5) is an unrepresentative average yield for 
                        the county (as determined by the Secretary); 
                        and
                    (E) to the maximum extent practicable, shall ensure 
                that in order to be eligible for a payment under this 
                subsection, the producers on the farm suffered an

SEC. 1413. PRODUCTION HISTORY OF PARTICIPATING DAIRY PRODUCERS.

    (a) Production History for Basic Margin Protection.--
            (1) Determination required.--For purposes of providing 
        basic margin protection, the Secretary shall determine the 
        basic production history of the dairy operation of each 
        participating dairy producer in the margin protection program.
            (2) Calculation.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), the 
        basic production history of a participating dairy producer for 
        basic margin protection is equal to the highest annual milk 
        marketings of the dairy producer during any one of the three 
        calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which 
        the dairy producer first signed up to participate in the margin 
        protection program.
            (3) Election by new producers.--If a participating dairy 
        producer has been in operation for less than a year, the dairy 
        producer shall elect one of the following methods for the 
        Secretary to determine the basic production history of the 
        dairy producer:
                    (A) The volume of the actual milk marketings for 
                the months the dairy producer has been in operation 
                extrapolated to a yearly amount.
                    (B) An estimate of the actual milk marketings of 
                the dairy producer based on the herd size of the 
                producer relative to the national rolling herd average 
                data published by the Secretary.
            (4) No change in production history for basic margin 
        protection.--Once the basic production history of a 
        participating dairy producer is determined under paragraph (2) 
        or (3), the basic production history shall not be subsequently 
        changed for purposes of determining the amount of any basic 
        margin protection payments for the dairy producer made under 
        section 1414.
    (b) Annual Production History for Supplemental Margin Protection.--
            (1) Determination required.--For purposes of providing 
        supplemental margin protection for a participating dairy 
        producer that purchases supplemental margin protection for a 
        year under section 1415, the Secretary shall determine the 
        annual production history of the dairy operation of the dairy 
        producer under paragraph (2).
            (2) Calculation.--The annual production history of a 
        participating dairy producer for a year is equal to the actual 
        milk marketings of the dairy producer during the preceding 
        calendar year.
            (3) New producers.--Subsection (a)(3) shall apply with 
        respect to determining the annual production history of a 
        participating dairy producer that has been in operation for 
        less than a year.
    (c) Required Information.--A participating dairy producer shall 
provide all information that the Secretary may require in order to 
establish--
            (1) the basic production history of the dairy operation of 
        the dairy producer under subsection (a); and
            (2) the production history of the dairy operation of the 
        dairy producer whenever the producer purchases supplemental 
        margin protection under section 1415.
    (d) Transfer of Production Histories.--
            (1) Transfer by sale or lease.--In promulgating the rules 
        to initiate the margin protection program, the Secretary shall 
        specify the conditions under which and the manner by which the 
        production history of a dairy operation may be transferred by 
        sale or lease.
            (2) Coverage level.--
                    (A) Basic margin protection.--A purchaser or lessee 
                to whom the Secretary transfers a basic production 
                history under this subsection shall not obtain a 
                different level of basic margin protection than the 
                basic margin protection coverage held by the seller or 
                lessor from whom the transfer was obtained.
                    (B) Supplemental margin protection.--A purchaser or 
                lessee to whom the Secretary transfers an annual 
                production history under this subsection shall not 
                obtain a different level of supplemental margin 
                protection coverage than the supplemental margin 
                protection coverage in effect for the seller or lessor 
                from whom the transfer was obtained for the calendar 
                year in which the transfer was made.
    (e) Movement and Transfer of Production History.--
            (1) Movement and transfer authorized.--Subject to paragraph 
        (2), if a dairy producer moves from one location to another 
        location, the dairy producer may maintain the basic production 
        history and annual production history associated with the 
        operation.
            (2) Notification requirement.--A dairy producer shall 
        notify the Secretary of any move of a dairy operation under 
        paragraph (1).
            (3) Subsequent occupation of vacated location.--A party 
        subsequently occupying a dairy operation location vacated as 
        described in paragraph (1) shall have no interest in the basic 
        production history or annual production history previously 
        associated with the operation at such location.

            (2) Amount of payment.--The basic margin protection payment 
        for the dairy operation of a participating dairy producer for a 
        consecutive two-month period shall be determined as follows:
                    (A) The Secretary shall calculate the difference 
                between the average actual dairy producer margin for 
                the consecutive two-month period and $4.00, except 
                that, if the difference is more than $4.00, the 
                Secretary shall use $4.00.
                    (B) The Secretary shall multiply the amount under 
                subparagraph (A) by the lesser of the following:
                            (i) 80 percent of the production history of 
                        the dairy producer, divided by six.
                            (ii) The actual amount of milk marketed by 
                        the dairy operation of the dairy producer

of the income of a participating dairy producer than the income level 
guaranteed by basic margin protection under section 1414.
    (b) Selection of Payment Threshold.--A participating dairy producer 
purchasing supplemental margin protection for a year shall elect a 
coverage level that is higher, in any increment of $0.50, than the 
payment threshold for basic margin protection specified in section 
1414(b), but not to exceed $8.00.
    (c) Selection of Coverage Percentage.--A participating dairy 
producer purchasing supplemental margin protection for a year shall 
elect a percentage of coverage equal to not more than 90 percent, nor 
less than 25 percent, of the annual production history of the dairy

                under subsection (c);
                    (B) the annual production history of the dairy 
                producer; and
                    (C) the premium per hundredweight of milk, as 
                specified in the applicable table under paragraph (2)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

            (4) Time for payment.--In promulgating the rules to 
        initiate the margin protection program, the Secretary shall 
        provide more than one method by which a participating dairy 
        producer that purchases supplemental margin protection for a 
        calendar year may pay the premium under this subsection for 
        that year that maximizes producer payment flexibility and 
        program integrity.
    (e) Producer's Premium Obligations.--
            (1) Pro-ration of premium for new producers.--A dairy 
        producer described in section 1412(c)(2) that purchases 
        supplemental margin protection for a calendar year after the 
        start of the calendar year shall pay a pro-rated premium for 
        that calendar year based on the portion of the calendar year 
        for which the producer purchases the coverage.
            (2) Legal obligation.--A participating dairy producer that 
        purchases supplemental margin protection for a calendar year 
        shall be legally obligated to pay the applicable premium for 
        that calendar year, except that, if the dairy producer retires, 
        the producer may request that Secretary cancel the supplemental 
        margin protection if the producer has terminated the dairy 
        operation entirely and certifies under oath that the producer 
        will not be actively engaged in any dairy operation for at 
        least the next seven years.
    (f) Supplemental Payment Threshold.--A participating dairy producer 
with supplemental margin protection shall receive a supplemental margin 
protection payment whenever the average actual dairy producer margin 
for a consecutive two-month period is less than the coverage level 
threshold selected by the dairy producer under subsection (b).
    (g) Supplemental Margin Protection Payments.--
            (1) In general.--The supplemental margin protection payment 
        for a participating dairy producer is in addition to the basic 
        margin protection payment.
            (2) Amount of payment.--The supplemental margin protection 
        payment for the dairy operation of a participating dairy 
        producer shall be determined as follows:
                    (A) The Secretary shall calculate the difference 
                between the coverage level threshold selected by the 
                dairy producer under subsection (b) and the greater 
                of--
                            (i) the average actual dairy producer 
                        margin for the consecutive two-month period; or
                            (ii) $4.00.
                    (B) The amount determined under subparagraph (A) 
                shall be multiplied by the percentage selected by the 
                participating dairy producer under subsection (c) and 
                by the lesser of the following:
                            (i) The annual production history of the 
                        dairy operation of the dairy producer, divided 
                        by six.
                            (ii) The actual amount of milk marketed by 
                        the dairy operation of the dairy producer 
                        during the consecutive two-month period.

program to encourage producers to address priority resource concerns in 
a comprehensive manner--

in the conservation stewardship program, a producer shall submit to the 
Secretary a contract offer for the agricultural operation that--

            ``(2) would, at a minimum, meet or exceed the stewardship 
        threshold for at least 1 additional priority resource concern

        priority to any application because the applicant is willing to 
        accept a lower payment than the applicant would otherwise be 
        eligible to receive.

evaluation criteria under subsection (b), the Secretary shall enter 
into a conservation stewardship contract with the producer to enroll 
the eligible land to be covered by the contract.
