SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On March 1, 2014, Russian Federation President Vladimir 
        Putin sought and received from the upper house of the Russian 
        parliament the standing authorization of the use of military 
        force to send Russian forces into Ukrainian territory.
            (2) On March 2, 2014, Russian troops invaded the Ukrainian 
        territory of Crimea, seizing control of the peninsula, border 
        crossings, government and administrative buildings, key 
        infrastructure, and surrounding Ukrainian military bases.
            (3) From February 26 to March 3, 2014, President Putin 
        directed exercises of 150,000 troops, including air and naval 
        forces, and live fire demonstrations in western Russia, near 
        the border with Ukraine.
            (4) On March 3, 2014, the Department of Defense announced 
        it was suspending United States military engagement with 
        Russia.
            (5) On March 12, 2014, in response to Russian aggression 
        and provocations, the United States deployed additional F-15 
        aircraft to NATO's Baltic Air Policing Mission and F-16 
        aircraft to an aviation detachment in Poland.
            (6) On March 16, 2014, Crimea held a referendum on seceding 
        from Ukraine and accede to the Russian Federation, which 
        violated the Ukrainian constitution, occurred under duress of 
        Russian military intervention, and was not recognized by the 
        international community.
            (7) On March 20, 2014, the Russian parliament voted to 
        annex Crimea and Russian President Putin signed the treaty of 
        accession annexing Crimea to the Russian Federation.
            (8) On March 23, 2014, NATO Supreme Allied Command and 
        Commander of U.S. European Command, General Philip Breedlove 
        stated that the Russian ``force that is at the Ukrainian border 
        now to the east is very, very sizeable and very, very ready''.
            (9) The Government of the Federation of Russian continues 
        to provoke demonstrations and violence in Ukraine in order to 
        create a false narrative of separatism and illegal 
        justification for Russian intervention.
            (10) On April 3, 2014, NATO Supreme Allied Commander and 
        Commander of U.S. European Command, General Philip Breedlove, 
        stated that Russia has 40,000 troops capable of moving within 
        12 hours with elements of a Combined Arms Army, supported by 
        fixed-wing aircraft, rotary aircraft, and the logistics 
        required in order to successfully make an incursion.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the continuing and long-standing pattern and practice 
        by the Government of the Russian Federation of physical, 
        diplomatic, and economic aggression toward neighboring 
        countries is clearly intended to undermine regional security 
        and stability;
            (2) the Russian military build-up and aggressive posture on 
        the eastern border of Ukraine represents a deliberate intent to 
        intimidate Ukraine and its citizens to submit to Russian 
        control;
            (3) the Russian Federation should immediately cease all 
        improper and illegal activities in Ukraine, including the 
        seizures of airfields and other locations, and President Putin 
        should direct an immediate return of Russian forces to their 
        barracks;
            (4) the United States reaffirms its strong commitment to 
        the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances which was 
        executed jointly with the Russian Federation and the United 
        Kingdom to explicitly secure the independence, sovereignty, and 
        territorial integrity and borders of Ukraine;
            (5) the United States supports the continued 
        professionalization of the Ukrainian military and should 
        enhance United States direct security cooperation with the 
        Ukrainian military;
            (6) the United States reaffirms its defense commitments to 
        its treaty allies under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty;
            (7) the United States supports the expansion of security 
        cooperation with states in Central and Eastern Europe, 
        including NATO member states, NATO aspirants, and appropriate 
        Eastern Partnership countries;
            (8) the United States should seek immediate membership in 
        NATO for Montenegro, a NATO Membership Action Plan for Georgia, 
        a diplomatic solution to disputes between Macedonia and Greece, 
        and seek resolution to the constitutional issues of Bosnia and 
        Herzegovina;
            (9) the United States reaffirms its support for the Supreme 
        Allied Commander of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe 
        to support NATO efforts to resolve the conflict peacefully and 
        diplomatically;
            (10) the United States encourages the North Atlantic 
        Council to act in a timely manner to direct the Supreme Allied 
        Commander of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe to 
        begin the NATO Defense Planning Process to NATO contingency 
        plans in response to a Russian invasion of Ukraine, including 
        in Crimea, and establish political guidance and determine 
        military capability requirements to effectively posture NATO 
        military forces; and
            (11) the United States should take immediate steps to 
        enhance its military presence and readiness posture in Europe 
        to deter aggression and assure allies and partners through 
        forward presence and engagement.
