  <summary>12/12/2013--Introduced.
Viral Hepatitis Testing Act of 2013 - Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to carry out surveillance, education, and testing programs with respect to hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) virus infections.

Requires the Secretary to establish a national system with respect to HBV and HCV to: (1) determine the prevalence of such infections; (2) carry out testing programs to increase the number of individuals who are aware of their infection; (3) disseminate public information and education programs for the detection and control of such infections; (4) improve the training of health professionals in the detection, control, and treatment of such infections; and (5) provide referrals for counseling and medical treatment and ensure the provision of follow-up services. Directs the Secretary to determine the populations that are considered at high risk.

Directs the Secretary to establish and support public-private partnerships that facilitate such HBV and HCV surveillance, education, screening, testing, and linkage to care programs.

Requires the Director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to convene the Preventive Services Task Force every three years to review its recommendation for HBV and HCV screening.

Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to establish and carry out a plan to provide veterans who were born between 1945 and 1965 with an HBC risk assessment and, if they are diagnosed with such virus, a thorough evaluation of, and information regarding, their need for treatment, vaccination, or other therapy.

Requires the VA to use compliance with such plan as a key performance measure under the VA Handbook Performance Management System or its successor, including by giving the director of a VA medical facility that is not fully compliant a less than fully successful performance appraisal.</summary>
