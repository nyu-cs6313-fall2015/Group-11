  <summary>9/18/2014--Introduced.
Safer Trucks and Buses Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to ensure that covered motor carrier data is not made available to the public, and prohibits such data from being used in a civil action for damages resulting from an incident involving a motor carrier, until the Secretary submits a report certifying that recommendations required by this Act have been implemented.

Defines "covered motor carrier data" as data generated with respect to a motor carrier under the Compliance, Safety, Accountability initiative of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.

 Requires the Secretary to submit to Congress a report that contains recommendations on how to improve such initiative, including by ensuring that it:

 utilizes and generates only safety data and scores determined to be predictive of motor carrier accidents, appropriately addresses concerns relating to the age of utilized safety data, does not unfairly harm small motor carriers as a result of limited safety data availability, appropriately addresses differences between motor carriers transporting passengers and those transporting freight, generates safety data that allows individual motor carriers and their safety scores to be effectively compared, and utilizes accurate safety data. Establishes deadlines for such report, for implementation of such recommendations, and for certification of such implementation.</summary>
