Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that:
            (1) The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is not 
        adequately informing property owners and local officials on the 
        certificate application approval process.
            (2) The current certificate application approval process at 
        the Commission does not include adequate State and local 
        participation.
            (3) The current certificate application approval process at 
        the Commission does not provide adequate protections for local 
        environmental resources.
            (4) An office of public advocate is necessary to properly 
        represent the interests of property owners and other affected 
        parties during the certificate application approval process, 
        and to properly inform property owners and other parties of 
        their rights during the process, and to provide proper guidance 
        to State and local officials during the process.

        effectively achieve the goals, purposes, and functions of the 
        office and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
