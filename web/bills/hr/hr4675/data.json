Defines \"student housing facilities\" to include facilities that are campus facilities and facilities that are noncampus buildings or properties.\n\nRequires IHEs that maintain student housing facilities to:\n\n include in all materials relating to such facilities information on whether they are equipped with a fire safety system that includes an automatic fire sprinkler system in each bedroom, give students who are selecting a student housing facility written notice as to whether or not the facility has such a system, and give students written notice on the date they move into a student housing facility as to whether the facility has such a system and how its fire safety system is described in the IHE's annual fire safety report."
