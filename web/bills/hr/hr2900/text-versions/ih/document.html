            ``(1) Primary state.--The term `primary State' means, with 
        respect to individual or group health insurance coverage 
        offered by a health insurance issuer, the State designated by 
        the issuer as the State whose covered laws shall govern the 
        health insurance issuer in the sale of such coverage under this 
        part. An issuer, with respect to a particular policy, may only 
        designate one such State as its primary State with respect to 
        all such coverage it offers. Such an issuer may not change the 
        designated primary State with respect to individual or group 
        health insurance coverage once the policy is issued, except 
        that such a change may be made upon renewal of the policy. With

        doing business in that State.
            ``(2) Secondary state.--The term `secondary State' means, 
        with respect to individual or group health insurance coverage 
        offered by a health insurance issuer, any State that is not the 
        primary State. In the case of a health insurance issuer that is 
        selling a policy in, or to a resident of, a secondary State, 
        the issuer is deemed to be doing business in that secondary 
        State.
            ``(3) Health insurance issuer.--The term `health insurance 
        issuer' has the meaning given such term in section 2791(b)(2), 
        except that such an issuer must be licensed in the primary 
        State and be qualified to sell individual health insurance 
        coverage in that State.
            ``(4) Individual health insurance coverage.--The term 
        `individual health insurance coverage' means health insurance 
        coverage offered in the individual market, as defined in 
        section 2791(e)(1).
            ``(5) Group health insurance coverage.--The term `group 
        health insurance coverage' has the meaning given such term in 
        2791(b)(4).
            ``(6) Applicable state authority.--The term `applicable 
        State authority' means, with respect to a health insurance 
        issuer in a State, the State insurance commissioner or official 
        or officials designated by the State to enforce the 
        requirements of this title for the State with respect to the 
        issuer.
            ``(7) Hazardous financial condition.--The term `hazardous 
        financial condition' means that, based on its present or 
        reasonably anticipated financial condition, a health insurance 
        issuer is unlikely to be able--
                    ``(A) to meet obligations to policyholders with
