Appropriates to such Fund amounts equivalent to the fees received in the Treasury before January 1, 2019, under this Act.\n\nRequires 85% of amounts in the Fund to be available to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for making capitalization grants under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act or CWA), and 15% to be available to the Secretary of the Treasury for carrying out the innovative financing program established under this Act.\n\nProhibits amounts in the Fund from being made available for a fiscal year unless the amount of funds appropriated to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund through annual capitalization grants is not less than the average of the annual amounts provided in capitalization grants under the CWA for the immediately preceding five-fiscal-year period.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) implement a program under which the Secretary provides a label suitable for placement on products (for a fee of three cents per unit) to inform consumers that the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the product and other stakeholders participate in the Fund and are contributing to America's clean water; and (2) deposit amounts received in the Treasury.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) establish an innovative financing program to make financial assistance available for projects eligible for assistance from a state water pollution control revolving fund established pursuant to the CWA, and (2) model the program after the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 program."
