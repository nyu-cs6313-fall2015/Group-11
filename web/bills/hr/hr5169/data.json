Expands the grounds for suspension or termination of an SES employee to include such cause as would promote the efficiency of the SES.\n\nRequires: (1) a written decision of an adverse action to be rendered not later than 30 days after the employee's answer to such action is received, and (2) any SES employee who is terminated from service to repay any salary received and forfeit any annual leave accumulated during the period of any adverse action leading to termination."
