SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Department of Homeland Security does not 
        consistently implement its policies and Government and private 
        sector best practices for acquisitions and procurement.
            (2) It is difficult to determine the cost of the 
        Department's major acquisition programs because the Department 
        has not provided consistent, comparable updates on an annual 
        basis. As of January 2014, the Department identified over 80 
        major acquisition programs costing over $300,000,000, and, 
        based on 2011, estimates it plans to spend about 
        $170,000,000,000 in the future on major acquisition programs.
            (3) Since 2005, the Government Accountability Office has 
        placed Department acquisition management activities on its 
        ``High-Risk List'', which identifies Government operations that 
        have greater susceptibility to fraud, waste, abuse, and 
        mismanagement or greater need for transformation to address 
        economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.
            (4) While the Department has taken actions to address some 
        high-risk acquisition program management issues, many programs 
        continue to experience challenges with funding instability, 
        workforce shortfalls, reliable cost estimates, realistic 
        schedules, agreed-upon baseline objectives, and consistent and 
        reliable data needed to accurately measure program performance.
            (5) Of the 77 Department major acquisition programs in 
        2011, the Government Accountability Office identified 42 
        programs that experienced cost growth, schedule slips, or both. 
        The Department reported that the magnitude of the cost growth 
        for 16 of the 42 programs, which increased from almost 
        $20,000,000,000 to over $50,000,000,000 in 2011, had an 
        aggregate increase of 166 percent.
            (6) In 2012, the Government Accountability Office found 
        that only 20 of 63 programs had Department-approved acquisition 
        program baselines. The Government Accountability Office also 
        reported that the Department planned to spend more than $105 
        billion on programs lacking acquisition program baselines.
