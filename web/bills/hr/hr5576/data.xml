USAccounts: Investing in America's Future Act of 2014 - Establishes in the Treasury the USAccount Fund to make contributions to accounts known as USAccounts, which are established under this Act for each child of a taxpayer&#160;qualifying for the child tax credit who has not attained age 17. Provides for an initial government contribution of $500 to a USAccount, private contributions&#160;up to $2,000, and&#160;government matching contributions up to $500 in a calendar year. Allows tax-exempt distributions from USAccounts&#160;for higher education expenses and for funding individual retirement plans of a qualifying child.

Establishes in the executive branch a USAccount Fund Board to&#160;manage investments in the USAccount Fund.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) exempt the USAccount Fund and USAccounts from income taxation, and (2) increase the amount of the child tax credit by the applicable USAccount contribution amount.</summary>
