                between the majority and minority leaders or their 
                designees. A motion to further limit debate is in order

                debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the 
                Senate. A vote on the final passage of the joint 
                resolution shall be taken in the Senate on or before 
                the close of the tenth calendar day after the date of 
                the introduction of the joint resolution in the Senate.

                                shall be the same as if no joint 
                                resolution had been received from the 
                                other House until the vote on passage;

        subsection is enacted by Congress--
                    ``(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power in the 
                Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, and 
                as such it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, 
                respectively, but applicable only with respect to the 
                procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a 
                joint resolution, and it supersedes other rules only to 
                the extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and
