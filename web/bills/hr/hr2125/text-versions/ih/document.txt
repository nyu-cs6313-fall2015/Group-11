                                 A BILL


 
        To prevent implementation and enforcement of Obamacare.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No IRS Implementation of Obamacare 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Between March 2010 and May 2012, the Internal Revenue 
        Service (hereafter referred to as the ``IRS'') engaged in 
        specific targeting of conservative groups that submitted 
        501(c)(4) applications.
            (2) IRS employees searched terms such as ``patriots'' and 
        ``tea party'' and purposefully singled out these small-
        government organizations for additional scrutiny and delay.
            (3) The IRS sat on applications from over 75 conservative 
        groups for months, and in some cases, even years while sending 
        them exhaustive questionnaires delaying their approval for as 
        long as possible.
            (4) This blatant breach of the public's trust and misuse of 
        taxpayer money runs counter to the core function of the IRS to 
        collect taxes from U.S. citizens regardless of their political 
        affiliations.
            (5) The IRS is responsible for implementing the tax 
        increases of Obamacare.
            (6) The IRS will make the final decisions of who is 
        eligible for subsidies after sharing taxpayer information with 
        the Department of Health and Human Services.
            (7) A healthy democracy is one where people feel free to 
        express their views, not one where Federal agencies 
        discriminate based on political beliefs.

SEC. 3. PREVENTION OF IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF OBAMACARE BY 
              IRS.

    The Secretary of the Treasury, or any delegate of the Secretary, 
shall not implement or enforce any provisions of Public Law 111-148 and 
Public Law 111-152 (other than subtitle A of title II thereof).

SEC. 4. PREVENTION OF USE OF TAXPAYER FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT OR ENFORCE 
              OBAMACARE.

    No taxpayer funds shall be used for the implementation or 
enforcement of Public Law 111-148 and Public Law 111-152 (other than 
subtitle A of title II thereof).
                                 <all>
