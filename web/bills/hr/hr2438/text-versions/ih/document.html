        ordnance across the range of intended operational environments; 
        and
            (2) the policy applicable to the use of the cluster 
        munitions requires that the cluster munitions--
                    (A) will only be used against clearly defined 
                military targets; and
                    (B) will not be used in locations where civilian 
                noncombatants are known to be present or in areas 
                normally inhabited by civilian noncombatants.
    (b) Presidential Waiver Authority.--
            (1) Limited waiver authority.--The President may waive the 
        limitation imposed by subsection (a)(1) if, before authorizing 
        the use of cluster munitions in a certain situation, the 
        President certifies that use of the cluster munitions in such 
        situation is vital to protect the security of the United 
        States.
            (2) Congressional notification.--Not later than 30 days 
        after the date on which the President makes a certification

        form if necessary, describing in detail--
                    (A) the reasons for the certification;
                    (B) the steps that were taken or will be taken to 
                protect civilian noncombatants against contact with the 
                cluster munitions; and
                    (C) the failure rate of the cluster munitions and 
                whether the cluster munitions are fitted with self-
                destruct or self-deactivation devices.
            (3) No delegation.--The President may not delegate the 
        authority to make a certification under paragraph (1).

SEC. 203. LIMITATION ON USE OF CLUSTER MUNITIONS WHEN USE IS REASONABLY

    (a) Limitation.--In addition to the limitation on the use of 
cluster munitions applicable under section 202(a), and notwithstanding 
any other provision of law, the President, head of any Federal 
department or agency, or general officer or flag officer of the Armed 
Forces may not authorize the use of any cluster munitions if the use of 
the cluster munitions is reasonably likely to unintentionally harm any 
citizen of the United States or citizen of a strategic treaty ally of 
the United States.
    (b) Presidential Waiver Authority.--
            (1) Limited waiver authority.--The President may waive the 
        limitation imposed by subsection (a) if, before authorizing the 
        use of cluster munitions, the President certifies that, 
        notwithstanding the risk to any citizen of the United States or 
        citizen of a strategic treaty ally of the United States, use of 
        the cluster munitions is vital to protect the security of the 
        United States.
            (2) Congressional notification.--Not later than 30 days 
        after the date on which the President makes a certification 
        under paragraph (1), the President shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a report, in classified 
        form if necessary, describing in detail--
                    (A) the reasons for the certification;
                    (B) the steps that were taken or will be taken to 
                prevent unintentional harm to any citizen of the United 
                States or citizen of a strategic treaty ally of the 
                United States; and
                    (C) the failure rate of the cluster munitions and 
                whether the cluster munitions are fitted with self-
                destruct or self-deactivation devices.
            (3) No delegation.--The President may not delegate the 
        authority to make a certification under paragraph (1).
    (c) Rule of Construction.--For the purposes of this section, use of 
cluster munitions is reasonably likely to unintentionally harm a United 
States citizen or a citizen of a strategic treaty ally in any situation 
in which any citizen of the United States or any citizen of a strategic 
treaty ally is known to be within a two-mile radius of the area to be 
targeted with cluster munitions.

SEC. 204. CLEANUP PLAN.

    Not later than 90 days after the date on which any cluster 
munitions are used by a Federal department or agency or the Armed 
Forces consistent with this title, the President shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees a plan for cleaning up any of the 
cluster munitions and submunitions that fail to explode and, therefore, 
continue to pose a hazard to civilian noncombatants.

SEC. 205. PROVISION OF CLUSTER MUNITIONS TO FOREIGN NATIONS.

    The President, head of any Federal department or agency, or general 
officer or flag officer of the Armed Forces may not provide any cluster 
munitions to a foreign nation, agency, or armed forces unless--
            (1) the cluster munitions to be provided will be used in a 
        combined military operation with the United States; and
            (2) the use of the cluster munitions complies with the 
        provisions of this title.
