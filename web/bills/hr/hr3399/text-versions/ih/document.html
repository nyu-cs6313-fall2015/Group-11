    (a) Academic Counseling and Educational Information Service.--
Section 3697A of title 38, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``counseling services, 
        including'' and inserting ``a program of counseling services, 
        to be known as the `Academic Counseling and Educational

            (2) in subsection (e), by adding at the end the following: 
        ``In making such information available under this subsection, 
        the Secretary shall make available information about the 
        definitions, eligibility requirements, and services provided 
        under this section and information about how the counseling 
        services provided under this section differ from the services 
        provided under section 3104(a)(2) of this title. At a minimum, 
        the Secretary shall make such information available to an 
        individual described in subsection (b) before the individual 
        applies for educational assistance described in subsection 
        (b)(1).''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new subsections:
    ``(f) The Secretary shall maintain an Internet website on which--
            ``(1) a person is able to request counseling services under 
        this section in such a manner that clearly distinguishes such 
        services from counseling services available under section 
        3104(a)(2) of this title; and
            ``(2) an individual receiving counseling services under 
        this section is able to receive such services using a web-based 
        counseling tool and to confidentially access aptitude tests.
    ``(g) The primary goal of the counseling services provided under 
this section is to provide to individuals with assistance in--
            ``(1) pursuing postsecondary education and training 
        opportunities;
            ``(2) obtaining information regarding available 
        postsecondary educational and training opportunities;
            ``(3) obtaining career-related information and data on 
        available postsecondary educational and training opportunities;
            ``(4) selecting a program of education or training; and
            ``(5) addressing other needs relating to education.
    ``(h) Services provided under this section are different from the 
services provided under section 3104(a)(2) of this title and do not 
involve rehabilitation services.''.

            (1) Electronic application.--Section 3102 of such title is 
        amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:

            (2) Clarification regarding eligibility.--Veterans are only 
        eligible for counseling services provided under section 
        3104(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code, if they are 
        entitled to a rehabilitation program under chapter 31 of such 
        title. Not all veterans who are transitioning from service on 
        active duty in the Armed Forces are eligible for such services.
            (3) Goal of program.--The primary goal of the counseling 
        services provided under section 3104(a)(2) of title 38, United 
        States Code, is to help veterans eligible for such services to 
        prepare for, obtain, and retain employment.
