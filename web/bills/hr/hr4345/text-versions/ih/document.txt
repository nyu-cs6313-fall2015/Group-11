SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the State energy program established under part D of 
        title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 
        6321 et seq.) (referred to in this section as ``SEP'') and the 
        Weatherization Assistance Program for Low-Income Persons 
        established under part A of title IV of the Energy Conservation 
        and Production Act (42 U.S.C. 6861 et seq.) (referred to in 
        this section as ``WAP'') have proven to be beneficial, long-
        term partnerships among Federal, State, and local partners;
            (2) the SEP and the WAP have been reauthorized on a 
        bipartisan basis over many years to address changing national, 
        regional, and State circumstances and needs, especially 
        through--
                    (A) the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 
                U.S.C. 6201 et seq.);
                    (B) the Energy Conservation and Production Act (42 
                U.S.C. 6801 et seq.);
                    (C) the State Energy Efficiency Programs 
                Improvement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-440; 104 Stat. 
                1006);
                    (D) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13201 
                et seq.);
                    (E) the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 15801 
                et seq.); and
                    (F) the Energy Independence and Security Act of 
                2007 (42 U.S.C. 17001 et seq.);
            (3) the SEP, also known as the ``State energy conservation 
        program''--
                    (A) was first created in 1975 to implement a State-
                based, national program in support of energy 
                efficiency, renewable energy, economic development, 
                energy emergency preparedness, and energy policy; and
                    (B) has come to operate in every sector of the 
                economy in support of the private sector to improve 
                productivity and has dramatically reduced the cost of 
                government through energy savings at the State and 
                local levels;
            (4) Federal laboratory studies have concluded that, for 
        every Federal dollar invested through the SEP, more than $7 is 
        saved in energy costs and almost $11 in non-Federal funds is 
        leveraged;
            (5) the WAP--
                    (A) was first created in 1976 to assist low-income 
                families in response to the first oil embargo;
                    (B) has become the largest residential energy 
                conservation program in the United States, with more 
                than 7,100,000 homes weatherized since the WAP was 
                created;
                    (C) saves an estimated 35 percent of consumption in 
                the typical weatherized home, yielding average annual 
                savings of $437 per year in home energy costs;
                    (D) has created thousands of jobs in both the 
                construction sector and in the supply chain of 
                materials suppliers, vendors, and manufacturers who 
                supply the WAP;
                    (E) returns $2.51 in energy savings for every 
                Federal dollar spent in energy and nonenergy benefits 
                over the life of weatherized homes;
                    (F) serves as a foundation for residential energy 
                efficiency retrofit standards, technical skills, and 
                workforce training for the emerging broader market and 
                reduces residential and power plant emissions of carbon 
                dioxide by 2.65 metric tons each year per home; and
                    (G) has decreased national energy consumption by 
                the equivalent of 24,100,000 barrels of oil annually;
            (6) the WAP can be enhanced with the addition of a targeted 
        portion of Federal funds through an innovative program that 
        supports projects performed by qualified nonprofit 
        organizations that have a demonstrated capacity to build, 
        renovate, repair, or improve the energy efficiency of a 
        significant number of low-income homes;
            (7) the WAP has increased energy efficiency opportunities 
        by promoting new, competitive public-private sector models of 
        retrofitting low-income homes through new Federal partnerships;
            (8) improved monitoring and reporting of the work product 
        of the WAP has yielded benefits, and expanding independent 
        verification of efficiency work will support the long-term 
        goals of the WAP;
            (9) reports of the Government Accountability Office in 
        2011, Inspector General of the Department of Energy, and State 
        auditors have identified State-level deficiencies in monitoring 
        efforts that can be addressed in a manner that will ensure that 
        WAP funds are used more effectively;
            (10) through the history of the WAP, the WAP has evolved 
        with improvements in efficiency technology, including, in the 
        1990s, many States adopting advanced home energy audits, which 
        has led to great returns on investment; and
            (11) as the home energy efficiency industry has become more 
        performance-based, the WAP should continue to use those 
        advances in technology and the professional workforce.
