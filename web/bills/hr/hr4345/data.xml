Weatherization Enhancement, and Local Energy Efficiency Investment and Accountability Act - Amends the Energy Conservation and Production Act to extend the Weatherization Assistance Program for low-income persons through FY2019.

Requires the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to make competitive grants to qualified tax-exempt charitable organizations for energy efficiency retrofit uses that include:

 energy efficiency audits, cost-effective retrofit, and related weatherization activities; energy efficiency materials and supplies; training and technical assistance; information to homeowners on proper maintenance and energy savings behaviors; data collection, measurement, and verification activities to facilitate program monitoring, oversight, evaluation, and reporting; and management and administration. Requires contractors carrying out weatherization with funds under the Act to be selected through a competitive bidding process and be accredited as specified by this Act. Requires organizations, in order to receive a grant, to use a crew chief who is certified or accredited as required by this Act.

Requires the Secretary, beginning on October 1, 2015, to ensure that: (1) each retrofit for which weatherization assistance is provided meets minimum efficiency and quality of work standards established by the Secretary, (2) at least 10% of the dwelling units are randomly inspected by an accredited third party to ensure compliance with the standards, and (3) the standards meet or exceed the current industry standards for home performance work.

Amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to extend the program for state energy conservation plans through FY2019.</summary>
