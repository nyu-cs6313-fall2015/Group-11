System.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on 
Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Senate a report 
on the review under subsection (a). Such report shall include the 
following:
            (1) The number of pending cases that exist as of the date 
        of the report, listed by military department, component, and, 
        with respect to the National Guard, State.
            (2) As of the date of the report, the average time it takes 
        to process a case in the Integrated Disability Evaluation 
        System.
            (3) A description of the steps the Secretary will take to 
        resolve the backlog of cases in the Integrated Disability 
        Evaluation System.
            (4) With respect to each military department, the date by 
        which the Secretary plans to resolve such backlog.
            (5) The progress and estimated cost of moving the 
        Integrated Disability Evaluation System to an integrated and 
        readily accessible electronic format that a member of the Armed 
        Forces may access and see the status of the member during each 
        phase of the system.
            (6) An assessment by the Secretary of the feasibility of 
        improving in-transit visibility of pending cases, including by 
        establishing a method of tracking a pending case when a 
        military treatment facility is assigned a packet and pending 
        case for action of a member.
    (c) Pending Case Defined.--In this section, the term ``pending 
case'' means a case where a member of the Armed Forces who, as of the 
date of the review under subsection (a), is within the Integrated 
Disability Evaluation System and has been referred to a medical 
evaluation board.
