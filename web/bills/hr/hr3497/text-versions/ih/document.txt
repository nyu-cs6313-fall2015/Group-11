                        year is less than $100,000 (twice such amount 
                        in the case of a joint return), $10,000 (half 
                        such amount in the case of a separate return by 
                        a married individual), and
                            ``(ii) in any other case, $5,000 (half such 
                        amount in the case of a separate return by a 
                        married individual).''.
    (b) Modified Adjusted Gross Income.--Paragraph (2) of section 
129(a) of such Code is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraph:
                    ``(D) Modified adjusted gross income.--For purposes 
                of this paragraph, the term `modified adjusted gross 
                income' means the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer 
                for the taxable year increased by any amount excluded 
                from gross income under section 911, 931, or 933.''.

                taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2014, 
                each dollar amount contained in subparagraph (A) shall 
                be increased by an amount equal to--
                            ``(i) such dollar amount, multiplied by
                            ``(ii) the cost-of-living adjustment 
                        determined under section 1(f)(3) for the 
                        calendar year in which the taxable year begins, 
                        determined by substituting `calendar year 2013' 
                        for `calendar year 1992' in subparagraph (B) 
                        thereof.
                Any increase determined under the preceding sentence 
                shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50.''.
