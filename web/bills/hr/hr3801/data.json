Requires USPS, if it establishes such a schedule, to allow publishers of newspapers regularly mailed as periodicals access to curbside mailboxes on any day on which it does not deliver mail.\n\nRequires USPS to provide domestic competitive product service six days per week until January 1, 2019, to each street address that was scheduled to receive package service six days per week as of September 30, 2012."
