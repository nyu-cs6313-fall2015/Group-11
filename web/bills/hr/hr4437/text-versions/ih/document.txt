To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for pharmacy

                            other purposes.

SEC. 2. PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGER STANDARDS UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--Section 1860D-12(b) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395w-112(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
paragraphs:
            ``(7) Pharmacy benefits manager transparency 
        requirements.--Each contract entered into with a PDP sponsor 
        under this part with respect to a prescription drug plan 
        offered by such sponsor shall provide that the PDP may not 
        enter into a contract with any pharmacy benefits manager 
        (referred to in this paragraph as a `PBM') to manage the 
        prescription drug coverage provided under such plan, or to 
        control the costs of the prescription drug coverage under such 
        plan, unless the PBM adheres to the following criteria when 
        handling personally identifiable utilization and claims data or 
        other sensitive patient data:
                    ``(A) The PBM may not transmit any personally 
                identifiable utilization or claims data, with respect 
                to a plan enrollee, to a pharmacy owned by a PBM if the 
                plan enrollee has not voluntarily elected in writing or 
                via secure electronic means to fill that particular 
                prescription at the PBM-owned pharmacy.
                    ``(B) The PBM may not require that a plan enrollee 
                use a retail pharmacy, mail order pharmacy, specialty 
                pharmacy, or other pharmacy entity providing pharmacy 
                services in which the PBM has an ownership interest or 
                that has an ownership interest in the PBM or provide an 
                incentive to a plan enrollee to encourage the enrollee 
                to use a retail pharmacy, mail order pharmacy, 
                specialty pharmacy, or other pharmacy entity providing 
                pharmacy services in which the PBM has an ownership 
                interest or that has an ownership interest in the PBM, 
                if the incentive is applicable only to such 
                pharmacies.''.
    (b) Regular Update of Prescription Drug Pricing Standard.--
Paragraph (6) of section 1860D-12(b) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395w-112(b)) is amended to read as follows:
            ``(6) Regular update of prescription drug pricing 
        standard.--
                    ``(A) In general.--If the PDP sponsor of a 
                prescription drug plan uses a standard for 
                reimbursement (as described in subparagraph (B)) of 
                pharmacies based on the cost of a drug, each contract 
                entered into with such sponsor under this part with 
                respect to the plan shall provide that the sponsor 
                shall--
                            ``(i) update such standard not less 
                        frequently than once every 7 days, beginning 
                        with an initial update on January 1 of each 
                        year, to accurately reflect the market price of 
                        acquiring the drug;
                            ``(ii) disclose to applicable pharmacies 
                        the sources used for making any such update;
                            ``(iii) if the source for such a standard 
                        for reimbursement is not publicly available, 
                        disclose to the applicable pharmacies all 
                        individual drug prices to be so updated in 
                        advance of the use of such prices for the 
                        reimbursement of claims; and
                            ``(iv) establish a process to appeal, 
                        investigate, and resolve disputes regarding 
                        individual drug prices that are less than the 
                        pharmacy acquisition price for such drug.
                    ``(B) Prescription drug pricing standard defined.--
                For purposes of subparagraph (A), a standard for 
                reimbursement of a pharmacy is any methodology or 
                formula for varying the pricing of a drug or drugs 
                during the term of the pharmacy reimbursement contract 
                that is based on the cost of the drug involved, 
                including drug pricing references and amounts that are 
                based upon average wholesale price, wholesale average 
                cost, average manufacturer price, average sales price, 
                maximum allowable cost (MAC), or other costs, whether 
                publicly available or not.''.

apply to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2015.
