areas affected by Boko Haram through development of a regional strategy 
 to support multilateral efforts to successfully protect civilians and 
eliminate the threat posed by Boko Haram, to support efforts to rescue 
female students abducted in Nigeria on April 14, 2014, as well as other

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Boko Haram Disarmament and Northeast 
Nigeria Recovery Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On the night of April 14, 2014, 276 female students, 
        most of them between 15 and 18 years old, were abducted by Boko 
        Haram from the Chibok Government Girls Secondary School, a 
        boarding school located in Borno state in the Federal Republic 
        of Nigeria.
            (2) All public secondary schools in Borno state were closed 
        in March 2014 because of increasing attacks by Boko Haram that 
        killed hundreds of students, but the schoolgirls returned to 
        school, despite the potential dangers, determined to pursue 
        their education.
            (3) Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for subsequent 
        kidnappings in the region.
            (4) Boko Haram leaders have threatened to sell the 
        kidnapped schoolgirls into slavery and according to reports, 
        has previously kept female hostages as slaves and committed 
        sexual violence against them.
            (5) Boko Haram seems determined to carry out sophisticated 
        and deadly attacks and to expand its area of operation.
            (6) Boko Haram has targeted schools, mosques, churches, 
        villages, and agricultural centers, as well as government 
        facilities, in hopes of creating an Islamic state in northern 
        Nigeria.
            (7) There are estimates that Boko Haram has killed more 
        than 4,000 people since 2011, and more than 2,000 people this 
        year alone.
            (8) There is a possibility that many of the girls may have 
        been taken into neighboring countries.
            (9) Boko Haram and other terrorist organizations pose a 
        growing threat to United States interests in the region, as 
        well as to broader regional peace and security.
            (10) In an effort to locate the kidnapped schoolgirls, the 
        United States authorized the deployment of up to 80 military 
        personnel to Chad in order to help with intelligence and 
        surveillance.
            (11) The United States military have provided training, 
        equipment, and other support for counter-terrorism units in the 
        Sahel region to combat Al Qaeda affiliates and related groups 
        in Africa.
            (12) Cameroon, Niger, and Chad have deployed troops in an 
        effort to secure their borders against Boko Haram.
            (13) The United States named several individuals linked to 
        Boko Haram as Specially Designated Global Terrorists in 2012 
        and designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization 
        in November 2013.
            (14) On May 22, 2014, the United Nations Security Council 
        added Boko Haram to the 1267 sanctions list, a list of Al 
        Qaeda-linked terrorist organizations subject to weapons 
        embargoes, travel bans, and asset freezes.
            (15) The Senate and House have both passed resolutions 
        condemning Boko Haram and the abduction of female students by 
        the group from schools in the northeastern province of Borno in 
        the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

lasting resolution to the conflict in northeast Nigeria and other Boko

        beyond standard budget allocations to state and local 
        governments, for the task of combating Boko Haram and 
        rebuilding those regions affected by Boko Haram attacks.
    (c) Coordination With Other Donor Nations.--The United States 
should work with other donor nations, on a bilateral and multilateral

Nigeria and other areas affected by Boko Haram, and strengthen 
accountability mechanisms to ensure the transparent and timely use of 
those funds.
    (d) Termination of Assistance.--It is the sense of Congress that
