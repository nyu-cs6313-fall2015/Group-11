        General begins requiring the emergency production of such 
        tangible things, whichever is earliest.

        subsection may be reviewed as provided in this section.

        other case where the production of tangible things is 
        terminated and no order is issued approving the production, no 
        information obtained or evidence derived from such production 
        shall be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any 
        trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court,

        concerning any United States person acquired from such 
        production shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other 
        manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of 
        such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General 
        if the information indicates a threat of death or serious 
        bodily harm to any person.
            ``(6) The Attorney General shall assess compliance with the 
        requirements of paragraph (5).''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 501(d) (50 U.S.C. 1861(d)) is 
amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by
