               geothermal leases, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Exploring for Geothermal Energy on 
Federal Lands Act''.

SEC. 2. GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION NOTICE AND EXCLUSION.

    (a) Definition of Geothermal Exploration Test Project.--In this 
section the term ``geothermal exploration test project'' means the 
drilling of a well to test or explore for geothermal resources on lands 
leased by the Department of the Interior for the development and 
production of geothermal resources, that--
            (1) is carried out by the holder of the lease;
            (2) causes--
                    (A) less than 5 acres of soil or vegetation 
                disruption at the location of each geothermal 
                exploration well; and
                    (B) not more than an additional 5 acres of soil or 
                vegetation disruption during access or egress to the 
                test site;
            (3) is developed--
                    (A) no deeper than 2,500 feet;
                    (B) less than 8 inches in diameter;
                    (C) in a manner that does not require off-road 
                motorized access other than to and from the well site 
                along an identified off-road route for which notice is 
                provided to the Secretary of the Interior under 
                subsection (c);
                    (D) without construction of new roads other than 
                upgrading of existing drainage crossings for safety 
                purposes; and
                    (E) with the use of rubber-tired digging or 
                drilling equipment vehicles;
            (4) is completed in less than 45 days, including the 
        removal of any surface infrastructure from the site; and
            (5) requires the restoration of the project site within 3 
        years to approximately the condition that existed at the time 
        the project began, unless the site is subsequently used as part 
        of energy development on the lease.
    (b) NEPA Exclusion.--Section 102(2)(C) of the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) shall not apply 
with respect to a project that the Secretary of the Interior determines 
under subsection (c) is a geothermal exploration test project.
    (c) Notice of Intent; Review and Determination.--
            (1) Requirement to provide notice.--A leaseholder intending 
        to carry out a geothermal exploration test project shall 
        provide notice to the Secretary of the Interior not later than 
        30 days prior to the start of drilling under the project.
            (2) Review of project.--The Secretary shall by not later 
        than 10 days after receipt of a notice of intent under 
        paragraph (1) from a leaseholder--
                    (A) review the project described in the notice and 
                determine whether it is a geothermal exploration test 
                project under subsection (a); and
                    (B) notify the leaseholder--
                            (i) that under subsection (b) of this 
                        section, section 102(2)(C) of the National 
                        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
                        4332(2)(C)) does not apply to the project; or
                            (ii) that section 102(2)(C) of the National 
                        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
                        4332(2)(C)) applies to the project, including 
                        clear and detailed findings on any deficiencies 
                        in the project that preclude the application of 
                        subsection (b) of this section to the project.
            (3) Opportunity to remedy.--If the Secretary provides 
        notice under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) that section 102(2)(C) of the 
        National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
        4332(2)(C)) applies to the project, the Secretary shall provide 
        the leaseholder an opportunity to remedy the deficiencies 
        described in the notice prior to the date the leaseholder 
        intended to start drilling under the project.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
