(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Idaho Wilderness Water Resources Protection Act - Directs the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA) to issue a special use authorization for the continued operation and reconstruction of a water storage, transport, or diversion facility located on National Forest System land in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness and the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness in Idaho if:

 the facility was in existence on the date on which it was designated as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System; the facility has been in continuous use to deliver water for beneficial use on the owner's non-federal land; the owner holds a valid water right under state law that predates the designation; and relocating the facility is not practicable or feasible.</summary>
