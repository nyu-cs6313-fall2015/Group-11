                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 10, United States Code, to prohibit certain increases in 
         fees for military health care before fiscal year 2016.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Military Health Care Affordability 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) America's warriors offer a life of supreme devotion in 
        service to their Nation, and through generations of war-
        fighting, their dedication has proven honorable, their 
        sacrifice immeasurable, and their record of excellence 
        undeniable.
            (2) No American goes to war alone--the burden of every 
        Soldier, Sailor, Airman, and Marine is shared, in part, by all 
        of his or her loved ones.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) so long as the United States sends men and women into 
        battle, the United States will be faithful to care for them 
        upon their return;
            (2) as the veteran answered the call of duty, so too, is 
        the United States duty-bound to answer the call of the veteran;
            (3) the Department of Defense and the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs have the tools and ingenuity to provide 
        continued excellent health care without increasing TRICARE 
        payments from the veteran before fiscal year 2014; and
            (4) in the words of President Abraham Lincoln, ``let us 
        strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's 
        wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for 
        his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and 
        cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all 
        nations.''.
