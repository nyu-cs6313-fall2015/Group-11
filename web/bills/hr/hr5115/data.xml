Rural Veteran Access to Care Act - Provides for the reimbursement of the travel expenses a veteran with a service-connected disability incurs for the examination, treatment, or care for which the veteran is eligible. (Currently, that disability must be rated at 30% or more, unless the travel is in connection with the treatment or care of the disability or the veteran qualifies for such reimbursement on other grounds.)</summary>
