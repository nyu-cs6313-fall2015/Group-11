SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Migration Policy Institute, there are 
        13,400,000 non-citizen residents in the United States with 
        limited proficiency in English.
            (2) According to the Department of Homeland Security, 
        approximately 1,100,000 legal immigrants enter the country 
        annually. About half of these legal immigrants lack full 
        proficiency in English.
            (3) According to the Migration Policy Institute, an 
        estimated 70 percent of the unauthorized immigrant population 
        ages 19 and older have limited proficiency in English.
            (4) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 
        two-thirds of the foreign-born population does not have a 
        postsecondary degree, and foreign-born adults are three times 
        more likely to lack a high school diploma or equivalent than 
        native-born adults.
            (5) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 19 of the 
        30 fastest growing occupations require workers with some form 
        of postsecondary education or training.
            (6) These statistics suggest that a lack of English 
        proficiency and limited education serve as serious impediments 
        to labor market success for immigrants.
            (7) A century ago, during the last great wave of 
        immigration to this country, the public and private sectors 
        promoted the integration of newcomers through the Settlement 
        House movement, the founding of the modern public library 
        system, the establishment of universal public education.
            (8) Although currently dozens of Federal and State programs 
        support, and thousands of government agencies and nonprofit 
        organizations operate, programs that teach English, promote 
        acquisition of workforce skills, provide citizenship 
        assistance, and otherwise promote the integration of immigrants 
        and their children, such programs are often not coordinated or 
        aligned, limiting the capacity of such programs to identify and 
        test promising practices, leverage resources, or bring 
        effective interventions to scale.
            (9) It is in the national interest to facilitate the rapid 
        acquisition of English language skills by immigrants to the 
        United States and to otherwise promote the integration of 
        immigrants and their children into the mainstream of our 
        economy and society.
            (10) Empowering immigrants and their family members to 
        effectively integrate into the mainstream of the economic, 
        social, cultural, and civic life of their local communities and 
        the Nation as a whole will ensure that United States 
        immigration policies result in more productive and competitive 
        local economies and more cohesive and harmonious communities.
            (11) Data, policies, and programs relevant to immigrant 
        integration crosscut the responsibilities of numerous Federal 
        agencies as well as those of State and local governments and 
        nongovernmental actors.
            (12) The overlapping nature of integration issues and the 
        lack of coordination of immigration policies and programs make 
        it difficult for the President and Congress to understand and 
        respond to pressing integration challenges and opportunities.
            (13) Improved coordination of integration goals, policies, 
        and programs across sectors and levels of government would 
        greatly enhance the ability of the Federal Government to create 
        and maintain an immigration system that is more suited to 
        modern times and benefits the interests of the Federal 
        Government, communities with growing immigrant populations, as 
        well as immigrants and their family members.
    (b) Declaration of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
to--
            (1) promote the civic, linguistic, and economic integration 
        of immigrants and their young children into the United States;
            (2) establish national goals for integrating immigrants and 
        their young children into the United States, and measure the 
        degree to which such goals are met;
            (3) assess and coordinate Federal policies, regulations, 
        and programs related to the integration of immigrants, 
        including an assessment of Federal agency jurisdiction and 
        budget concerns;
            (4) consult with State and local governments on integration 
        challenges and opportunities for the purpose of improving 
        Federal integration policy and program efforts;
            (5) track the performance of Federal, State, and local 
        integration initiatives, including measures of reach, 
        effectiveness, and cost; and
            (6) engage stakeholders at different government and 
        nongovernment levels to identify integration opportunities and 
        challenges.
