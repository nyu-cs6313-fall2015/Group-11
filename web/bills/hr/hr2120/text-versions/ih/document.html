                    (A) had a voluntary curfew in effect for certain 
                aircraft on November 5, 1990; and
                    (B) was created by an intergovernmental agreement 
                established pursuant to a State statute enacted before 
                November 5, 1990, that, along with the statute, imposes

                    (A) the terms of the curfew; and
                    (B) the penalties for violating the curfew.
            (2) Reasonable notice.--An airport sponsor shall be treated
