under this section not later than 90 days after the date on which the 
Secretary concerned receives the petition.

            (4) the petition is from a State that had a previous 
        cooperative agreement terminated and the Secretary determines

        petition under subsection (b), the Secretary concerned shall

            (3) the amount to be contributed by the State shall be 
        determined by the Governor of the State and the Secretary

        and anticipated during the duration of the cooperative 
        agreement, of managing the qualifying Federal lands concerned, 
        including employee salary data;
            (4) in the event of a natural disaster, as categorized by 
        the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the State shall assume

        revenues related to the qualifying Federal lands concerned 
        shall be distributed to the State and Federal entities in 
        accordance to the percentages dictated by the cost-sharing 
        agreement and shall be used so that the percentage of funds

        Secretary concerned for use at the sole discretion of the 
        Secretary concerned;
            (6) the procedures to be followed for purposes of the

                the qualifying Federal lands concerned may remain 
                employed without infringement upon their existing 
                conditions of employment;
                    (B) a guarantee that the State may use its

                    (C) authority over the qualifying Federal lands 
                concerned shall be directed by the State that submitted 
                the petition and a State-appointed manager, but the 
                implementation of its directives may include the 
                existing Federal superintendent concerned and performed 
                in conjunction with State employees;
            (7) the transfer of any special use permits issued to the 
        Secretary concerned with respect to the qualifying Federal 
        lands concerned to the State;

        seq.)), shall remain open to mineral entry under State law 
        unless subsequently changed by a State mineral closing order; 
        and
            (9) if the qualifying Federal lands concerned cross State 
        lines, all States involved shall submit a joint petition or the 
        States must agree to divide the park by State lines to enable 
        State authority in accordance to the cost-sharing agreement.
    (h) Applicability of State Law on Qualifying Federal Lands Under 
Cooperative Agreement.--State environmental, wildlife, and land 
management laws shall supercede Federal environmental, wildlife, and 
land management laws on the qualifying Federal lands administered by a 
State under a cooperative agreement in place under this section to the 
extent that such laws are more restrictive than the corresponding 
Federal laws.
    (i) Ownership.--Notwithstanding a State management of qualified 
Federal lands under a cooperative agreement entered into under this 
section, the United States shall retain all right, title, and interest 
in and to such lands.

applicable under this section shall terminate, at the discretion of the 
Secretary concerned, under the following circumstances:
            (1) The State concerned defaults on a payment, thereby

        cooperative agreement as determined by the Secretary concerned.

        agreement is beneficial or in the best interest of the State, 
        the State must submit a petition to the Secretary concerned 
        exhibiting credible purpose and reason for such intent.
            (2) Not later than 90 days after receiving a petition under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall determine whether 
        to approve or deny the petition.
