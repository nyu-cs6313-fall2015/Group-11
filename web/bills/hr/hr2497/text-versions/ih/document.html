SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Casa Grande Ruin Reservation was set aside on March 2, 
        1889, proclaimed as the Nation's first archeological preserve 
        on June 22, 1892, and redesignated as Casa Grande Ruins 
        National Monument on August 3, 1918.
            (2) Casa Grande Ruins National Monument protects one of the 
        finest architectural examples of 13th Century Hohokam culture 
        in the American Southwest known to early Spanish explorers as 
        the ``Great House''.
            (3) Casa Grande is only part of the story of this ancient 
        town that may have covered 2 square miles.
