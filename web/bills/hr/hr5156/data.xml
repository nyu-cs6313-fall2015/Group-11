  <summary>7/17/2014--Introduced.
Wildlife Disease Emergency Act of 2014 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with governors of potentially affected states, to declare a wildlife disease emergency for any wildlife disease occurring within the United States or, if outside the United States, with the potential to enter the United States.

Defines "wildlife disease emergency" as the occurrence of a non-zoonotic pathological condition in a wildlife population that:

 is infectious and caused by a newly discovered pathogen or is a known infectious wildlife disease that is expanding in range or other impacts, or poses significant threats the wildlife sustainability or the overall health of a functioning ecosystem. Directs the Secretary, upon making such a declaration, to lead a coordinated response to the emergency.

 Directs the Secretary to implement a grant program to provide funding to state wildlife agencies and Indian tribes to address wildlife disease emergencies.

 Establishes in the Treasury a Wildlife Disease Emergency Fund.

 Allows the Secretary to establish a Wildlife Disease Committee to assist the Secretary in increasing the level of preparedness needed to address emerging wildlife diseases.

 Authorizes the Secretary to convene rapid response teams to address any particular wildlife disease emergency.</summary>
