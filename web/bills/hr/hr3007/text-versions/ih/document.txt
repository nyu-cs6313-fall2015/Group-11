        an examination to each veteran seeking a license or credential 
        issued by the State and issues such license or credential to 
        such veteran without requiring such veteran to undergo any 
        training or apprenticeship if the veteran--

                a military occupational specialty that, as determined 
                by the State, is similar to a civilian occupation for 
                which such license or credential is required by the 
                State; and
            ``(ii) submits each year to the Secretary a report on the 
        exams administered under clause (i) during the most recently 
        completed 12-month period that includes, for the period covered 
        by the report, the number of veterans who completed an exam

        the results of such exams, disaggregated by occupational field.

submit to Congress and the Secretary of Defense a report summarizing 
the information received by the Secretary under subparagraph 
(A)(ii).''.
    (b) Effective Date.--

        title, as added by subsection (a), shall take effect on the
