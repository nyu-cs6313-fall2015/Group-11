 To revise the boundaries of the Gettysburg National Military Park to 
include the Gettysburg Train Station and certain land along Plum Run in 
 Cumberland Township, to limit the means by which property within such 
      revised boundaries may be acquired, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. GETTYSBURG NATIONAL MILITARY PARK.

    (a) Boundary Revision.--Section 1 of the Act titled ``An Act to 
revise the boundary of Gettysburg National Military Park in the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and for other purposes'', approved August 
17, 1990 (16 U.S.C. 430g-4), is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subsection:
    ``(d) Additional Land.--
            ``(1) Covered land; condition.--In addition to the land 
        identified in subsections (a) and (b), the park shall include 
        the following, as depicted on the maps titled `Gettysburg 
        National Military Park Proposed Boundary Addition', numbered 
        305/80,045, and dated January 2010, if the owner of the 
        property has provided written consent to inclusion:
                    ``(A) The land and interests in land commonly known 
                as the `Gettysburg Train Station' and its immediate 
                surroundings in the Borough of Gettysburg.
                    ``(B) The land and interests in land located along 
                Plum Run in Cumberland Township.
            ``(2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1), the 
        acquisition of property within the area described in such 
        paragraph, or the management plan for such acquired property 
        shall be construed to create buffer zones outside of such 
        property. That an activity or use can be seen or heard from 
        within such acquired property shall not preclude the conduct of 
        that activity or use outside such property.''.
    (b) Limited Acquisition Authority.--Section 2(a) of that Act (16 
U.S.C. 430g-5(a)) is amended in the first sentence by inserting before 
the period the following: ``, except that the Secretary is authorized 
to acquire property within the area described in section 1(d) by 
donation only''.

            Passed the House of Representatives January 13, 2014.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,
