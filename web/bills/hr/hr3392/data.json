Requires a MEDIC to acknowledge receipt of a PDP sponsor referral of information for investigation, report back to the sponsor the investigation results within 45 days, and share them with appropriate agencies.\n\nRequires electronic transmission (e-prescribing) of prescriptions for certain covered Medicare part D controlled substances."
