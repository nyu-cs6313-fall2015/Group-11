                             TITLE I--TRADE

SEC. 101. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING EXPANDING TRADING MARKETS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live 
        outside the United States.
            (2) It is imperative to the United States economy that 
        United States businesses sell their goods and services outside 
        the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Congress should continue to work with the 
        Administration to expand trading markets; and
            (2) the future growth of the United States economy requires 
        this pro-growth strategy.

SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CHINA'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
              RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) United States copyright industries suffer severe losses 
        due to piracy in China.
            (2) Counterfeiting remains pervasive in many retail and 
        wholesale markets in China.
            (3) China also maintains market access barriers, which 
        delay entry into China for legitimate products and, thus, 
        create commercial opportunities for infringing products.
            (4) According to a report by the United States 
        International Trade Commission, Chinese piracy and 
        counterfeiting of United States software and a wide range of 
        other intellectual property cost American businesses an 
        estimated $48 billion in 2009.
            (5) The report also concluded that 2.1 million jobs could 
        be created in the United States if China complied with its 
        current international obligations to protect and enforce 
        intellectual property rights.
            (6) The most direct jobs impact would come in high-tech and 
        other innovative industries.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that China's 
intellectual property rights violations are a problem for our economy.

                          TITLE II--TAX REFORM

SEC. 201. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TAX REFORM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal tax code is long, complex, antiquated, and 
        stifling growth in our economy.
            (2) Comprehensive reform of the Federal tax code is needed 
        to get Americans working again and our economy back on track.
            (3) Independent economists estimate that, when coupled with 
        reduced Federal spending, comprehensive tax reform could lead 
        to the creation of 1 million jobs in the first year alone.
            (4) The Internal Revenue Service reports that the average 
        person spends more than 13 hours to fill out the tax forms.
            (5) A USA Today editorial lampooned the complexity by 
        noting that the instruction booklet for Apple's Ipad is one 
        page, while the instruction booklet for this year's IRS 1040 
        long form is 172 pages.
            (6) The Federal tax system needs to be reformed in order 
        for the United States to once again be competitive in the 
        international market.
            (7) The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in 
        the industrialized world.
            (8) In 1960, 17 companies headquartered in the United 
        States comprised 17 of the world's largest 20 companies--that's 
        85 percent. By 2010, just 6 companies headquartered in the 
        United States--or a mere 30 percent--were ranked among the top 
        20.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that reforming 
the Federal tax code will benefit American taxpayers and our economy.

                  TITLE III--BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT

SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING A BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that a balanced budget amendment 
would put the United States on a path to solvency and help bring 
stability to the economy.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress 
needs to pass a balanced budget amendment to the United States 
Constitution and send it to the States for ratification.

                            TITLE IV--ENERGY

SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.

necessary--
            (1) to establish and implement, in accordance with this 
        title and acting through the Director of the Bureau of Land 
        Management in consultation with the Director of the United 
        States Fish and Wildlife Service, a competitive oil and gas 
        leasing program that will result in an environmentally sound 
        program for the exploration, development, and production of the 
        oil and gas resources of the Coastal Plain; and
            (2) to administer the provisions of this title through 
        regulations, lease terms, conditions, restrictions, 
        prohibitions, stipulations, and other provisions that ensure 
        the oil and gas exploration, development, and production 
        activities on the Coastal Plain will result in no significant 
        adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their habitat, subsistence 
        resources, and the environment, including, in furtherance of 
        this goal, by requiring the application of the best 
        commercially available technology for oil and gas exploration, 
        development, and production to all exploration, development, 
        and production operations under this Act in a manner that 
        ensures the receipt of fair market value by the public for the 
        mineral resources to be leased.
    (b) Repeal.--
            (1) Repeal.--Section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest 
        Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (16 U.S.C. 3143) is repealed.
            (2) Conforming amendment.--The table of contents in section 
        1 of such Act is amended by striking the item relating to 
        section 1003.
    (c) Compliance With Requirements Under Certain Other Laws.--
            (1) Compatibility.--For purposes of the National Wildlife 
        Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 668dd et 
        seq.), the oil and gas leasing program and activities 
        authorized by this section in the Coastal Plain are deemed to 
        be compatible with the purposes for which the Arctic National 
        Wildlife Refuge was established, and no further findings or 
        decisions are required to implement this determination.
            (2) Adequacy of the department of the interior's 
        legislative environmental impact statement.--The ``Final 
        Legislative Environmental Impact Statement'' (April 1987) on 
        the Coastal Plain prepared pursuant to section 1002 of the 
        Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (16 
        U.S.C. 3142) and section 102(2)(C) of the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)) is 
        deemed to satisfy the requirements under the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 that apply with respect to 
        prelease activities, including actions authorized to be taken 
        by the Secretary to develop and promulgate the regulations for 
        the establishment of a leasing program authorized by this title 
        before the conduct of the first lease sale.
            (3) Compliance with nepa for other actions.--Before 
        conducting the first lease sale under this title, the Secretary 
        shall prepare an environmental impact statement under the 
        National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 with respect to the 
        actions authorized by this title that are not referred to in 
        paragraph (2). Notwithstanding any other law, the Secretary is 
        not required to identify nonleasing alternative courses of 
        action or to analyze the environmental effects of such courses 
        of action. The Secretary shall only identify a preferred action 
        for such leasing and a single leasing alternative, and analyze 
        the environmental effects and potential mitigation measures for 
        those two alternatives. The identification of the preferred 
        action and related analysis for the first lease sale under this 
        title shall be completed within 18 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act. The Secretary shall only consider public 
        comments that specifically address the Secretary's preferred 
        action and that are filed within 20 days after publication of 
        an environmental analysis. Notwithstanding any other law, 
        compliance with this paragraph is deemed to satisfy all 
        requirements for the analysis and consideration of the 
        environmental effects of proposed leasing under this title.
    (d) Relationship to State and Local Authority.--Nothing in this 
title shall be considered to expand or limit State and local regulatory 
authority.
    (e) Special Areas.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary, after consultation with the 
        State of Alaska, the city of Kaktovik, and the North Slope 
        Borough, may designate up to a total of 45,000 acres of the 
        Coastal Plain as a Special Area if the Secretary determines 
        that the Special Area is of such unique character and interest 
        so as to require special management and regulatory protection. 
        The Secretary shall designate as such a Special Area the 
        Sadlerochit Spring area, comprising approximately 4,000 acres.
            (2) Management.--Each such Special Area shall be managed so 
        as to protect and preserve the area's unique and diverse 
        character including its fish, wildlife, and subsistence 
        resource values.
            (3) Exclusion from leasing or surface occupancy.--The 
        Secretary may exclude any Special Area from leasing. If the 
        Secretary leases a Special Area, or any part thereof, for 
        purposes of oil and gas exploration, development, production, 
        and related activities, there shall be no surface occupancy of 
        the lands comprising the Special Area.
            (4) Directional drilling.--Notwithstanding the other 
        provisions of this subsection, the Secretary may lease all or a 
        portion of a Special Area under terms that permit the use of 
        horizontal drilling technology from sites on leases located 
        outside the Special Area.
    (f) Limitation on Closed Areas.--The Secretary's sole authority to 
close lands within the Coastal Plain to oil and gas leasing and to 
exploration, development, and production is that set forth in this 
title.
    (g) Regulations.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall prescribe such 
        regulations as may be necessary to carry out this title, 
        including rules and regulations relating to protection of the 
        fish and wildlife, their habitat, subsistence resources, and 
        environment of the Coastal Plain, by no later than 15 months 
        after the date of enactment of this Act.
            (2) Revision of regulations.--The Secretary shall 
        periodically review and, if appropriate, revise the rules and

                  TITLE V--NORTHERN ROUTE APPROVAL ACT

SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Route Approval Act''.

SEC. 502. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) To maintain our Nation's competitive edge and ensure an 
        economy built to last, the United States must have fast, 
        reliable, resilient, and environmentally sound means of moving 
        energy. In a global economy, we will compete for the world's 
        investments based in significant part on the quality of our 
        infrastructure. Investing in the Nation's infrastructure 
        provides immediate and long-term economic benefits for local 
        communities and the Nation as a whole.
            (2) The delivery of oil from Canada, a close ally not only 
        in proximity but in shared values and ideals, to domestic 
        markets is in the national interest because of the need to 
        lessen dependence upon insecure foreign sources.
            (3) The Keystone XL pipeline would provide both short-term 
        and long-term employment opportunities and related labor income 
        benefits, such as government revenues associated with taxes.
            (4) The State of Nebraska has thoroughly reviewed and 
        approved the proposed Keystone XL pipeline reroute, concluding 
        that the concerns of Nebraskans have had a major influence on 
        the pipeline reroute and that the reroute will have minimal 
        environmental impacts.
            (5) The Department of State and other Federal agencies have 
        over a long period of time conducted extensive studies and 
        analysis of the technical aspects and of the environmental, 
        social, and economic impacts of the proposed Keystone XL 
        pipeline, and--
                    (A) the Department of State assessments found that 
                the Keystone XL pipeline ``is not likely to impact the 
                amount of crude oil produced from the oil sands'' and 
                that ``approval or denial of the proposed project is 
                unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of 
                development in the oil sands'';
                    (B) the Department of State found that incremental 
                life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with the 
                Keystone XL project are estimated in the range of 0.07 
                to 0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
                equivalents, with the upper end of this range 
                representing twelve one-thousandths of one percent of 
                the 6,702 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted 
                in the United States in 2011; and
                    (C) after extensive evaluation of potential impacts 
                to land and water resources along the Keystone XL 
                pipeline's 875-mile proposed route, the Department of 
                State found that ``The analyses of potential impacts 
                associated with construction and normal operation of 
                the proposed Project suggest that there would be no 
                significant impacts to most resources along the 
                proposed Project route (assuming Keystone complies with 
                all laws and required conditions and measures).''.
            (6) The transportation of oil via pipeline is the safest 
        and most economically and environmentally effective means of 
        doing so, and--
                    (A) transportation of oil via pipeline has a record 
                of unmatched safety and environmental protection, and 
                the Department of State found that ``Spills associated 
                with the proposed Project that enter the environment 
                expected to be rare and relatively small'', and that 
                ``there is no evidence of increased corrosion or other 
                pipeline threat due to viscosity'' of diluted bitumen 
                oil that will be transported by the Keystone XL 
                pipeline; and
                    (B) plans to incorporate 57 project-specific 
                special conditions related to the design, construction, 
                and operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led the 
                Department of State to find that the pipeline will have 
                ``a degree of safety over any other typically 
                constructed domestic oil pipeline''.
            (7) The Keystone XL is in much the same position today as 
        the Alaska Pipeline in 1973 prior to congressional action. Once 
        again, the Federal regulatory process remains an insurmountable 
        obstacle to a project that is likely to reduce oil imports from 
        insecure foreign sources.

SEC. 503. KEYSTONE XL PERMIT APPROVAL.

    Notwithstanding Executive Order No. 13337 (3 U.S.C. 301 note),

Quality in January 2013 and approved by the Nebraska governor. The 
final environmental impact statement issued by the Secretary of State 
on August 26, 2011, coupled with the Final Evaluation Report described 
in the previous sentence, shall be considered to satisfy all 
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42

meet the demand for oil.

SEC. 505. AMERICAN BURYING BEETLE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) environmental reviews performed for the Keystone XL 
        pipeline project satisfy the requirements of section 7 of the 
        Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2)) in its 
        entirety; and
            (2) for purposes of that Act, the Keystone XL pipeline 
        project will not jeopardize the continued existence of the 
        American burying beetle or destroy or adversely modify American 
        burying beetle critical habitat.
    (b) Biological Opinion.--The Secretary of the Interior is deemed to 
have issued a written statement setting forth the Secretary's opinion

                TITLE VII--SECRET BALLOT PROTECTION ACT

SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Secret Ballot Protection Act''.

SEC. 702. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the importance of a secret ballot election has been 
        recognized by the United States for over 100 years;
            (2) the fundamental democratic right to choose by secret 
        ballot is the only method that ensures a choice free of 
        coercion, intimidation, irregularity, or illegality;
            (3) the recognition of a labor organization by way of a 
        private agreement, rather than a secret ballot election 
        supervised by a neutral third party, threatens an employee's 
        right, codified in the National Labor Relations Act, to choose 
        whether or not to be represented by a labor organization; and
            (4) preserving workers' right to choose whether or not to 
        be represented by a labor organization through a secret ballot 
        election is important to the strength of the national economy.

SEC. 703. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT.

    (a) Recognition of Representative.--
            (1) In general.--Section 8(a)(2) of the National Labor

        collectively with a labor organization that has not been 
        selected by a majority of employees in a unit appropriate for 
        such purposes in a secret ballot election conducted by the 
        National Labor Relations Board in accordance with section 9''.
            (2) Application.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall 
        not apply to collective bargaining relationships that were 
        recognized before the date of enactment of this Act.
    (b) Election Required.--
            (1) In general.--Section 8(b) of the National Labor

        of this section, is amended--
                    (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph 
                (6);

                (7) and inserting ``; and''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) to cause or attempt to cause an employer to recognize 
        or bargain collectively with a representative of a labor 
        organization that has not been selected by a majority of 
        employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes in a secret 
        ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board 
        in accordance with section 9.''.

        not apply to collective bargaining relationships that were 
        recognized before the date of enactment of this Act.
    (c) Secret Ballot Election Required.--Section 9(a) of the National 
Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 159(a)), is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(a)'';
            (2) by inserting after ``designated or selected'' the 
        following: ``by a secret ballot election conducted by the 
        National Labor Relations Board in accordance with this 
        section''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(2) The secret ballot election requirement of paragraph 
        (1) shall not apply to collective bargaining relationships that 
        were recognized before the date of enactment of the Secret 
        Ballot Protection Act.''.
    (d) Conforming Amendments.--Section 9(c)(1) of such Act (29 U.S.C.

                inserting ``by a representative''; and
                    (B) in clause (ii), by striking ``section 9(a);'' 
                and inserting ``subsection (a),''; and
            (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``alleging'' and all 
        that follows through ``defined in section 9(a)''.

SEC. 704. REGULATIONS.

    Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act 
the National Labor Relations Board shall review and revise all 
regulations promulgated before such date to implement the amendments 
made in this title to the National Labor Relations Act.

       TITLE VIII--FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE IMPROVEMENTS

            (1) by amending the first sentence to read as follows: ``If 
        a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of 
        this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, 
        shall impose upon the attorney, law firm, or parties that have 
        violated this subdivision or are responsible for the violation, 
        an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay the 
        other party or parties for the reasonable expenses incurred as 
        a direct result of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other 
        paper, that is the subject of the violation, including a 
        reasonable attorney's fee.'';
            (2) in paragraph (1)(A)--
                    (A) by striking ``Rule 5'' and all that follows 
                through ``corrected.'' and inserting ``Rule 5.''; and
                    (B) by striking ``the court may award'' and 
                inserting ``the court shall award''; and
            (3) in paragraph (2), by striking ``shall be limited to 
        what is sufficient'' and all that follows through the end of 
        the paragraph (including subparagraphs (A) and (B)) and 
        inserting ``shall be sufficient to deter repetition of such 
        conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated, and 
        to compensate the parties that were injured by such conduct. 
        The sanction may consist of an order to pay to the party or 
        parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred as a 
        direct result of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other 
        paper that is the subject of the violation, including a 
        reasonable attorney's fee.''.

SEC. 802. APPLICABILITY OF RULE 11 TO STATE CASES AFFECTING INTERSTATE 
              COMMERCE.

    In any civil action in State court, the court, upon motion, shall 
determine within 30 days after the filing of such motion whether the 
action substantially affects interstate commerce. Such court shall make 
such determination based on an assessment of the costs to the 
interstate economy, including the loss of jobs, were the relief 
requested granted. If the court determines such action substantially 
affects interstate commerce, the provisions of Rule 11 of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply to such action.

SEC. 803. PREVENTION OF FORUM-SHOPPING.

    (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), a personal injury claim 
filed in State or Federal court may be filed only in the State and, 
within that State, in the county (or if there is no State court in the 
county, the nearest county where a court of general jurisdiction is 
located), or Federal district in which--
            (1) the person bringing the claim, including an estate in 
        the case of a decedent and a parent or guardian in the case of 
        a minor or incompetent--
                    (A) resides at the time of filing; or
                    (B) resided at the time of the alleged injury;

            (4) the defendant resides, if the defendant is an 
        individual.
    (b) Determination of Most Appropriate Forum.--If a person alleges 
that the injury or circumstances giving rise to the personal injury 
claim occurred in more than one county (or Federal district), the trial 
court shall determine which State and county (or Federal district) is 
the most appropriate forum for the claim. If the court determines that 
another forum would be the most appropriate forum for a claim, the 
court shall dismiss the claim. Any otherwise applicable statute of 
limitations shall be tolled beginning on the date the claim was filed 
and ending on the date the claim is dismissed under this subsection.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``personal injury claim''--
                    (A) means a civil action brought under State law by 
                any person to recover for a person's personal injury, 
                illness, disease, death, mental or emotional injury, 
                risk of disease, or other injury, or the costs of 
                medical monitoring or surveillance (to the extent such 
                claims are recognized under State law), including any 
                derivative action brought on behalf of any person on 
                whose injury or risk of injury the action is based by

                    (B) does not include a claim brought as a class 
                action; and
                    (C) does not include a claim against a debtor in a 
                case pending under title 11 of the United States Code 
                that is a personal injury tort or wrongful death claim 
                within the meaning of section 157(b)(5) of title 28, 
                United States Code.

shall be construed to bar or impede the assertion or development of new 
claims or remedies under Federal, State, or local civil rights law.

SEC. 805. THREE-STRIKES RULE FOR SUSPENDING ATTORNEYS WHO COMMIT 
              MULTIPLE RULE 11 VIOLATIONS.

    (a) Mandatory Suspension.--Whenever a Federal district court 
determines that an attorney has violated Rule 11 of the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure, the court shall determine the number of times that 
the attorney has violated that rule in that Federal district court 
during that attorney's career. If the court determines that the number 
is three or more, the Federal district court--
            (1) shall suspend that attorney from the practice of law in 
        that Federal district court for one year; and
            (2) may suspend that attorney from the practice of law in 
        that Federal district court for any additional period that the 
        court considers appropriate.
    (b) Appeal; Stay.--An attorney has the right to appeal a suspension 
under subsection (a). While such an appeal is pending, the suspension 
shall be stayed.
    (c) Reinstatement.--To be reinstated to the practice of law in a 
Federal district court after completion of a suspension under 
subsection (a), the attorney involved must first petition the court for 
reinstatement under such procedures and conditions as the court may 
prescribe.

SEC. 806. PRESUMPTION OF RULE 11 VIOLATION FOR REPEATEDLY RELITIGATING 
              SAME ISSUE.

    Whenever a party presents to a Federal court a pleading, written 
motion, or other paper, that includes a claim or defense that the party 
has already litigated and lost on the merits in any forum in final 
decisions not subject to appeal on three consecutive occasions, and the 
claim or defense, respectively, involves the same plaintiff and the 
same defendant on each occasion, there shall be a rebuttable 
presumption that the presentation of such paper is in violation of Rule 
11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

SEC. 807. ENHANCED SANCTIONS FOR DOCUMENT DESTRUCTION IN PENDING 
              FEDERAL COURT PROCEEDINGS.

    Whoever willfully and intentionally influences, obstructs, or

Federal court proceeding through the willful and intentional 
destruction of documents sought pursuant to the rules of such Federal 
court proceeding and highly relevant to that proceeding--
            (1) shall be punished with mandatory civil sanctions of a 
        degree commensurate with the civil sanctions available under 
        Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, in addition to 
        any other civil sanctions that otherwise apply; and

SEC. 906. PERIODIC REVIEW OF RULES.

    Section 610 of title 5, United States Code, is amended to read as 
follows:
``Sec. 610. Periodic review of rules
    ``(a) Not later than 180 days after the enactment of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Improvements Act of 2013, each agency shall publish in the 
Federal Register and place on its website a plan for the periodic 
review of rules issued by the agency which the head of the agency 
determines have a significant economic impact on a substantial number 
of small entities. Such determination shall be made without regard to 
whether the agency performed an analysis under section 604. The purpose 
of the review shall be to determine whether such rules should be 
continued without change, or should be amended or rescinded, consistent 
with the stated objectives of applicable statutes, to minimize any 
adverse significant economic impacts or maximize any beneficial 
significant economic impacts on a substantial number of small entities. 
Such plan may be amended by the agency at any time by publishing the 
revision in the Federal Register and subsequently placing the amended 
plan on the agency's website.
    ``(b) The plan shall provide for the review of all such agency 
rules existing on the date of the enactment of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Improvements Act of 2013 within 10 years of the date of 
publication of the plan in the Federal Register and for review of rules 
adopted after the date of enactment of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Improvements Act of 2013 within 10 years after the publication of the 
final rule in the Federal Register. If the head of the agency 
determines that completion of the review of existing rules is not 
feasible by the established date, the head of the agency shall so 
certify in a statement published in the Federal Register and may extend 
the review for not longer than 2 years after publication of notice of 
extension in the Federal Register. Such certification and notice shall 
be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration and the Congress.
    ``(c) Each agency shall annually submit a report regarding the 
results of its review pursuant to such plan to the Congress, the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and, in the 
case of agencies other than independent regulatory agencies (as defined 
in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code) to the 
Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of 
the Office of Management and Budget. Such report shall include the 
identification of any rule with respect to which the head of the agency 
made a determination described in paragraph (5) or (6) of subsection 
(d) and a detailed explanation of the reasons for such determination.
    ``(d) In reviewing a rule pursuant to subsections (a) through (c), 
the agency shall amend or rescind the rule to minimize any adverse 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
or disproportionate economic impact on a specific class of small 
entities, or maximize any beneficial significant economic impact of the 
rule on a substantial number of small entities to the greatest extent 
possible, consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes. 
In amending or rescinding the rule, the agency shall consider the 
following factors:
            ``(1) The continued need for the rule.
            ``(2) The nature of complaints received by the agency from 
        small entities concerning the rule.
            ``(3) Comments by the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and 
        the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
        Administration.
            ``(4) The complexity of the rule.
            ``(5) The extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates, or 
        conflicts with other Federal rules and, unless the head of the 
        agency determines it to be infeasible, State and local rules.
            ``(6) The contribution of the rule to the cumulative 
        economic impact of all Federal rules on the class of small 
        entities affected by the rule, unless the head of the agency 
        determines that such calculations cannot be made and reports 
        that determination in the annual report required under 
        subsection (c).
            ``(7) The length of time since the rule has been evaluated 
        or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or 
        other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule.
    ``(e) The agency shall publish in the Federal Register and on its 
website a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to such plan. Such 
publication shall include a brief description of the rule, the reason 
why the agency determined that it has a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities (without regard to whether it 
had prepared a final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule), and 
request comments from the public, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the 
Small Business Administration, and the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman 
concerning the enforcement of the rule.''.
