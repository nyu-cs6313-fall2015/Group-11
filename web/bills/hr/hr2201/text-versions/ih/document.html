   To authorize voluntary grazing permit retirement on Federal lands 
   managed by the Department of Agriculture or the Department of the

                               purposes.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Economic 
Vitalization Act''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.
Sec. 2. Findings.
Sec. 3. Definitions.
Sec. 4. Rural vitalization program.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The use of Federal lands by grazing permittees and 
        lessees for commercial livestock grazing is increasingly 
        difficult due to growing conflicts with other legitimate 
        multiple uses of the lands, such as environmental protection 
        and burgeoning recreational use, and with congressionally 
        mandated goals of wildlife and habitat protection and improved 
        water quality and quantity.
            (2) A combination of sustained drought, foreign 
        competition, changing domestic markets, industry restructuring, 
        and individual ranch finances has resulted in Federal grazing 
        permits and leases becoming stranded investments for many 
        permittees and lessees.
            (3) Attempts to resolve grazing conflicts with other 
        multiple uses often require extensive range developments, 
        intensive herd management, and continuous monitoring that 
        greatly increases costs to both permittees and lessees and 
        taxpayers, far out of proportion to the benefit received.
            (4) Certain grazing allotments on Federal lands have, or 
        are likely to become, unsuitable for commercial livestock 
        production as a result of the combined effect of the factors 
        referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) and other factors.
            (5) The cost of the Federal grazing program greatly exceeds 
        revenues to the Federal treasury from grazing receipts.
            (6) Many permittees and lessees have indicated their 
        willingness to end their commercial livestock grazing on 
        Federal lands in exchange for compensation to reasonably 
        compensate them for the effort and investment that they have 
        made in a grazing allotment.
            (7) Compensating permittees and lessees who relinquish 
        their grazing permit or lease would help recapitalize an ailing 
        sector of rural America by providing economic options to 
        permittees and lessees that do not presently exist by allowing 
        them to restructure their ranch operations, start new 
        businesses, or retire with security.
            (8) Paying reasonable compensation for the relinquishment 
        of a grazing permit or lease will help alleviate the need for 
        permittees and lessees to sell or subdivide their private 
        lands.

under this Act are rendered reasonably secure from trespass grazing by
