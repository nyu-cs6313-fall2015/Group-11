Sec. 701. Offset.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers is 
        having a devastating effect on public health and safety in 
        communities across the United States. According to the Centers 
        for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdose deaths now 
        surpass traffic crashes in the number of deaths caused by 
        injury in the United States. In 2011, an average of about 110 
        people in the United States died from drug overdose every day.
            (2) Law enforcement officials and treatment experts 
        throughout the country report that many prescription opioid 
        users have turned to heroin as a cheaper or more easily 
        obtained alternative to prescription drugs.
            (3) Opioid pain relievers are the most widely misused or 
        abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly referred to as 
        ``CPDs'') and are involved in most CPD-related overdose 
        incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network 
        (commonly known as ``DAWN''), the estimated number of emergency 
        department visits involving nonmedical use of prescription 
        opiates or opioids increased by 112 percent, from 84,671 to 
        179,787, between 2006 and 2010.
            (4) According to a report by the National Association of 
        State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (commonly referred to as 
        ``NASADAD''), 37 States reported an increase in admissions to 
        treatment for heroin use during the past 2 years, while 
        admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased 500 
        percent from 2000 to 2012.
            (5) Addiction is a treatable disease. Discoveries in the 
        science of addiction have led to advances in the treatment of 
        substance use disorders that help people stop abusing drugs and 
        prescription medications and resume their productive lives.
            (6) According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy 
        (commonly referred to as ``ONDCP''), approximately 22,700,000 
        people in the United States needed substance use disorder 
        treatment in 2013, but only 2,500,000 people received it.
            (7) Effective substance abuse prevention can yield major 
        economic dividends. Every dollar invested in prevention can 
        lead to savings between $2 and $20.
            (8) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, when 
        schools and communities properly implement science-validated 
        substance abuse prevention programs, alcohol, tobacco, and 
        illicit drug abuse are reduced. Such programs help teachers, 
        parents, and health care professionals shape the perceptions of 
        youths about the risks of drug abuse.
            (9) Diverting individuals with substance use disorders from 
        criminal justice systems into community-based treatment can 
        save billions of dollars and prevent sizeable numbers of 
        crimes, arrests, and re-incarcerations over the course of those 
        individuals' lives.
            (10) According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, more than 
        1,700 tons of expired, unwanted prescription medications have 
        been collected over the past 3\1/2\ years, following the 
        enactment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 
        2010 (Public Law 111-273; 124 Stat. 2858).
            (11) Research shows that combining treatment medications 
        with behavioral therapy is the best way to ensure success for 
        most patients. Treatment approaches must be tailored to address 
        the drug abuse patterns and drug-related medical, psychiatric, 
        and social problems of each individual. Different types of 
        medications may be useful at different stages of treatment to 
        help a patient stop abusing drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid 
        relapse.
            (12) Research indicates that combating the epidemic of 
        opioid abuse, including abuse of prescription painkillers and, 
        increasingly, heroin, requires a multi-pronged approach that 
        involves reducing drug diversion, expanding delivery of 
        existing treatments (including medication-assisted treatments), 
        expanding access to overdose medications and interventions, and 
        the development of new medications for pain that can augment 
        the existing treatment arsenal.
