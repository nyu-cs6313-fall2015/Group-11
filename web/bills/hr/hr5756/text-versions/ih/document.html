_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To restore a public firearms range to the District of Columbia.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Heller Public Firearms Range Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The right to keep and bear arms in the District of 
        Columbia has been severely restricted for many years, resulting 
        in citizens with firearms skills insufficient for proper 
        safety.
            (2) The ability of the public to safely use firearms for 
        hunting and self defense is dependent on sufficient 
        opportunities for safety education and training.
            (3) The Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 
        U.S.C. 669 et seq.) facilitates hunter and firearm safety 
        education and training for all States.
            (4) Richard A. Heller of Washington, DC, has shown untiring 
        energy and courage in pursuing Second Amendment rights for the 
        citizens of the District of Columbia, resulting in the landmark 
        Supreme Court decision in the case District of Columbia v. 
        Heller (554 U.S. 570, 2008).

SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE PITTMAN-ROBERTSON WILDLIFE RESTORATION ACT.

    (a) Apportionment to District of Columbia.--Section 4(c) of the 
Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669c(c)) is 
amended by inserting ``the District of Columbia,'' after ``Puerto 
Rico,''.
    (b) Cooperation and Payment of Funds.--Section 8A of such Act (16 
U.S.C. 669g-1) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 8A. COOPERATION AND PAYMENT OF FUNDS.
