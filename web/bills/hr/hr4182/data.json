Allows use of motorized vessels in a manner less restrictive than those restrictions.\n\nDenies the eligibility of any area within the Riverways for congressional wilderness designation under the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n\nDirects the Secretary to manage the Riverways in a manner that is not more restrictive than the provisions of the general management plan for it in effect on November 21, 2013.
