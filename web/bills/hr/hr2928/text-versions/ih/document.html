                                 A BILL


 
  To direct the Election Assistance Commission to develop and publish 
recommendations for best practices that States may use in establishing 
   and operating independent Congressional redistricting commissions.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair and Independent Redistricting 
(FAIR) Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Constitution requires reapportionment of seats in 
        the House of Representatives after each decennial census.
            (2) One of the greatest powers that the people have is the 
        right to elect a representative who best represents the 
        interests of the community.
            (3) States are required to redraw Congressional districts 
        after reapportionment.
            (4) Independent citizens redistricting commissions are 
        intended to develop Congressional redistricting plans that 
        reflect the best interests of the people, not the incumbent 
        political parties.
            (5) The Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which was 
        established by the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), is an 
        independent, bipartisan commission charged with developing 
        guidance and best practices for State voting systems.

SEC. 3. DEVELOPMENT OF BEST PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STATES 
              ESTABLISHING INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS.

    (a) Development.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Election Assistance Commission shall publish 
a report containing the Commission's best practice recommendations that 
States may use in establishing and operating independent commissions to 
develop Congressional redistricting plans.
    (b) Consultation.--In developing the recommendations required under 
this Act, the Election Assistance Commission shall consult with States 
that have implemented, or are considering implementing, independent 
commissions to develop Congressional redistricting plans, as well as 
individuals who have served on such commissions.
    (c) Dissemination.--
            (1) Public availability online.--The Commission shall 
        ensure that the report published under this section is 
        available to the public online.
            (2) Notification of officials.--Upon publishing the report 
        under this section, the Commission shall notify each of the 
        following that the report is available:
                    (A) Each Member of Congress, including each 
                Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the Congress.
                    (B) The chief executive officer and chief State 
                election official of each State, as well as the head of 
                each house of the legislature of each State. For 
                purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``State'' 
                includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
                Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States 
                Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern 
                Mariana Islands.
