 To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to reform the provisions 
      relating to status under section 101(a)(15)(U) of that Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ELIGIBILITY.

    Section 101(a)(15)(U) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U)) is amended--
            (1) by amending clause (ii) to read as follows:
            ``(ii) the spouse and children of an alien described in 
        clause (i), if accompanying or following to join the alien; 
        and''; and
            (2) in clause (iii), by striking ``or attempt, conspiracy, 
        or solicitation to commit any of the above mentioned crimes;''.

SEC. 2. DURATION OF STATUS.

    (a) In General.--Section 214(p)(6) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 
1184(p)(6)) is amended to read as follows:
            ``(6) Duration of status.--The authorized period of status 
        of an alien as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(U) shall 
        be not more than the shorter of 3 years or the period of 
        limitations prescribed in the applicable law governing the 
        criminal activity described in section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii). Such 
        authorized period of status shall be extended upon 
        certification from a Federal, State, or local law enforcement 
        official, prosecutor, judge, or other Federal, State, or local 
        authority investigating or prosecuting criminal activity 
        described in section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) that the alien's 
        presence in the United States is required to assist in the 
        investigation or prosecution of such criminal activity. The 
        Secretary of Homeland Security may extend, beyond the period 
        authorized under this section, the authorized period of status 
        of an alien as a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(U) if 
        the Secretary determines that an extension of such period is 
        warranted due to exceptional circumstances. The Secretary may 
        grant work authorization to any alien who has a pending, bona 
        fide application for nonimmigrant status under section 
        101(a)(15)(U).''.
    (b) Limitation on Adjustment of Status.--Section 245 of such Act (8 
U.S.C. 1255) is amended by striking subsection (m).
                                 <all>
