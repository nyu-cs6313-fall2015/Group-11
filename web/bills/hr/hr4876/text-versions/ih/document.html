SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Emerging Business Encouragement Act 
of 2014''.

SEC. 2. EMERGING BUSINESS ENTERPRISES.

    (a) Designation.--Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 
632) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(dd) Emerging Business Enterprises.--
            ``(1) In general.--Not later than the date that is 1 year 
        after the date of enactment of this paragraph, for each 
        industry category for which the Administrator established a 
        size standard under this subsection, the Administrator shall by 
        rule establish procedures for designating a small business 
        concern in that industry category as an emerging business 
        enterprise. Such procedures shall include the criteria under 
        paragraph (2), and a process for appealing decisions of the 
        Administrator on designations. Such a designation shall expire 
        on the date that the small business concern is no longer in 
        compliance with such criteria, except that--
                    ``(A) in the case of an emerging business 
                enterprise that receives a designation as such but 
                which existed as a business entity prior to such 
                designation, the designation shall not expire by reason 
                of the emerging business enterprise being more than 5 
                years old; instead, the designation shall expire on the 
                date that is 5 years after the date of the designation; 
                and
                    ``(B) if the emerging business enterprise exceeds 
                the size limitation described in the criterion under 
                paragraph (2)(A) following designation as an emerging 
                business enterprise, the designation shall expire only 
                if the size is 50 percent or more of the maximum size 
                of a small business concern within that industry 
                category.
        The rulemaking under this paragraph shall include a procedure 
        for self certification as an emerging business enterprise, for 
        annual submission of documentation establishing eligibility for 
        designation as an emerging business enterprise, and for 
        periodic audits of emerging business enterprises based on such 
        documentation.
            ``(2) Criteria for designation.--The Administrator shall 
        establish criteria for designation of an emerging business 
        enterprise, which shall include the following:
                    ``(A) Number of employees.--That the small business 
                concern employs, in the Administrator's determination a 
                number of employees that is less than the larger of--
                            ``(i) not more than 10 percent of the 
                        number of employees that a small business 
                        concern within that industry category may 
                        employ, if that small business concern is so 
                        classified by reason of a size standard under 
                        section 3(a) pertaining to the number of 
                        employees of the concern; or
                            ``(ii) 25 employees.
                    ``(B) Age of business.--That the small business 
                concern is, in the Administrator's determination, not 
                more than 5 years old.
                    ``(C) Salary requirements.--That the small business 
                concern does not, in the Administrator's determination, 
                pay to an individual who owns any part of the concern 
                or who is in a management position a salary greater 
                than 200 percent of the mean annual salary for Managers 
                of Companies and Enterprises or the equivalent from the 
                most recent Employment and Wage Estimates developed by 
                the Secretary of Labor.
            ``(3) Public notification.--The Administrator shall take 
        appropriate action to publicize the establishment of the 
        procedures for designations under this paragraph, including by 
        conducting outreach to eligible small business concerns.
            ``(4) Contractor training.--The Administrator shall provide 
        for training regarding Federal procurement on an Internet Web 
        site of the Administrator, which shall be available to the 
        public at no charge.''.
    (b) Contracting Preference.--Section 15(g)(2) of the Small Business 
Act (15 U.S.C. (g)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(G) Emerging business enterprises.--
                            ``(i) In general.--The head of each Federal 
                        agency shall, after consultation with the 
                        Administrator, establish goals for 
                        participation by emerging business enterprises 
                        designated under section 3(a)(6) in not less 
                        than 5 percent of all contracts, including 
                        prime contracts and subcontracts, for each 
                        fiscal year. The head of the agency may give 
                        preference in making contract awards to such 
                        emerging business enterprises and shall make 
                        consistent efforts to annually expand 
                        participation by emerging business enterprises 
                        from each industry category in procurement
