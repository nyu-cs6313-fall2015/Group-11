Defines \"hardship\" to include situations in which a small business has missed two or more consecutive\u00a0loan payments, is a debtor in a Chapter 11 (reorganization) bankruptcy proceeding,\u00a0has received a notice of termination of utility services or a notice of eviction, has experienced a fire, flood, or other disaster, or has\u00a0experienced another hardships as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Directs the Secretary to conduct a study to identify additional hardships appropriate for granting an hardship exemption.\n\nProhibits the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from\u00a0taking into account\u00a0the applicability of a hardship exemption to a small business\u00a0as the sole factor in determining whether to audit such business."
