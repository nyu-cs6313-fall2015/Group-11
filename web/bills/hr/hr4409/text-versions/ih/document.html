                                 A BILL


 
  To award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to 
James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner to commemorate the 
lives they lost 50 years ago in an effort to bring justice and equality 
           to Americans in Mississippi during Freedom Summer.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) June 21, 2014, will mark 50 years since the lives of 
        James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were 
        brutally taken on the basis of racism and hatred.
            (2) Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were assisting Congress 
        of Racial Equality in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer of 
        1964, wherein they risked their lives leading voting 
        registration efforts for people who were denied the right to 
        vote.
            (3) Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner were imprisoned in 
        Neshoba County, Mississippi, without due process and released 
        into the dead of the night into the hands of Klansmen.
            (4) The disappearance of these devoted civil rights 
        activists captured national attention and led to an 
        investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
            (5) Following a 44-day search by Federal agents, the grim 
        remains of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner 
        were discovered in an earthen dam.
            (6) This tragedy galvanized momentum for the Civil Rights 
        Movement and helped to secure the passage of the Civil Rights 
        Act of 1964 and later the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and led to 
        the first permanent Federal Bureau of Investigation field 
        office in the State of Mississippi.
            (7) Justice was delayed 41 years, to the day, for these 
        three brave men and their families until a Neshoba County grand 
        jury found 1 of the 18 men originally charged in the case 
        guilty on three counts of murder.
            (8) These three valiant activists are representative of 
        countless individuals who lost their lives on a quest for 
        justice and equality, including Henry Hezekiah Dee and Charles 
        Eddie More whose bodies were also found during the massive 
        search for Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner.
            (9) Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner's legacy of advocacy and 
        unyielding resolve for justice in the face of peril is one that 
        continues to be embodied in young adults across this great 
        country.
            (10) It is befitting that Congress bestow the highest 
        civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, in 2014 to James 
        Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner, posthumously in 
        recognition of the 50th commemoration of their kidnapping and 
        subsequent murders.
