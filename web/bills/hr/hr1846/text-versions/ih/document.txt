  To amend the Act establishing the Lower East Side Tenement National 
                 Historic Site, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lower East Side Tenement National 
Historic Site Amendments Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Lower East Side Tenement Museum was founded in 1988 
        and has, for the past 25 years, preserved and interpreted the 
        history of immigration through the personal experiences of 
        generations of newcomers who settled in and built lives on 
        Manhattan's Lower East Side, America's iconic immigrant 
        neighborhood.
            (2)(A) The Director of the National Park Service found the 
        Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street to be nationally 
        significant.
            (B) On April 19, 1994, the Secretary of the Interior 
        declared the Lower East Side Tenement a National Historic 
        Landmark.
            (C) The Director of the National Park Service, through a 
        special resource study, found the Lower East Side Tenement 
        suitable and feasible for inclusion in the National Park 
        System.
            (D) On November 12, 1998, the historic site was designated 
        as an affiliated site of the National Park System pursuant to 
        Public Law 105-378.
            (3)(A) In 2006, the Secretary of the Interior, together 
        with the National Park Service, compiled a general management 
        plan for the site.
            (B) The plan recognized the need for space for 
        administrative functions, collections storage, and visitor 
        services, including orientation and additional exhibits.
            (C) The plan expressly specified that a boundary adjustment 
        to the National Historic Site might be considered if the museum 
        was able to obtain property and the resources--
                    (i) included significant features related of the 
                primary purposes of the site;
                    (ii) addressed operational issues including access; 
                or
                    (iii) protected resources critical to the site's 
                purposes.
            (4) The Museum obtained a neighboring 1888 tenement, 103 
        Orchard Street, which was restored and renovated to serve as a 
        visitor and education center.
            (5) 103 Orchard Street was declared a contributing property 
        in the Lower East Side National Historic District, listed on 
        both the National and New York State Registers of Historic 
        Places.
