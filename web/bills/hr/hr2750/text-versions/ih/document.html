        approves the contracting officer's justification that an 
        individual solicitation must have greater than 5 finalists to 
        be in the Federal Government's interest. The contracting 
        officer must provide written documentation of how a maximum 
        number of offerors exceeding 5 is consistent with the purposes 
        and objectives of the two-phase selection process.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(f) Design and Construction Contracts.--Two-phase selection 
procedures shall be used for entering into a contract for the design 
and construction of a public building, facility, or work when a 
contracting officer determines that the contract has a value of 
$750,000 or greater, as adjusted for inflation in accordance with 
section 1908 of title 41, United States Code.
    ``(g) Reports.--
            ``(1) Agency reports.--Beginning on the date that is 1 year 
        after the effective date of this subsection, and for each of 
        the 4 years thereafter, each agency shall submit to the 
        Comptroller General of the United States and publish in the 
        Federal Register, an annual report regarding all cases in the 
        preceding year in which--
                    ``(A) more than 5 finalists were selected for 
                phase-two requests for competitive proposals; or
                    ``(B) for a contract that has a value of $750,000 
                (as adjusted for inflation in accordance with section 
                1908 of title 41, United States Code) or greater for 
                which the two-phase selection procedures was not used.
            ``(2) GAO report.--On the first full fiscal year that is 5 
        years after the effective date of this subsection, the 
        Comptroller General of the United States shall publish a report 
        that, based on the information provided in the agency reports 
        required under paragraph (1), analyzes the degree to which 
        agencies have complied with the requirements of this 
        section.''.
