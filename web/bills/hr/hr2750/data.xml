  <summary>7/19/2013--Introduced.
Design-Build Efficiency and Jobs Act of 2013 - Modifies the procedure for awarding design and construction contracts for federal buildings and facilities to require: (1) a contracting officer to provide a written justification to the head of an agency for requiring more than five finalists in the bidding process for such contracts and agency approval of such justification; and (2) the use of the two-phase selection process (i.e., submission of qualifications and then the submission of price and technical proposals in response to a request for proposal) for contracts having a value of $750,000 or greater.

Requires each agency that awards design and construction contracts to submit to the Comptroller General (GAO) and publish in the Federal Register an annual report on: (1) all contracts for which more than five finalists were selected for phase-two requests for competitive proposals, and (2) contracts having a value of $750,000 or greater for which the two-phase selection process was not used.

Requires the Comptroller General to publish a report that analyzes the compliance of federal agencies with the requirements of this Act.</summary>
