           TITLE I--AUTHORIZATION OF INCOME SHARE AGREEMENTS

SEC. 101. PURPOSE; LAWFULNESS OF INSTRUMENTS; PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW.

    (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title to authorize 
individuals to enter into income share agreements for the purposes of 
obtaining funds in exchange for agreeing to pay to the holder of the 
contract a specified percentage of the individual's future income.
    (b) Lawfulness of Contracts; Preemption.--Any income share 
agreement that complies with the requirements of section 102 shall be a 
valid, binding, and enforceable contract notwithstanding any State law 
limiting or otherwise regulating assignments of future wages or other 
income.

SEC. 102. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF INCOME SHARE AGREEMENT CONTRACTS.

    (a) Definition of Income Share Agreement.--For purposes of this 
title, the term ``income share agreement'' means an agreement between 
an individual and any other person under which the individual commits 
to pay a specified percentage of the individual's future income, for a 
specified period of time, in exchange for payments to or on behalf of 
such individual for postsecondary education, workforce development, or 
other purposes.
    (b) Terms and Conditions of Agreements.--An income share agreement 
complies with the requirements of this section if the contract complies 
with each of the following conditions:
            (1) Specified percentage of income.--An income share 
        agreement shall specify the percentage of future income which 
        the individual will be obligated to pay, except that the 
        contract shall exempt, at a minimum, the first $10,000 
        (adjusted each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price 
        Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor 
        Statistics of the Department of Labor for the most recent 12-
        month period for which such data are available) of an 
        individual's income when determining the individual's 
        obligation for a given year.
            (2) Definition of income.--An income share agreement shall 
        specify the definition of income to be used for purposes of 
        calculating an individual's obligation under the contract.
            (3) Aggregate limitation on obligation.--No eligible 
        individual may enter into any income share agreement if the 
        total percentage of such individual's future income that the 
        individual agrees to pay under that contract, and any other 
        income share agreements of such individual, exceeds 15 percent 
        of such future income.
            (4) Specified duration; extension of period.--An income 
        share agreement shall specify the maximum period of time during 
        which the individual will be obligated to pay a portion of the 
        individual's future income, except that--
                    (A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), such 
                period may not exceed 360 months; and
                    (B) such contract may provide that such period may 
                be extended by the number of years during which the 
                individual's income is below the exemption amount 
                specified in the agreement under paragraph (1).
            (5) Early termination.--An income share agreement shall 
        specify the terms and conditions by which the individual may 
        extinguish the individual's obligations under the contract 
        before the end of the payment period specified in the 
        agreement, based on the remaining term of such period.
    (c) Required Disclosures.--An income share agreement does not 
comply with the requirements of this section unless the individual who 
is committing to pay future income is provided, before entry into such 
agreement, a disclosure document that clearly and simply discloses 
that--
            (1) the agreement is not a debt instrument, and that the 
        amount the individual will be required to pay under the 
        agreement--
                    (A) may be more or less than the amount provided to 
                the individual; and
                    (B) will vary in proportion to the individual's 
                future income;
            (2) the obligations of the individual under the agreement 
        are not dischargeable under bankruptcy law;
            (3) whether the obligations of the individual under the 
        agreement may be extinguished by accelerating payments, and, if 
        so, under what terms;
            (4) the duration of the individual's obligations under the 
        agreement (absent such accelerating payments), including any 
        circumstances under which the contract would be extended;
            (5) the percentage of income the individual is committing 
        to pay and the amount of income that is exempt from the 
        calculation of the individual's obligation; and
            (6) the definition of income to be used for purposes of 
        calculating the individual's obligation.
    (d) Non-Interference.--An income share agreement shall not be 
construed to give the contract holder any rights over an individual's 
actions--it simply represents an obligation by the individual pay the 
specific percentage of future income.
