                    (C) by redesignating clause (iii) as clause (ii);

                to''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(C) Criteria for determination of exceptional 
                event demonstration.--
                            ``(i) In general.--The criteria for 
                        evidence, analyses, and documentation 
                        applicable to approval or disapproval of an 
                        exceptional event demonstration under the 
                        regulations under this section shall be stated 
                        with specificity in order to minimize the 
                        discretion of the Administrator in approving or 
                        disapproving that demonstration.
                            ``(ii) State participation.--The 
                        Administrator shall develop the criteria in 
                        conjunction with input from the States.
                            ``(iii) Contents.--The criteria shall 
                        reflect the varying levels of technical 
                        expertise and resources available in State and 
                        local agencies and the varying availability of 
                        meteorological and other monitoring data in 
                        rural areas, and may vary with respect to 
                        different regions.
                            ``(iv) Considerations.--In developing the 
                        criteria, the Administrator shall consider the 
                        use of an expedited or streamlined approval 
                        process and conditions under which exceptional 
                        event demonstrations may be suitable for such a 
                        process.
