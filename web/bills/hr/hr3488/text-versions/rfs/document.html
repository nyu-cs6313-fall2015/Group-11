    (d) Remediation Plan.--
            (1) In general.--The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and 
        Border Protection shall monthly measure the average customs 
        processing time to enter the 25 United States airports that 
        support the highest volume of international travel (as 
        determined by available Federal passenger data) and provide to 
        the appropriate congressional committees such measurements.
            (2) Assessment.--Based on the measurements described in 
        paragraph (1), the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection shall quarterly assess whether the average customs 
        processing time referred to in such paragraph significantly 
        exceeds the average customs processing time to enter the United 
        States through a prclearance operation.
            (3) Submission.--Based on the assessment conducted under 
        paragraph (2), if the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection determines that the average customs processing time 
        referred to in paragraph (1) significantly exceeds the average 
        customs processing time to enter the United States through a 
        preclearance operation described in paragraph (2), the 
        Commissioner shall, not later than 60 days after making such 
        determination, provide to the appropriate congressional 
        committees a remediation plan for reducing such average customs 
        processing time referred to in paragraph (1).
            (4) Implementation.--Not later than 30 days after 
        submitting the remediation plan referred to in paragraph (3), 
        the Commissioner of United States Customs and Border Protection 
        shall implement those portions of such plan that can be carried 
        out using existing resources, excluding the transfer of 
        personnel.
            (5) Suspension.--If the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and 
        Border Protection does not submit the remediation plan referred 
        to in paragraph (3) within 60 days in accordance with such 
        paragraph, the Commissioner may not, until such time as such 
        remediation plan is submitted, conduct any negotiations 
        relating to preclearance operations at an airport in any 
        country or commence any such preclearance operations.
            (6) Stakeholder recommendations.--The remediation plan 
        described in paragraph (3) shall consider recommendations 
        solicited from relevant stakeholders.

Security determines that such is appropriate.

SEC. 5. AVIATION SECURITY SCREENING AT PRECLEARANCE AIRPORTS.

    (a) Aviation Security Standards Agreement.--Prior to the 
commencement of preclearance operations at an airport in a foreign 
country under this Act, the Administrator of the Transportation 
Security Administration shall enter into an agreement with the 
government of such foreign country that delineates and requires the 
adoption of aviation security screening standards that are determined 
by the Administrator to be comparable to those of the United States.
    (b) Aviation Security Rescreening.--If the Administrator of the 
Transportation Security Administration determines that the government 
of a foreign country has not maintained security standards and 
protocols comparable to those of the United States at airports at which 
preclearance operations have been established in accordance with an 
agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (a), the Administrator 
shall require the rescreening in the United States by the 
Transportation Security Administration of passengers and their property 
before such passengers may deplane into sterile areas of airports in 
the United States.
    (c) Selectees.--Any passenger who is determined to be a selectee 
based on a check against a terrorist watch list and arrives on a flight 
originating from a foreign airport at which preclearance operations

pursuant to subsection (a), shall be required to undergo security 
rescreening by the Transportation Security Administration before being 
permitted to board a domestic flight in the United States.

    The Secretary of Homeland Security may not enter into or renew an 
agreement with the government of a foreign country to establish or

        stolen passports of its citizens and nationals to INTERPOL's 
        Stolen and Lost Travel Document database; or
            (2) makes available to the United States Government such 
        information through another comparable means of reporting.
