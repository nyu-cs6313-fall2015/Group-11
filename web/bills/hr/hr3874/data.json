Requires the abolishment of any agency within one year of the Commission's review, unless the agency is reauthorized by Congress. Authorizes the deadline for abolishing an agency to be extended for an additional two years by legislation enacted by a super majority of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nTerminates the Commission on December 31, 2033.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General\u00a0(GAO) and the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in cooperation with the Director of the Congressional Research Service (CRS), to prepare an inventory of federal programs within each agency, including the budget authority for each such program,\u00a0to assist Congress and the Commission in carrying out the requirements of this Act."
