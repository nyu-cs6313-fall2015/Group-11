  To amend the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 to suspend the 
  salary of Members of Congress and deem Members of Congress as ``non-
          essential'' employees during a government shutdown.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF PAY FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

    Section 601(a)(2) of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 
U.S.C. 31) is amended by amending the section to read as follows:
    ``(C) Effective with the termination of a fiscal year at the end of 
which the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate fail to 
reach agreement on government spending, Members of Congress may not 
receive pay until a government spending agreement by the U.S. House of 
Representatives and U.S. Senate on future spending is agreed to.''.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF ESSENTIAL AND NON-ESSENTIAL FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.

    Consistent with the Constitution and the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31

        of Congress would be deemed ``non-essential''.

SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    The amendments made by this Act shall apply with respect to any 
adjustment which, but for this Act, would otherwise become effective in 
the event of a lapse in appropriations for government spending where 
the government would thereby shut down.
                                 <all>
