Limits fellowship support during such a master's degree program to one year, with a prorated amount in the case of enrollment in a part-time program.\n\nIncludes elementary or secondary school computer science teachers as mathematics and science teachers for purposes of the program of teacher recruiting and training grants known as the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program."
