                                 A BILL


 
To reform and modernize domestic refugee resettlement programs, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Refugee Resettlement Reform 
and Modernization Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has enhanced and accelerated its 
        efforts to resettle Iraqi refugees since 2007.
            (2) Resettlement in the United States remains an important 
        option for refugees around the world that lack any other 
        durable solution.
            (3) Many of these refugees are victims of torture and 
        persecution, or were forced to flee because of support they 
        gave to American military, Government, or media operations.
            (4) Refugees are often a product of human rights atrocities 
        and war, making them likely to have suffered traumatic events 
        which require the United States to offer them protection and 
        meet their needs once they arrive here.
            (5) In fiscal year year 2012, a total of 58,238 refugees 
        were resettled in the United States, including 12,163 from 
        Iraq.
            (6) Upon arrival in the United States, there is authorized 
        up to 36 months of cash and medical assistance available to 
        refugees, as well as access to social services, such as job 
        placement, from the Office of Refugee Resettlement, but in 
        practice refugees receive only 8 months of cash and medical 
        assistance.
            (7) When given adequate support through the resettlement 
        system, refugees can successfully become self-sufficient and 
        contribute positively to their communities.
            (8) Additional resources and better data could strengthen 
        refugee services and better respond to the need of highly 
        vulnerable refugees.
            (9) ORR funding formulas are retroactive in nature, using 
        refugee admission data from up to 3 prior years, so that large 
        increases in refugee admissions are not adequately reflected in 
        the amount of resources provided by ORR.
            (10) The United States resettlement policy assumes refugees 
        will be able to quickly become self-sufficient, while 
        specifically offering resettlement to individuals who have 
        specific vulnerabilities that inhibit their ability to achieve 
        self-sufficiency and integrate into society.
            (11) Some refugees will have mental health difficulties 
        associated with trauma or torture and this is one of the 
        significant barriers to self-sufficiency and integration into a 
        community when it is not addressed with adequate and 
        appropriate services.
            (12) Secondary migration is not properly tracked, and 
        resources are not available for States and agencies 
        experiencing high levels of secondary migration.
            (13) Refugee services are provided by national resettlement 
        agencies, community based organizations, charities, and 
        nonprofits and coordinated locally by State refugee programs, 
        and all the organizations should be supported in their mission 
        to provide refugee services.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    This Act shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act.

    (a) In General.--As soon as practicable after the date of the

        refugee needs in the United States.
            (2) The effectiveness of the Office of Refugee Resettlement 
        programs in helping refugees to meet self-sufficiency and 
        integration.
            (3) An evaluation of the Office of Refugee Resettlement's 
        budgetary resources and projection of the amount of additional 
        resources needed to fully address the unmet needs of refugees 
        with regard to self-sufficiency and integration.
            (4) The role of community based organizations in serving 
        refugees in areas experiencing a high number of new refugee 
        arrivals.
            (5) An analysis of how community based organizations can be 
        better utilized and supported in the Federal domestic 
        resettlement process.
            (6) Recommendations on statutory changes to improve the 
        Office of Refugee Resettlement and the domestic refugee program 
        in relation to the matters analyzed under paragraphs (1) 
        through (5).
    (c) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment
