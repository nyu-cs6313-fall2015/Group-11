Amends the Public Health Service Act to require the Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to determine when it is appropriate for projects of basic research involving cells, tissues, or animals to include both male and female cells, tissues, or animals. Requires, in such cases, disaggregation of results according to sex. Provides guidelines for ensuring that sex differences are examined and analyzed.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support the continued operation and expansion of Special Centers of Research on Sex Differences.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General (GAO) to provide to Congress updated versions of the reports entitled \u201cWomen's Health: NIH Has Increased Its Efforts To Include Women in Research\u201d and \u201cWomen's Health: Women Sufficiently Represented in New Drug Testing, But FDA Oversight Needs Improvement,\u201d including in the reports examination of:\n\n the inclusion of women, female animals, and female-derived cells and tissues in federally funded research over the past decade; federal reporting and analysis of subgroup information and the translation of differences to the medical community and patients; the effect of inclusion rates in research on the quality of women\u2019s health care; and current efforts within government agencies to encourage the sharing of research data on sex differences and mechanisms to improve such sharing."
