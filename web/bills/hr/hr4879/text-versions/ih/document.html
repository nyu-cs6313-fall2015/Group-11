appropriate, to ensure that the design and size of clinical trials for 
products granted expedited approval pursuant to section 506 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356) are sufficient to 
determine the safety and effectiveness of such products for men and 
women using subgroup analysis.

                        threatening disease or condition;
                    ``(B) whether alone or in combination with one or 
                more other drugs or biological products, is intended 
                for safer or more effective treatment for men or women 
                than a currently available product approved to treat 
                the general population or the other sex; and
                    ``(C) is supported by results of clinical trials

                sharing, including a publicly accessible online system 
                that will conform with policies protecting commercial, 
                proprietary, or private information.
