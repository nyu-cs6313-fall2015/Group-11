  To amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to improve 
            attorney accountability, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of

SEC. 2. ATTORNEY ACCOUNTABILITY.

    (a) Sanctions Under Rule 11.--Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``may'' and inserting 
        ``shall'';
            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``Rule 5'' and all that 
        follows through ``motion.'' and inserting ``Rule 5.''; and
            (3) in paragraph (4), by striking ``situated'' and all that 
        follows through the end of the paragraph and inserting 
        ``situated, and to compensate the parties that were injured by 
        such conduct. Subject to the limitations in paragraph (5), the 
        sanction shall consist of an order to pay to the party or 
        parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred as a 
        direct result of the violation, including reasonable attorneys' 
        fees and costs. The court may also impose additional 
        appropriate sanctions, such as striking the pleadings, 
        dismissing the suit, or other directives of a nonmonetary 
        nature, or, if warranted for effective deterrence, an order 
        directing payment of a penalty into the court.''.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or an amendment made 
by this Act shall be construed to bar or impede the assertion or 
development of new claims, defenses, or remedies under Federal, State, 
or local laws, including civil rights laws, or under the Constitution 
of the United States.

            Passed the House of Representatives November 14, 2013.

            Attest:
