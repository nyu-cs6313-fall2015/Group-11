promulgate standards for the uniform testing of projectiles against the 
Body Armor Exemplar.
    ``(2) The standards promulgated under paragraph (1) shall take into

handgun, the amount and kind of powder used to propel the projectile, 
and the design of the projectile.
    ``(3) In paragraph (1), the term `Body Armor Exemplar' means body

        appropriate.
