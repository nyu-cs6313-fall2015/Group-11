SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIVATE EDUCATIONAL LENDERS.

    (a) In General.--Section 140 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 
1650) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(g) Death or Bankruptcy of a Cosigner on a Private Education 
Loan.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any provision in a 
        private education loan agreement, a private educational lender 
        shall immediately notify a borrower if, upon receiving 
        notification of the death or bankruptcy of a cosigner who is 
        jointly liable for the private education loan, such lender 
        deems the borrower to be in default, changes the terms of the 
        loan, or accelerates the repayment terms of the loan.
            ``(2) New cosigner.--A private educational lender shall 
        provide a period of time of not less than 90 days, beginning on 
        the date such lender issues the notification described in 
        subsection (a), for a borrower to identify a new cosigner for 
        the loan. Such lender shall retain the right to renegotiate 
        loan terms based on the creditworthiness of the new 
        cosigner.''.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--The amendments made by this Act shall 
apply to any private education loan agreements in existence on the date 
of enactment of this Act or entered into after the date of enactment of 
this Act.
