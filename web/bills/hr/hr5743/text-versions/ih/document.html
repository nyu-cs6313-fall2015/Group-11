                                 A BILL


 
 To establish a commission to identify and examine issues of national 
 concern related to the conduct of intercollegiate athletics, to make 
    recommendations for the resolution of the issues, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) properly conducted intercollegiate athletic programs 
        contribute to the beneficial development of student athletes 
        and the vibrancy of campus life at institutions of higher 
        education;
            (2) recent events pose grave threats to the financial 
        stability of athletic programs at institutions of higher 
        education and create pressure on institutions of higher 
        education to consider eliminating non-revenue Olympic sports or 
        increasing general fund, student fee, and donor subsidies to 
        athletics at a time when such resources are needed for priority 
        academic programs;
            (3) there are concerns about the health and safety needs of 
        student athletes with regard to adequacy of injury protections 
        and other medical protocols;
            (4) academic integrity at institutions of higher education 
        is threatened by increased incidences of academic fraud 
        involving student athletes, failure to provide adequate 
        remedial programs for academically unprepared admitted 
        athletes, and excessive athletics time demands;
            (5) student athletes faced with loss of financial aid and 
        other benefits and National Collegiate Athletic Association 
        (NCAA) member institutions in danger of financial penalties, 
        loss of media rights, and public embarrassment due to alleged 
        rules violations are not being afforded adequate due process;
            (6) the NCAA, member institutions of the NCAA, and college 
        presidents have not adequately addressed these issues; and
            (7) reform is so complex and important to higher education 
        that a blue ribbon commission of sport experts and members of 
        Congress should be convened to objectively study these issues 
        and propose solutions.

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT.

    There is established a commission to be known as the Presidential 
Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics.
