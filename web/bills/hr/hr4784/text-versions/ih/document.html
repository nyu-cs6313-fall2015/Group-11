systems under section 2(a)(1)--
            (1) to ensure determinations described in paragraphs (2) 
        and (3) of section 2(a) of dangerousness and determinations 
        described in section 2(a)(4) of serious threat for purposes of 
        reporting information under section 2(a)(1) are administered

            (2) to ensure that only individuals qualified to make such 
        determinations are permitted to do so;
            (3) to ensure an individual has recourse at any point 
        during the detention of such individual at a mental health 
        institution on the basis of a voluntary or involuntary 
        commitment to contest the legality of such commitment or 
        determination of dangerousness by means of a ``habeas corpus'' 
        or writ hearing;
            (4) to ensure all reporting to law enforcement officials, 
        State-based databases, and National Instant Criminal Background 
        Check System are compliant with applicable Federal and State 
        privacy and security protections and standards;
            (5) to recommend the process by which qualified 
        professionals should assess an individual to determine

                the probable effects and possible side effects of the 
                medication.

                        behavior that is the reason the medication is 
                        being given or recommended.
                            (ii) The likelihood of such mental illness

            (5) Assessment.--Guidelines related to the process of 
        assessing an individual for a temporary involuntary commitment

                shall assess the individual with a face to face 
                assessment to determine the appropriateness of the 
                temporary involuntary detention or hold.

                second mental health professional shall independently

                professional containing critical information as 
                determined by the Secretary must be given to the 
                individual.
            (7) Additional guidelines.--Any other guidelines deemed 
        necessary by the Secretary for purposes of this Act.

provisions of this Act, and section 922 of title 18, United States 
Code, individuals who are temporarily involuntarily committed or held 
under a State-level process with respect to which the State has been 
certified under section 4(c) shall be treated as a separate and 
distinct population from individuals who are involuntarily committed 
through a judicial process.
    (b) Limiting Liability for Mental Health Professionals.--Any mental 
health professional who does not report under a reporting system 
established under section 2(a)(1), in accordance with guidelines 
established under section 4(a), information described in paragraph (2),

such respective paragraph, shall not be held liable in any civil action 
in State or Federal court for any damages resulting from such failure 
to report such information.
    (c) Determination of Dangerousness.--For purposes of this Act, a 
determination of dangerousness, with respect to an individual, shall be 
predicated on the presence of either--

        as manifested by evidence of, threats of, or attempts at, 
        suicide or serious bodily harm; or

        individual as manifested by evidence of homicidal or other

        appropriate entity) to conduct a comprehensive study on State 
        statutes, enacted before the date of the enactment of this Act, 
        that require mental health professionals to directly report 
        certain individuals into State firearm prohibition databases.

        include consideration of the following:

                interventions for preventing firearm-related violence.
                    (D) Any other relevant considerations, as 
                determined by the Institute of Medicine (or, if

                                striking ``adjudicated as a mental 
                                defective,'' and inserting 
                                ``adjudicated as ineligible due to 
                                disqualifying mental status''; and
                                    (II) in subsection (c)(3), by 
                                striking ``adjudicated as a mental 
                                defective,'' and inserting 
                                ``adjudicated as ineligible due to 
                                disqualifying mental status''.
            (2) References.--For purposes of each provision amended by 
        paragraph (1), a reference to a person adjudicated as 
        ineligible due to disqualifying mental status shall be 
        considered to refer to a person adjudicated as a mental 
        defective, as defined for that provision on the day before the 
        date of enactment of this Act.
            (3) Regulations.--For purposes of regulations issued to 
        carry out a provision amended by paragraph (1)--
                    (A) before the regulations are amended to carry out 
                this subsection a reference in the regulations to a 
                person adjudicated as a mental defective shall be 
                considered to be a reference to a person adjudicated as 
                ineligible due to disqualifying mental status; and
                    (B) in amending the regulations to carry out this 
                subsection, a Federal agency shall ensure that the 
                regulations clearly state that persons adjudicated as 
                ineligible due to disqualifying mental status were 
                formerly termed persons adjudicated as a mental 
                defective.
            (4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        be construed to alter or otherwise affect the definition of 
        persons previously termed ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' 
        under provisions amended by paragraph (1).
