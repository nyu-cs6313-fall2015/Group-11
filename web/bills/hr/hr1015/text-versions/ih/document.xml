			 Huntington’s Disease typically results in the development of symptoms in
			 individuals between 30 and 50 years of age. Late-onset Huntington’s Disease is
			 characterized by development of symptoms after 50 years of age and is usually
			 associated with a milder course of the disease. Juvenile Huntington’s Disease
			 affects individuals who have yet to attain 19 years of age and progresses at a

			 rules for the medical evaluation of neurological disabilities since 1985. The
			 designation of this disease by the Social Security Administration as
			 <quote>Huntington’s Chorea</quote> is both outdated and medically inaccurate,
			 as this term fails to recognize the behavioral and cognitive impact of
			 Huntington's Disease, while also providing an incomplete characterization of
			 the full spectrum of Huntington’s Disease for purposes of Social Security
			 Disability Insurance and the Medicare program.</text>
