                                 A BILL


 
   To authorize further assistance to Israel for the Iron Dome anti-
                        missile defense system.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Iron Dome Support Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The State of Israel remains under grave threat and 
        frequent attack from missiles, rockets, and mortar shells fired 
        at Israeli civilian targets by militants from the Foreign 
        Terrorist Organization Hamas on its southern border and by the 
        Foreign Terrorist Organization Hezbollah on its northern 
        border, which have killed, wounded, or inflicted psychological 
        trauma on countless Israelis.
            (2) The United States remains committed to Israel's 
        qualitative military edge, including its advantage over non-
        state actors such as Hezbollah and Hamas, which boast 
        increasingly sophisticated and powerful weapons as a result of 
        support from Iran, Syria, and other state actors.
            (3) The Israeli Defense Forces report that the Iron Dome 
        anti-missile defense system has achieved a success rate of more 
        than 85 percent, intercepting rockets bound for residential 
        neighborhoods, busy road junctions, shopping centers, and 
        crowded streets in southern Israel.
            (4) The recent success of the Iron Dome anti-missile 
        defense system during Operation Pillar of Defense averted 
        massive Israeli casualties, thereby eliminating Israel's need 
        to conduct a ground-based attack against Gaza-based terrorists, 
        enhancing Israel's operational flexibility, and preventing 
        terrorists from plunging the region into crisis whenever they 
        choose.
            (5) The United States can help to advance its own vital 
        national security interests and the cause of Middle Eastern 
        peace and stability by supporting Israel's ability to defend 
        itself against missiles, rockets, and other threats.
            (6) Israel has indicated that it is ready to share the 
        technology of the Iron Dome anti-missile defense system with 
        the United States for the United States use to strengthen the 
        United States defense capabilities.
            (7) The Government of Israel currently has five operational 
        Iron Dome batteries deployed in the field, which are far from 
        sufficient to protect all of Israel's territory.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE TO ISRAEL FOR IRON DOME ANTI-
              MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.

    The President, acting through the Secretary of Defense and the 
Secretary of State, is authorized to provide assistance, upon request 
by the Government of Israel, for the procurement, maintenance, 
enhancement, and sustainment of the Iron Dome defense system for 
purposes of intercepting short-range and medium-range rockets, 
missiles, and projectiles launched against Israel.
                                 <all>
