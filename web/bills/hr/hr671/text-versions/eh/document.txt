        trauma as a stressor described in section 3.304(f)(3) of title 
        38, Code of Federal Regulations; and
            (2) recognizing the full range of physical and mental 
        disabilities (including depression, anxiety, and other 
        disabilities as indicated in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
        Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American 
        Psychiatric Association) that can result from military sexual 
        trauma.
    (c) Provision of Information.--During the period beginning on the 
date that is 15 months after the date of the enactment of this Act and 
ending on the date on which the Secretary updates and improves 
regulations as described in subsection (b), the Secretary shall--

        claim or been treated for military sexual trauma at a medical

        Code, as added by subsection (a)(1), that has most recently 
        been submitted to Congress;
            (2) provide on a monthly basis to each veteran who has

                stress disorder;
                    (D) the three most common reasons for such denials;
                    (E) the average time for completion of covered 
                claims;
                    (F) the average time for processing covered claims 
                at each regional office; and
                    (G) any information the Secretary determines 
                relevant with respect to submitting a covered claim;
            (3) in addition to providing to veterans the information 
        described in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall make available 
        on a monthly basis such information on a conspicuous location 
        of the Internet website of the Department; and
            (4) submit to Congress on a monthly basis a report that 
        includes--
                    (A) a list of all adjudicated covered claims, 
                including ancillary claims, during the month covered by 
                the report;

                claim.

            (1) The term ``covered claim'' has the meaning given that 
        term in section 1164(c)(1) of title 38, United States Code, as 
        added by subsection (a)(1).
