   To amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the disability 
compensation evaluation procedure of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
 for veterans with mental health conditions related to military sexual 
                    trauma, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ruth Moore Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. STANDARD OF PROOF FOR SERVICE-CONNECTION OF MENTAL HEALTH 
              CONDITIONS RELATED TO MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA.

    (a) Standard of Proof.--Section 1154 of title 38, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(c)(1) In the case of any veteran who claims that a covered 
mental health condition was incurred in or aggravated by military 
sexual trauma during active military, naval, or air service, the 
Secretary shall accept as sufficient proof of service-connection a 
diagnosis of such mental health condition by a mental health 
professional together with satisfactory lay or other evidence of such 
trauma and an opinion by the mental health professional that such 
covered mental health condition is related to such military sexual 
trauma, if consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships 
of such service, notwithstanding the fact that there is no official 
record of such incurrence or aggravation in such service, and, to that 
end, shall resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran. 
Service-connection of such covered mental health condition may be 
rebutted by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. The reasons 
for granting or denying service-connection in each case shall be 
recorded in full.
    ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, in the absence of clear and 
convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided that the claimed 
military sexual trauma is consistent with the circumstances, 
conditions, or hardships of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay 
testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed military 
sexual trauma.
    ``(3) In this subsection:
            ``(A) The term `covered mental health condition' means 
        post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, or other 
        mental health diagnosis described in the current version of the 
        Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published 
        by the American Psychiatric Association that the Secretary 
        determines to be related to military sexual trauma.
            ``(B) The term `military sexual trauma' means, with respect 
        to a veteran, psychological trauma, which in the judgment of a 
        mental health professional, resulted from a physical assault of 
        a sexual nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual 
        harassment which occurred during active military, naval, or air 
        service.''.
