SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Department of Defense, 3,374 sexual 
        assault cases involving a member of the Armed Forces were 
        reported in fiscal year 2012, a 6 percent increase in the 
        number of reported cases in fiscal year 2011.
            (2) However, approximately 26,000 members of the Armed 
        Forces made an anonymous report of a sexual assault in fiscal 
        year 2012, a substantial increase from fiscal year 2011.
            (3) According to the Department of Defense, of the 6.1 
        percent of female members of the Armed Forces who experienced 
        ``unwanted sexual contact'' in fiscal year 2012, 77 percent 
        also experienced sexual harassment and, of the 1.2 percent of 
        male members of the Armed Forces who experienced ``unwanted 
        sexual contact'' in fiscal year 2012, 52 percent also 
        experienced sexual harassment.
            (4) Sixty-two percent of those members who experienced 
        unwanted sexual contact also perceived some form of social, 
        administrative, or professional retaliation.
            (5) Climate assessments are required by law and commanders 
        at all levels must comply as it is their core responsibility to 
        create a safe and healthy environment for the unit.
            (6) Trends in bad behavior and reoccurring actions that 
        harm the members of the unit, such as sexual harassment and 
        sexual assault, must be identified earlier through improved 
        performance assessments and better reporting by commanders at 
        all levels.
            (7) According to a recent Government Accountability Office 
        report, two of the primary reasons why members decide not to 
        report sexual harassment and sexual assault incidents are 
        because they do not think anything will be done about the 
        incident if they report it and they think that reporting the 
        incident will adversely impact their military career.
            (8) As long as commanders at any level continue to condone 
        or ignore certain types of sexual misconduct, this behavior 
        will continue to be prevalent in the military obstructing the 
        change in culture.
