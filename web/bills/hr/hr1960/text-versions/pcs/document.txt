              COMPARTMENT OF OHIO-CLASS REPLACEMENT PROGRAM WITH THE 
              UNITED KINGDOM'S VANGUARD SUCCESSOR PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Polaris Sales Agreement of 1963 formally arranged 
        for the Polaris missile system to be purchased by the United 
        Kingdom for its submarines. It was extended in 1982 to include 
        the Trident missile system and this agreement continues to 
        underpin the independent nuclear deterrent of the United 
        Kingdom.
            (2) April 2013 marked the 50-year anniversary of the 
        agreement.
            (3) Since the inception of the agreement, the agreement has 
        been a tremendous success and provided great benefits to both 
        nations by creating major cost savings, stronger nuclear 
        deterrence, and a stronger alliance.
            (4) The Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine replacement 
        of the United States and the Vanguard-class ballistic missile 
        successor of the United Kingdom will share a common missile 
        compartment and the Trident II/D5 strategic weapon system.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy should make every 
effort to ensure that the common missile compartment associated with 
the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine replacement program stays on 
schedule and is aligned with the Vanguard-successor program of the 
United Kingdom in order for the United States to fulfill its 
longstanding commitment to our ally and partner in sea-based strategic 
deterrence.

SEC. 224. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COUNTER-ELECTRONICS HIGH POWER MICROWAVE 
              MISSILE PROJECT.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) following the successful joint technology capability 
        demonstration that the counter-electronics high power microwave 
        missile project (in this section referred to as ``CHAMP'') 
        conducted last year, the Air Force should examine the results 
        of the demonstration and consider the demonstration as a 
        potential solution during any analysis of alternatives 
        conducted in 2014;
            (2) an analysis of alternatives is an important step in the 
        long term-term development of a high power microwave weapon;
            (3) additionally, a near-term option may be available to 
        get such capability to commanders of the combatant commands 
        should the capability be required;
            (4) the Secretary of the Air Force should pursue both near- 
        and long-term high power microwave weapon systems;
            (5) CHAMP could be developed as a cruise missile delivered 
        weapon with target availability to commanders of the combatant 
        commands by 2016; and
            (6) such development should not prohibit or divert 
        resources from an analysis of alternatives and long-term 
        development of a high power microwave weapon.

SEC. 232. ADDITIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE SITE IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 
              OPTIMIZED PROTECTION OF THE HOMELAND.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama 
        have each recognized the necessity for an additional measure of 
        protection-beyond missile defense sites in Alaska and 
        California-for defending the United States against 
        intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) threats emanating 
        from the Middle East.
            (2) General Jacoby, the Commander of the United States 
        Northern Command, testified before Congress that ``we should 
        consider that Iran has a capability within the next few years 
        of flight testing ICBM capable technologies'' and that ``the 
        Iranians are intent on developing an ICBM''.
            (3) General Kehler, the Commander of the United States 
        Strategic Command, testified before Congress that ``I am 
        confident that we can defend against a limited attack from 
        Iran, although we are not in the most optimum posture to do 
        that today * * * it doesn't provide total defense today''.
            (4) General Jacoby also testified before Congress that ``I 
        would agree that a third site, wherever the decision is to 
        build a third site, would give me better weapons access, 
        increased GBI inventory and allow us the battle space to more 
        optimize our defense against future threats from Iran and North 
        Korea''.
            (5) Section 227 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law 112-239; 126 Stat. 1678) 
        directs the Missile Defense Agency--
                    (A) to conduct environmental impact studies for 
                three potential locations for an additional missile 
                defense site capable of protecting the homeland; and
                    (B) to develop a contingency plan in case the 
                President determines to proceed with deployment of such 
                an additional site.
            (6) According the Missile Defense Agency, the cost to 
        deploy up to 20 ground-based interceptors (GBIs) at a new 
        missile defense site on the East Coast of the United States is 
        approximately $3,000,000,000 and would require approximately 5 
        to 6 years to complete.
    (b) Additional Missile Defense Site.--
            (1) In general.--The Missile Defense Agency shall construct 
        and make operational in fiscal year 2018 an additional homeland 
        missile defense site capable of protecting the homeland, 
        designed to complement existing sites in Alaska and California, 
        to deal more effectively with the long-range ballistic missile 
        threat from the Middle East.
            (2) Requirement in addition to other required activities 
        regarding missile defense sites.--The Missile Defense Agency 
        shall carry out the requirement in paragraph (1) to construct 
        and deploy an additional homeland missile defense site 
        (including any advance procurement and engineering and design 
        in connection with such site) while continuing to meet the 
        requirement to prepare environmental impact statements and a 
        contingency plan under section 227 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 for the missile defense 
        sites described in that section.
            (3) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Director of the Missile Defense 
        Agency shall submit to Congress a report on the missile defense 
        site required to be constructed and deployed under paragraph 
        (1). The report shall include a description of the current 
        estimate of the funding to be required for construction and 
        deployment of the missile defense site, including for advance 
        procurement, engineering and design, materials and 
        construction, interceptor missiles, and sensors.

            (1) the missile defenses of the United States provide 
        defense against multiple threats, including threats to the 
        United States, allies of the United States, and the deployed 
        forces of the United States; and
            (2) the elimination of one threat, for example the illegal 
        nuclear weapons program of a rogue state, does not eliminate 
        the reason the United States deploys missile defenses to a 
        particular region, including to defend allies of the United 
        States and deployed forces of the United States from other 
        regional threats.
    (b) Limitation.--Except as provided by subsection (c) or (d), none 
of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise 
made available for fiscal year 2014 or any fiscal year thereafter may 
be obligated or expended to remove missile defense equipment of the 
United States from East Asia until a period of 180 days has elapsed 
following the date on which the President certifies to the 
congressional defense committees the following:
            (1) Each country in East Asia that poses a threat to allies 
        of the United States has verifiably dismantled the nuclear 
        weapons and ballistic missile programs of such country.
            (2) The President has consulted with such allies with 
        respect to the dismantlement described in paragraph (1) that--
                    (A) such dismantlement has occurred; and
                    (B) the missile defense platforms of the United 
                States located in East Asia are no longer needed.
    (c) Waiver.--The President may waive the limitation in subsection 
(b) with respect to removing missile defense equipment of the United 
States from East Asia if--
            (1) the President submits to the congressional defense 
        committees--
                    (A) a certification that such waiver is in the 
                national security interest of the United States; and
                    (B) a report, in unclassified form, explaining--
                            (i) why the President cannot make a 
                        certification for such removal under subsection 
                        (b);
                            (ii) the national security interest covered 
                        by the certification made under subparagraph 
                        (A); and
                            (iii) how the President will provide a 
                        commensurate level of defense for the United 
                        States, allies of the United States, and 
                        deployed forces of the United States, as 
                        provided by such missile defense equipment 
                        being removed; and

SEC. 238. NATO AND THE PHASED, ADAPTIVE APPROACH TO MISSILE DEFENSE IN 
              EUROPE.

    (a) NATO Funding.--
            (1) Phase i of epaa.--Not later than 60 days after the date 
        of the enactment of this Act, the President shall consult with 
        the North Atlantic Council and the Secretary General of the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization (in this section referred to 
        as ``NATO'') on--
                    (A) the funding of the phased, adaptive approach to 
                missile defense in Europe; and
                    (B) establishing a plan for NATO to provide at 
                least 50 percent of the infrastructure and operations 
                and maintenance costs of phase I of the phased, 
                adaptive approach to missile defense in Europe.
            (2) Phases ii and iii of epaa.--The President shall use the 
        NATO Military Common-Funded Resources process to seek to fund 
        at least 50 percent of the costs for phases II and III of the 
        phased, adaptive approach to missile defense in Europe.
            (3) Reports.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, and each 180-day period thereafter, the

through the phased, adaptive approach to missile defense in Europe.

SEC. 239. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PROCUREMENT OF CAPABILITY ENHANCEMENT II 
              EXOATMOSPHERIC KILL VEHICLE.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense should 
not procure a Capability Enhancement II exoatmospheric kill vehicle for 
deployment until after the date on which a successful operational 
flight test of the Capability Enhancement II ground-based interceptor 
has occurred unless such procurement is for test assets or to maintain 
a warm line for the industrial base.

SEC. 240. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STRATEGIC 
              DEFENSE INITIATIVE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) President Ronald Reagan in March 1983, in a speech from 
        the oval office, laid the corner stone for a long-term research 
        and development program to begin to achieve our ultimate goal 
        of eliminating the threat posed by strategic nuclear missiles.
            (2) President Reagan stated, ``I've become more and more 
        deeply convinced that the human spirit must be capable of 
        rising above dealing with other nations and human beings by 
        threatening their existence * * * What if free people could 
        live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest 
        upon the threat of instant United States retaliation to deter a 
        Soviet attack, that we could intercept and destroy strategic 
        ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of 
        our allies?''.
            (3) The Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as ``Star 
        Wars'', challenged the nation to accomplish the impossible by 
        moving beyond the obvious possibilities of the day to set the 
        United States and our allies up for success.
            (4) In 1999, the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization 
        (BMDO), National Missile Defense (NMD) prototype interceptor 
        successfully demonstrated ``hit-to-kill'' technology 
        intercepting a modified Minuteman intercontinental Ballistic 
        Missile (ICBM).
            (5) Congress passed the National Missile Defense Act of 
        1999 (Public Law 106-38) (signed by President Clinton), which 
        stated, ``It is the policy of the United States to deploy, as 
        soon as is technologically possible, an effective National 
        Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of 
        the United States against limited ballistic missile attack 
        (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate)''.
            (6) On December 13, 2001, President George W. Bush 
        announced ``I have concluded the ABM treaty hinders our 
        government's ability to develop ways to protect our people from 
        future terrorist or rogue state missile attacks''.
            (7) Russian President Vladimir Putin said the move was 
        ``not a threat to the security of the Russian Federation''.
            (8) Since 2001, the United States has deployed considerable 
        Missile Defense capability: 30 ground-based interceptors 
        defending the continental U.S. today; 32 Aegis BMD ships; 113 
        SM-3 IA interceptors; 25 SM-3 IB interceptors; 3 THAAD 
        batteries and 89 interceptors; and 8 AN/TPY-2 forward-based 
        sensors.
            (9) The United States has partnerships with 22 nations, and 
        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), for missile 
        defense cooperation. Likewise, India and South Korea are 
        developing missile defenses and the Russian Federation and 
        People's Republic of China are also developing and improving 
        missile defenses.
            (10) Since 2001 when they began development, United States 
        missile defenses have had a test record of 58 of 73 hit-to-kill 
        intercept attempts and have been successful across all programs 
        of the integrated system, including Aegis Ballistic Missile 
        Defense (BMD), Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Terminal 
        High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), and PATRIOT Advanced 
        Capability-3.
            (11) In July of 2004, the United States missile defense 
        system was declared operational with limited capability. Since 
        that time, it has offered defense against limited threats to 
        the continental United States.
            (12) The United States has cooperatively developed with our 
        Israeli allies a number of missile defense systems including 
        Arrow, Arrow 3 and David's Sling, systems which will protector 
        our Israeli allies and contribute technology and expertise to 
        United States systems.
            (13) The United States in support of NATO deployed a 
        Patriot missile battery to defend the population and territory 
        of Turkey and provide material support for Article V of the 
        North Atlantic Treaty in the event of spillover from the Syrian 
        civil war and has deployed Phase I of the European Phased 
        Adaptive Approach, which includes a transportable x-band radar 
        array and an on-station AEGIS ballistic missile defense ship 
        armed with Standard Missile 3 block IA missile interceptors.
            (14) When United States territory, deployed forces and 
        allies were threatened by North Korean ballistic missiles the 
        United States had the operational capability and national will 
        to deploy THAAD units to Guam to provide a defensive shield.
            (15) The United States continues to work jointly with Japan 
        to improve the Navy Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) which 
        in addition to providing missile defense in the Pacific is also 
        a keystone in the Phased Adaptive Approach for European missile 
        defense.
            (16) On-going research and development under the auspices 
        of the Missile Defense Agency will continue to expand the 
        technology envelope to deploy a layered missile defense system 
        capable of defending the homeland, our military forces deployed 
        overseas, friendly nations and our allies against all ballistic 
        missiles from launch and orbit to reentry.
            (17) A credible ballistic missile defense system is 
        critical to the national defense of the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes the inspiring leadership of President Ronald 
        Reagan to ``maintain the peace through strength'';
            (2) recognizes the enduring obligation President as 
        Commander in Chief to`` preserve, protect, and defend the 
        Constitution'';
            (3) commemorates the vision of President Reagan on the 30th 
        anniversary of the Strategic Defense Initiative;
            (4) believes that it is imperative that the United States 
        continue fielding a robust missile defense system, including 
        additional ground based interceptors; and
            (5) commits to supporting continued investments in future 
        missile defense capabilities and emerging technologies such as 
        directed energy and railguns.

SEC. 241. READINESS OF INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE FORCE.

    The Secretary of Defense shall preserve each intercontinental 
ballistic missile silo that contains a deployed missile as of the date 
of the enactment of this Act in, at minimum, a warm status that enables 
such silo to--
            (1) remain a fully functioning element of the 
        interconnected and redundant command and control system of the 
        missile field; and
            (2) be made fully operational with a deployed missile.

SEC. 242. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NEGOTIATIONS AFFECTING THE MISSILE 
              DEFENSES OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On April 15, 2013, the National Security Advisor to the 
        President, Tom Donilon, conveyed a personal letter from 
        President Obama to the President of the Russian Federation, 
        Vladimir Putin.
            (2) Press reports indicate that in this letter the 
        President proposed, ``developing a legally-binding agreement on 
        transparency, which would include exchange of information to 
        confirm that our programs do not pose a threat to each other's 
        deterrence forces,'' through ``a so-called executive agreement, 
        for which [the President] does not need to seek the consent of 
        Congress.''.
            (3) The Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia, Sergei Ryabkov, 
        stated in response to the letter that, ``the proposals of the 
        U.S. side on the issue are quite concrete and are related in a 
        certain way to the discussions our countries had at various 
        levels in the past years. And it cannot be said from this point 
        of view that the offers are decorative and not serious. No, I 
        want to emphasize that we are committing to the seriousness of 
        these proposals but we note their insufficiency.''.
            (4) Press reports indicate that the Secretary of the 
        Russian Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, conveyed a 
        response to the letter from President Putin.
            (5) President Obama's proposed deal with Russian President 
        Putin has been kept secret from Congress and the American 
        people.
            (6) The Administration has systematically denied Congress 
        information about past offers of United States missile defense 
        concessions to Russia, including written requests from Members 
        of the House of Representatives.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should promptly convey to Congress the 
        details of any proposed deals with the Russian Federation 
        concerning the missile defenses or nuclear arms of the United 
        States; and
            (2) the missile defenses of the United States are central 
        to the defense of the homeland from ballistic missile threats, 
        particularly if nuclear deterrence fails, thus such defenses 
        are not something that the President should continue to trade 
        away for the prospects of nuclear arms reductions with Russia, 
        the People's Republic of China, or any other foreign country.

                          Subtitle D--Reports

              IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In February 2012, the Secretary of Defense notified 
        Congress of the intent of the Secretary to rescind the co-
        location restriction and to implement policy exceptions to 
        allow female members of the Armed Forces to be assigned to 
        specified positions in ground combat units at the battalion 
        level.
            (2) On January 24, 2013, the Secretary of Defense and the 
        Joint Chiefs of Staff issued guidance to rescind the direct 
        combat exclusion rule for female members of the Armed Forces 
        and eliminate all unnecessary gender-based barriers to service 
        in the Armed Forces.
            (3) The Secretaries of the military departments were 
        required to develop and submit their plans for implementation 
        of the rescission of the direct combat exclusion rule by May 
        15, 2013.
            (4) As of 2013, there are approximately 202,000 female 
        members of the Armed Forces, approximately 20,000 female 
        members have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, and more than 60 
        female members have been killed in combat.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretaries of the military departments--
            (1) no later than September 2015, should develop, review, 
        and validate individual occupational standards, using validated 
        gender-neutral occupational standards, so as to assess and 
        assign members of the Armed Forces to units, including Special 
        Operations Forces; and
            (2) no later than January 1, 2016, should complete all

otherwise give rise to Federal jurisdiction or create a right of 
removal.

child custody proceeding involving a temporary order as contemplated in 
this section provides a higher standard of protection to the rights of

SEC. 555. TRANSITION OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THEIR FAMILIES 
              FROM MILITARY TO CIVILIAN LIFE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Members of the Armed Forces and their families make 
        great sacrifices on behalf of the United States, and, when 
        their active duty service is successfully concluded, members 
        deserve the opportunity to also make a successful transition to 
        the civilian labor force.
            (2) When transitioning from active duty in the Armed Forces 
        to civilian employment, members often face barriers that make 
        it difficult to fully utilize the skills and training they 
        gained during their military service.
            (3) Members and veterans are too often required to repeat 
        education or training in order to receive industry 
        certifications and State occupational licenses, even though 
        their military training and experience often overlaps with the 
        certification or licensing requirements.
            (4) When members are transferred from military assignment 
        to military assignment, their spouses often face barriers to 
        transferring their credentials and to securing employment in 
        their new location.
            (5) More than one million members will make the transition 
        to civilian life in the coming years.
            (6) The Department of Defense established the Military 
        Credentialing and Licensing Task Force in 2012.
            (7) The Joining Forces program, a national initiative to 
        mobilize all sectors of society to give members of the Armed 
        Forces and their families the opportunities and support they 
        have earned, will make it easier for members and their families 
        to transfer skills learned while the member was serving in the 
        Armed Forces to civilian employment.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Federal Government and State governments should 
        make the transition of a member of the Armed Forces and the 
        member's spouse from military to civilian life as seamless as 
        possible by creating opportunities for the member and spouse to 
        earn, while the member is in the Armed Forces, civilian 
        occupational credentials and licenses, with an emphasis on 
        well-paying industries and occupations that have a high demand 
        for skilled workers, including: manufacturing, information 
        technology, transportation and logistics, health care, and 
        emergency medical services;
            (2) the Federal Government should assist State governments 
        in translating military training and experience into credit 
        towards professional licensure; and
            (3) State governments should streamline approaches for 
        assessing the equivalency of military training and experience, 
        and accelerate occupational licensing processes for members, 
        veterans, and their spouses.

        that injury or deployment may constitute matters in extenuation 
        that relate to the basis for administrative separation under

                Antarctic.
                    (C) Map and photograph a full two-thirds of the 
                Antarctic Continent during the classified, hazardous 
                duty/volunteer-only operation involving 4700 sailors, 
                23 aircraft and 13 ships including the first submarine 
                the U.S.S. Sennet, and the aircraft carrier the U.S.S. 
                Philippine Sea, brought to the edge of the ice pack to 
                launch (6) Navy ski-equipped, rocket-assisted R4Ds.
                    (D) Consolidate and extend United States 
                sovereignty over the largest practicable area of the 
                Antarctic continent.
                    (E) Determine the feasibility of establishing, 
                maintaining and utilizing bases in the Antarctic and 
                investigating possible base sites.
            (3) While on a hazardous duty/all volunteer mission vital 
        to the interests of National Security and while over the 
        eastern Antarctica coastline known as the Phantom Coast, the 
        PBM-5 Martin Mariner ``Flying Boat'' ``George 1'' entered a 
        whiteout over Thurston Island. As the pilot attempted to climb, 
        the aircraft grazed the glacier's ridgeline and exploded within 
        5 seconds instantly killing Ensign Maxwell Lopez, Navigator and 
        Wendell ``Bud'' Hendersin, Aviation Machinists Mate 1st Class 
        while Frederick Williams, Aviation Radioman 1st Class died 
        several hours later. Six other crewmen survived including the 
        Captain of the ``George 1's'' seaplane tender U.S.S. Pine 
        Island.
            (4) The bodies of the dead were protected from the 
        desecration of Antarctic scavenging birds (Skuas) by the 
        surviving crew wrapping the bodies and temporarily burying the 
        men under the starboard wing engine nacelle.
            (5) Rescue requirements of the ``George-1'' survivors 
        forced the abandonment of their crewmates' bodies.
            (6) Conditions prior to the departure of Task Force 68 
        precluded a return to the area to the recover the bodies.
            (7) For nearly 60 years Navy promised the families that 
        they would recover the men: ``If the safety, logistical, and 
        operational prerequisites allow a mission in the future, every 
        effort will be made to bring our sailors home.''.
            (8) The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command twice offered to 
        recover the bodies of this crew for Navy.
            (9) A 2004 NASA ground penetrating radar overflight 
        commissioned by Navy relocated the crash site three miles from 
        its crash position.
            (10) The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command offered to 
        underwrite the cost of an aerial ground penetrating radar (GPR) 
        survey of the crash site area by NASA.
            (11) The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command studied the 
        recovery with the recognized recovery authorities and national 
        scientists and determined that the recovery is only ``medium 
        risk''.
            (12) National Science Foundation and scientists from the 
        University of Texas, Austin, regularly visit the island.
            (13) The crash site is classified as a ``perishable site'', 
        meaning a glacier that will calve into the Bellingshausen Sea.
            (14) The National Science Foundation maintains a presence 
        in area--of the Pine Island Glacier.
            (15) The National Science Foundation Director of Polar 
        Operations will assist and provide assets for the recovery upon 
        the request of Congress.
            (16) The United States Coast Guard is presently pursuing 
        the recovery of 3 WWII air crewmen from similar circumstances 
        in Greenland.
            (17) On Memorial Day, May 25, 2009, President Barack Obama 
        declared: ``* * * the support of our veterans is a sacred trust 
        * * * we need to serve them as they have served us * * * that 
        means bringing home all our POWs and MIAs * * *''.
            (18) The policies and laws of the United States of America 
        require that our armed service personnel be repatriated.
            (19) The fullest possible accounting of United States 
        fallen military personnel means repatriating living American 
        POWs and MIAs, accounting for, identifying, and recovering the 
        remains of military personnel who were killed in the line of 
        duty, or providing convincing evidence as to why such a 
        repatriation, accounting, identification, or recovery is not 
        possible.
            (20) It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to 
        return to the United States for proper burial and respect all 
        members of the Armed Forces killed in the line of duty who lie 
        in lost graves.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings under subsection 
(a), Congress--
            (1) reaffirms its support for the recovery and return to 
        the United States, the remains and bodies of all members of the 
        Armed Forces killed in the line of duty, and for the efforts by 
        the Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command to recover the remains of 
        members of the Armed Forces from all wars, conflicts and 
        missions;
            (2) recognizes the courage and sacrifice of all members of 
        the Armed Forces who participated in Operation Highjump and all 
        missions vital to the national security of the United States of 
        America;
            (3) acknowledges the dedicated research and efforts by the 
        US Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, the 
        Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, the Fallen American Veterans 
        Foundation and all persons and organizations to identify, 
        locate, and advocate for, from their temporary Antarctic grave, 
        the recovery of the well-preserved frozen bodies of Ensign 
        Maxwell Lopez, Naval Aviator, Frederick Williams, Aviation 
        Machinist's Mate 1ST Class, Wendell Hendersin, Aviation 
        Radioman 1ST Class of the ``George 1'' explosion and crash; and
            (4) encourages the Department of Defense to review the 
        facts, research and to pursue new efforts to undertake all 
        feasible efforts to recover, identify, and return the well-
        preserved frozen bodies of the ``George 1'' crew from 
        Antarctica's Thurston Island.

SEC. 734. INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF 
              DEFENSE AND VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) despite repeated attempts at cooperation over the past 
        20 years, the Department of Defense and the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs have failed to implement a solution that 
        allows for seamless electronic sharing of medical health care 
        data;
            (2) the recent decision by the Secretary of Defense and the 
        Secretary of Veterans Affairs to abandon their earlier 
        agreement and pursue separate paths to integration jeopardizes 
        the stated goal of providing ``a patient-centered health care 
        system that delivers excellent quality, access, satisfaction, 
        and value, consistently across the Departments'';
            (3) despite the repeated concerns and objections of the 
        congressional committees of jurisdiction, the Department of 
        Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs seem to be on a 
        continued path to fail in achieving the goal of creating a 
        seamless health record that integrates data across the 
        Departments; and
            (4) the President should make the necessary leadership 
        changes to assure timely completion of this requirement.
    (b) Implementation.--The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs shall--
            (1) implement an integrated electronic health record to be 
        used by each of the Secretaries; and
            (2) deploy such record by not later than October 1, 2016.
    (c) Design Principles.--The integrated electronic health record 
established under subsection (b) shall adhere to the following 
principles:
            (1) To the extent practicable, efforts to establish such 
        record shall be based on objectives, activities, and milestones 
        established by the Joint Executive Committee Joint Strategic 
        Plan Fiscal Years 2013-2015, including any requirements, 
        definition, documents, or analyses previously developed to 
        satisfy said Joint Strategic Plan.
            (2) Principles with respect to open architecture standards, 
        including--
                    (A) modular designs based on standards with loose 
                coupling and high cohesion that allow for independent 
                acquisition of system components;
                    (B) if existing national standards do not exist as 
                of the date on which the record is being established, 
                the Secretaries shall agree upon and adopt a standard 
                for purposes of the record until such time as national 
                standards are established;
                    (C) enterprise investment strategies that maximize 
                reuse of proven system designs;
                    (D) implementation of aggressive life-cycle 
                sustainment planning that uses proven technology 
                insertion strategies and product upgrade techniques;
                    (E) enforcement of system design transparency, 
                continuous design disclosure and improvement, and peer 
                reviews that include government, academia, and 
                industry; and
                    (F) strategies for data-use rights to ensure a 
                level competitive playing field and access to 
                alternative solutions and sources across the life-cycle 
                of the program.
            (3) By the point of full deployment decision, such record 
        must be at a generation 3 level or better for a health 
        information technology system.
    (d) Program Plan.--Not later than January 31, 2014, the Secretaries

        program;
            (7) outcome-based metrics proposed to measure the 
        performance and effectiveness of the program; and

                value of the software.

                department shall retain the royalties and other

                that increase the potential for transfer of the 
                technology of the laboratories;
                    (iv) for payment of expenses incidental to the 
                administration and licensing of computer software or

        year exceed 5 percent of the funds received for use by the DOD 
        laboratory for research, development, engineering, testing, and 
        evaluation or other related administrative, processing or 
        value-added activities for that year, 75 percent of such excess

        value of an award for the same project or effort shall be 
        deducted from the amount otherwise available under this 
        paragraph. Payments, determined under the terms of this 
        paragraph and made to an employee developer as such, may

SEC. 1024. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING A BALANCED FUTURE NAVAL FORCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The battle force of the Navy must be sufficiently sized 
        and balanced in capability to meet current and anticipated 
        future national security objectives.
            (2) A robust and balanced naval force is required for the 
        Department of Defense to fully execute the President's National 
        Security Strategy.
            (3) To develop and sustain required capabilities the Navy 
        must balance investment and maintenance costs across various 
        ship types, including--
                    (A) aircraft carriers;
                    (B) surface combatants;
                    (C) submarines;
                    (D) amphibious assault ships; and
                    (E) other auxiliary vessels, including support 
                vessels operated by the Military Sealift Command.
            (4) Despite a Marine Corps requirement for 38 amphibious 
        assault ships, the Navy possesses only 30 amphibious assault 
        ships with an average of 22 ships available for surge 
        deployment.
            (5) The inadequate level of investment in Navy shipbuilding 
        over the last 20 years has resulted in--
                    (A) a fragile shipbuilding industrial base, both in 
                the construction yards and secondary suppliers of 
                materiel and equipment; and
                    (B) increased costs per vessel stemming from low 
                production volume.
            (6) The Department of Defense, Military Construction and 
        Veterans Affairs, and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2013 provided $263,000,000 towards the advance 
        procurement of materiel and equipment required to continue the 
        San Antonio LPD 17 amphibious transport dock class to a total 
        of 12 ships, a key first step in rebalancing the amphibious 
        assault ship force structure.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the Sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Defense and the Department of the 
        Navy must prioritize funding towards increased shipbuilding 
        rates to enable the Navy to meet the full-range of combatant 
        commander requests;
            (2) the Department of the Navy's future budget requests and 
        the Long Range Plan for the Construction of Naval Forces must 
        realistically anticipate and reflect the true investment 
        necessary to meet stated force structure goals;
            (3) without modification to Long Range Plan for the 
        Construction of Naval Forces shipbuilding plan, the future of 
        the industrial base that enables construction of large, combat-
        survivable amphibious assault ships is at significant risk; and
            (4) the Department of Defense and Congress should act 
        expeditiously to restore the force structure and capability 
        balance of the Navy fleet as quickly as possible.

            (1) the period beginning on the date of the expiration of 
        the lease in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act 
        and ending on the date on which the Secretary determines that a 
        substitute is available for the capabilities provided by the 
        lease, or that the capabilities provided by the vessel are no 
        longer required; or
            (2) 180 days.
    (b) Funding.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated by section 301 
and available for operation and maintenance, Navy, as specified in the 
funding tables in section 4301, may be available for the extension or 
renewal of a lease under subsection (a).
    (c) Notice to Congress.--Prior to extending or renewing a lease 
under subsection (a), the Secretary of the Navy shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees notification of the proposed extension 
or renewal. Such notification shall include--
            (1) a detailed description of the term of the proposed 
        contract for the extension or renewal of the lease and a 
        justification for extending or renewing the lease rather than 
        obtaining the capability provided for by the lease, charter, or 
        services involved through purchase of the vessel; and
            (2) a plan for meeting the capability provided for by the 
        lease upon the completion of the term of the lease contract, as 
        extended or renewed under subsection (a).

        DDG-51 destroyers.
            (2) The estimate of the Secretary of the total cost of the 
        current plan to develop, procure, operate, and support Flight

            (5) Any other information the Secretary determines 
        appropriate.

SEC. 1027. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ADVISORY BOARD ON 
              TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND WORKER HEALTH.

    It is the sense of Congress that the President should establish an

``Energy Employees Compensation: Additional Independent Oversight and 
Transparency Would Improve Program's Credibility'', numbered GAO-10-

        certifies the rest of the criteria required by subsection (b) 
        for transfers prohibited by subsection (c) and, with the 
        concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with

                mitigate such risks with regard to the individual to be 
                transferred;
                    (C) in the case of a waiver of subsection (c), the 
                Secretary has considered any confirmed case in which an 
                individual who was transferred to the country 
                subsequently engaged in terrorist activity, and the 
                actions to be taken under subparagraph (A) will 
                substantially mitigate the risk of recidivism with 
                regard to the individual to be transferred; and
                    (D) the transfer is in the national security 
                interests of the United States.
            (2) Reports.--Whenever the Secretary makes a determination 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the

SEC. 1055. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COMPLIANCE WITH NUCLEAR ARMS CONTROL 
              AGREEMENTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) President Obama stated in Prague in April 2009 that 
        ``Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words 
        must mean something.''.
            (2) President Obama's Nuclear Posture Review of 2010 
        stated, ``it is not enough to detect non-compliance; violators 
        must know that they will face consequences when they are 
        caught.''.
            (3) The July 2010 Verifiability Assessment released by the 
        Department of State on the New START Treaty stated, ``The costs 
        and risks of Russian cheating or breakout, on the other hand, 
        would likely be very significant. In addition to the financial 
        and international political costs of such an action, any 
        Russian leader considering cheating or breakout from the New 
        START Treaty would have to consider that the United States will 
        retain the ability to upload large numbers of additional 
        nuclear warheads on both bombers and missiles under the New 
        START, which would provide the ability for a timely and very 
        significant U.S. response.''.
            (4) Subsection (a) of the Resolution of Advice and Consent 
        to Ratification of the New START Treaty of the Senate, agreed 
        to on December 22, 2010, listed conditions of the Senate to the 
        ratification of the New START Treaty that are binding upon the 
        President, including the condition under paragraph (1)(B) of 
        such subsection that requires the President to take certain 
        actions in response to actions by the Russian Federation that 
        are in violation of or inconsistent with such treaty, including 
        to ``seek on an urgent basis a meeting with the Russian 
        Federation at the highest diplomatic level with the objective 
        of bringing the Russian Federation into full compliance with 
        its obligations under the New START Treaty''.
            (5) The Obama Administration demonstrated that violations 
        of treaty obligations by other parties require corresponding 
        action by the United States when, on November 22, 2011, the 
        Department of State announced that the United States would 
        ``cease carrying out certain obligations under the Conventional 
        Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty with regard to Russia. This 
        announcement in the CFE Treaty's implementation group comes 
        after the United States and NATO Allies have tried over the 
        past 4 years to find a diplomatic solution following Russia's 
        decision in 2007 to cease implementation with respect to all 
        other 29 CFE States. Since then, Russia has refused to accept 
        inspections and ceased to provide information to other CFE 
        Treaty parties on its military forces as required by the 
        Treaty.''.
            (6) On October 17, 2012, the Chairman of the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the House of Representatives and the Chairman 
        of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House 
        of Representatives wrote a classified letter to the President 
        stating their concerns about a major arms control violation by 
        the Russian Federation.
            (7) The Chairmen followed up their classified letter with 
        unclassified letters on February 14 and April 12, 2013--in 
        their latest letter, the Chairmen stated that they expect the 
        Administration to ``directly confront the Russian violations 
        and circumventions of this and other treaties. . .[we] further 
        ask, again, for your engagement in correcting this behavior. We 
        also seek your commitment not to undertake further reductions 
        to the U.S. nuclear deterrent or extended deterrent until this 
        Russian behavior is corrected. We are in full agreement with 
        your policy as you articulated it in Prague four years ago this 
        month, `rules must be binding, Violations must be punished. 
        Words must mean something.'''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
President should consider not seeking to further limit or reduce the 
nuclear forces of the United States, including by negotiation, with a 
foreign country that remains in active noncompliance with existing 
nuclear arms obligations, such as the Russian Federation.
    (c) Obligations of the President in the Event of Noncompliance.--If 
the President determines that a foreign country is not in compliance 
with its obligations under a nuclear arms control agreement, treaty, or 
commitment to which the United States is a party or in which the United 
States is a participating government, including the Missile Technology 
Control Regime, the President shall--
            (1) immediately consult with Congress regarding the 
        implications of such noncompliance for--
                    (A) the viability of such agreement, treaty, or 
                commitment; and
                    (B) the national security interests of the United 
                States and the allies of the United States;
            (2) submit to Congress a plan concerning the diplomatic 
        strategy of the President to engage such foreign country at the 
        highest diplomatic level with the objective of bringing such 
        country into full compliance with such obligations; and
            (3) at the earliest date practicable following the 
        submission of the plan under paragraph (2), submit to Congress 
        a report detailing--
                    (A) whether adherence by the United States to such 
                obligation remains in the national security interests 
                of the United States or the allies of the United 
                States; and
                    (B) how the United States will redress the effect 
                of such noncompliance to the national security 
                interests of the United States or such allies.

SEC. 1056. RETENTION OF CAPABILITY TO REDEPLOY MULTIPLE INDEPENDENTLY 
              TARGETABLE REENTRY VEHICLES.

    (a) Deployment Capability.--The Secretary of the Air Force shall 
ensure that the Air Force is capable of--
            (1) deploying multiple independently targetable reentry

        and any ground-based strategic deterrent follow-on to such 
        missiles; and
            (2) commencing such deployment not later than 270 days 
        after the date on which the President determines such 
        deployment necessary.
    (b) Warhead Capability.--The Nuclear Weapons Council established by 
section 179 of title 10, United States Code, shall ensure that--
            (1) the nuclear weapons stockpile contains a sufficient 
        number of nuclear warheads that are capable of being deployed 
        as multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles with 
        respect to Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
        and any ground-based strategic deterrent follow-on to such 
        missiles; and
            (2) such deployment is capable of being commenced not later 
        than 270 days after the date on which the President determines 
        such deployment necessary.

                    (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``, the

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the use of improvised explosive devices (in this 
        section referred to as ``IEDs'') against members of the Armed 
        Forces or people of the United States should be condemned;
            (2) unwavering support for members of the Armed Forces, 
        first responders, and explosive ordnance disposal personnel of 
        the United States who face the threat of IEDs and put their 
        lives on the line to defeat them should be expressed;
            (3) all relevant agencies of the Government should be 
        called on to coordinate with international partners and other 
        responsible entities to reduce the use of IEDs and curb their 
        proliferation; and
            (4) the exchange of blast trauma research data should be 
        facilitated between all relevant agencies of the Government.

SEC. 1096. SENSE OF CONGRESS TO MAINTAIN A STRONG NATIONAL GUARD AND 
              MILITARY RESERVE FORCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The first volunteer militia unit in America was formed 
        in 1636 in Massachusetts Bay, followed by other units in the 
        colonies of Virginia and Connecticut. the American founding 
        fathers wrote article I, section 8, of the United States 
        Constitution to keep the militia model, authorizing a standing 
        military force that could organize, train, and equip militia 
        volunteers when needed.
            (2) In World War I, nearly all National Guardsmen were 
        mobilized into Federal service, and while they represented only 
        15 percent of the total United States Army, they comprised 40 
        percent of the American divisions sent to France and sustained 
        43 percent of the casualties in combat. In World War II, the 
        National Guard comprised 19 Army divisions and 29 observation 
        squadrons with aircraft assigned to the United States Army Air 
        Forces.
            (3) On September 11, 2001, the first fighter jets over New 
        York City and Washington, DC, were Air National Guard F-15 and 
        F-16 aircraft from Massachusetts and North Dakota, with over 
        400 more Air National Guard fighter aircraft on alert by that 
        afternoon. Over 600,000 Air and Army National Guard soldiers 
        and airmen have deployed in the many campaigns since 9/11.
            (4) Air and Army National Guard soldiers and airmen have 
        been involved in countless domestic response missions, 
        including missions in response to hurricanes, tornadoes, 
        floods, and forest fires including the more recent events of 
        Superstorm Sandy and the tornados in Oklahoma.
            (5) The volunteer National Guard and Reserve have time and 
        again demonstrated their readiness to meet operational 
        requirements through cost-effective means.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of Defense should make every effort to 
        ensure the Military Reserve and National Guard forces are 
        sustained by a fully manned and fully funded force and that the 
        United States fulfill its longstanding commitment to unyielding 
        readiness in terms of defense;
            (2) the Secretary of Defense should act with the knowledge 
        that the National Guard and Reserve are critical components to 
        the Armed Forces, particularly as means of preserving combat 
        power during a time of budget austerity; and
            (3) Congress repudiates proposals to diminish the National 
        Guard or Reserve and affirms the growth of these components as 
        circumstances warrant.

SEC. 1097. ACCESS OF EMPLOYEES OF CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT OFFICES TO 
              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FACILITIES.

    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that Congressional support offices 
perform a critical role in enabling Congress to carry out its 
Constitutionally-mandated task of performing oversight of the executive 
branch.
    (b) Access in Same Manner as Employees of Defense Committees.--The 
Secretary of Defense shall provide employees of any Congressional 
support office who work on issues related to national security with 
access to facilities of the Department of Defense in the same manner, 
and subject to the same terms and conditions, as employees of the 
Committees on Armed Services of the House of Representatives and 
Senate.
    (c) Congressional Support Offices Defined.--In this section, the 
term ``Congressional support office'' means any of the following:
            (1) The Congressional Budget Office.
            (2) The Congressional Research Service of the Library of 
        Congress.
            (3) The Government Accountability Office.

SEC. 1098. COST OF WARS.

    The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Commissioner of 
the Internal Revenue Service and the Director of the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis, shall post on the public Web site of the Department of 
Defense the costs, including the relevant legacy costs, to each 
American taxpayer of each of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

SEC. 1099. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONSIDERATION OF FOREIGN 
              LANGUAGES AND CULTURES IN THE BUILDING OF PARTNER 
              CAPACITY.

    It is the sense of Congress that the head of each element of the 
Department of Defense should take into consideration foreign languages 
and cultures during the development by such element of the Department 
of training, tools, and methodologies to engage in military-to-military 
activities and in the building of partner capacity.

SEC. 1099A. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PRESERVATION OF SECOND 
              AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL 
              STATIONED OR RESIDING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution 
        provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms 
        shall not be infringed.
            (2) Approximately 40,000 servicemen and women across all 
        branches of the Armed Forces either live in or are stationed on 
        active duty within the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. 
        Unless these individuals are granted a waiver as serving in a 
        law enforcement role, they are subject to the District of 
        Columbia's onerous and highly restrictive laws on the 
        possession of firearms.
            (3) Military personnel, despite being extensively trained 
        in the proper and safe use of firearms, are therefore deprived 
        by the laws of the District of Columbia of handguns, rifles, 
        and shotguns that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons 
        throughout the United States for sporting use and for lawful 
        defense of their persons, homes, businesses, and families.
            (4) The District of Columbia has one of the highest per 
        capita murder rates in the Nation, which may be attributed in 
        part to previous local laws prohibiting possession of firearms 
        by law-abiding persons who would have otherwise been able to 
        defend themselves and their loved ones in their own homes and 
        businesses.
            (5) The Gun Control Act of 1968 (as amended by the Firearms 
        Owners' Protection Act) and the Brady Handgun Violence 
        Prevention Act provide comprehensive Federal regulations 
        applicable in the District of Columbia as elsewhere. In 
        addition, existing District of Columbia criminal laws punish 
        possession and illegal use of firearms by violent criminals and 
        felons. Consequently, there is no need for local laws that only 
        affect and disarm law-abiding citizens.
            (6) On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United 
        States in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller held that 
        the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess 
        a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, and thus ruled 
        that the District of Columbia's handgun ban and requirements 
        that rifles and shotguns in the home be kept unloaded and 
        disassembled or outfitted with a trigger lock to be 
        unconstitutional.
            (7) On July 16, 2008, the District of Columbia enacted the 
        Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 (D.C. Act 17-
        422; 55 DCR 8237), which places onerous restrictions on the 
        ability of law-abiding citizens from possessing firearms, thus 
        violating the spirit by which the Supreme Court of the United 
        States ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller.
            (8) On February 26, 2009, the United States Senate adopted 
        an amendment on a bipartisan vote of 62-36 by Senator John 
        Ensign to S. 160, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights 
        Act of 2009, which would fully restore Second Amendment rights 
        to the citizens of the District of Columbia.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that active 
duty military personnel who are stationed or residing in the District 
of Columbia should be permitted to exercise fully their rights under 
the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and 
therefore should be exempt from the District of Columbia's restrictions 
on the possession of firearms.

SEC. 1220. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Purpose.--Expressing the Sense of the House or Representatives 
that the Special Immigration Visa programs authorized in the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 and the Afghan Allies 
Protection Act of 2009 are critical to the United States national 
security, and that these programs must be reformed and extended in 
order to meet the Congressional intent with which they were created.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress created the Special Immigration Visa program 
        for the purposes of protecting and aiding the many brave Iraqis 
        and Afghans whose lives, and the lives of their families, were 
        endangered as a result of their faithful and valuable service 
        to the United States during Operations Enduring Freedom and 
        Iraqi Freedom.
            (2) The Iraq Special Immigrant Visa program is set to 
        expire at the end of fiscal year 2013.
            (3) The Afghanistan Special Immigrant Visa program is set 
        to expire at the end of fiscal year 2014.
            (4) Despite the pending expiration of the Special Immigrant 
        Visa programs, many brave Iraqis, Afghans, and their families, 
        continue to face ongoing and serious threats as a result of 
        their employment by or on behalf of the United States 
        Government.
            (5) Between FY08-FY12, only 22 percent of the available 
        Iraqi SIVs (5,500 visas out of 25,000 visas) have been issued 
        and 12 percent of the available Afghan SIVs (1,051 visas out of 
        8,500 visas) have been issued.
            (6) As the Washington Post reported in October 2012, over 
        5,000 documentarily complete Afghan SIV applications remained 
        in a backlog.
            (7) The implementation of the Special Immigration Visa 
        programs has been protracted and inefficient.
            (8) The application and approval process for the Special 
        Immigration Visa program is unnecessarily opaque and difficult 
        to navigate.
            (9) Applicants in both Iraq and Afghanistan often have 
        effusive recommendations from numerous military personnel, have 
        served the United States war efforts for many years, and have 
        served valiantly, in some instances literally taking a bullet 
        for a United States service member, and yet are denied approval 
        for a Special Immigration Visa with little to no transparency.
            (10) Overly narrow provisions contained in the Afghan 
        Allies Protection Act of 2009 leave many deserving Afghans and 
        their families in need of United States assistance, but unable 
        to access the Special Immigration Visa program.
            (11) The United States has a responsibility to follow 
        through on its promise to protect those Iraqis and Afghans who 
        have risked their lives to aid our troops and protect America's 
        security.
            (12) The extension and reform of the Iraq and Afghanistan 
        Special Immigrant Visa programs is a matter of national 
        security.
            (13) The extension and reform of the Afghan Special 
        Immigrant Visa program is essential to the United States 
        mission in Afghanistan.
    (c) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House of 
Representatives that the Iraq and Afghanistan Special Immigrant Visa 
programs should be--
            (1) reformed by--
                    (A) ensuring applications are processed in a 
                timely, and transparent fashion;
                    (B) providing parity between the two Special 
                Immigrant Visa programs so that Afghan principal 
                applicants, like Iraqi principal applicants, are able 
                to include their spouse, children, siblings, and 
                parents; and
                    (C) expanding eligibility for the Special Immigrant 
                Visa programs to Afghan or Iraqi men and women employed 
                by, or on behalf of, a media or nongovernmental 
                organization headquartered in the United States, or an 
                organization or entity closely associated with the 
                United States mission in Iraq or Afghanistan that has 
                received United States Government funding through an 
                official and documented contract, award, grant, or 
                cooperative agreement; and
            (2) extended in--
                    (A) Iraq through the year 2018, without authorizing 
                any additional Special Immigrant Visas as authorized in 
                the original statue; and
                    (B) Afghanistan through the year 2018, without 
                authorizing any additional Special Immigrant Visas as 
                authorized in the original statue.

        from Afghanistan;

SEC. 1233. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE DEFENSE OF THE ARABIAN GULF.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In response to U.S. Central Command requirements, the 
        United States Navy has maintained, on average, more than one 
        aircraft carrier in the Arabian Gulf for more than five years.
            (2) In February 2013, the senior leadership of the 
        Department of Defense elected to reduce the number of aircraft 
        carriers deployed to the Arabian Gulf in light of budget 
        constraints and limitation of the overall carrier force 
        structure to support the two aircraft carrier requirement.
            (3) In reference to the decision to indefinitely delay the 
        deployment of the USS Harry Truman, CVN 75, and the USS 
        Gettysburg, its cruiser escort, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, 
        General Martin Dempsey stated, ``We're trying to stretch our 
        readiness out by keeping this particular carrier in homeport in 
        our global response force, so if something happens elsewhere in 
        the world, we can respond to it. Had we deployed it and 
        `consumed' that readiness, we could have created a situation 
        where downstream we wouldn't have a carrier present in certain 
        parts of the world at all.''.
            (4) Highlighting the risks of having only one aircraft 
        carrier in the region and relying on land-based aircraft, 
        General Dempsey stated, ``When you have carrier-based aircraft, 
        you have complete autonomy and control over when you use them. 
        When you use land-based aircraft, you often have to have host-
        nation permission to use them.''.
            (5) Addressing the perception of the United States 
        commitment to the region, General James Mattis, Commander of 
        U.S. Central Command, testified in March 2013, ``Perhaps the 
        greatest risk to U.S. interests in the region is a perceived 
        lack of an enduring U.S. commitment to collective interests and 
        the security of our regional partners.''. He went on to testify 
        that, ``The drawdown of our forces can be misinterpreted as a 
        lack of attention, a lack of commitment to the region.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) maintaining only one aircraft carrier battle group in 
        the Arabian Gulf constrains United States' options and could 
        put at risk the ability to have diversified platforms from 
        which to defend the Arabian Gulf and, if necessary, to conduct 
        military operations to prevent Iran from threatening the United 
        States, United States allies, or Iran's neighbors with nuclear 
        weapons;
            (2) it is in the interests of the United States to maintain 
        both land-based and sea-based capabilities in the region to 
        project force;
            (3) land-based locations in the region could restrict 
        United States military options and critically impact the 
        operational capability if required to conduct a defense of the 
        Arabian Gulf because the United States has not finalized 
        bilateral security agreements with key Gulf Cooperation Council 
        countries;
            (4) as a result of these and other critical limitations 
        associated with maintaining one aircraft carrier battle group 
        in the Arabian Gulf, United States military commanders have 
        expressed concerns about the operational constraints, the 
        increasing uncertainty among United States allies, and the 
        emboldening of potential adversaries such as Iran;
            (5) regarding the ability of the United States Navy to 
        maintain a two aircraft carrier presence in the Arabian Gulf, 
        the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, 
        stated, ``We need 11 carriers to do the job. That's been pretty 
        clearly written, and that's underwritten in our defense 
        strategic guidance.''.
            (6) the United States should construct and sufficiently 
        sustain a fleet of at least eleven aircraft carriers and 
        associated battle force ships in order to meet current and 
        future requirements and to support at least a two aircraft 
        carrier battle group presence in the Arabian Gulf, in addition 
        to meeting other operational requirements; and
            (7) the United States should finalize bilateral agreements 
        with key Gulf Cooperation Council countries that support the 
        Defense of the Arabian Gulf requirements, at the earliest 
        possible date.

        undergraduate flying and tactical leadership'' and inserting 
        ``such''.

SEC. 1235. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN FOR 
              ITS STATE-SPONSORED PERSECUTION OF ITS BAHA'I MINORITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2000, 
        2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013, Congress declared that it 
        deplored the religious persecution by the Government of Iran of 
        the Baha'i community and would hold the Government of Iran 
        responsible for upholding the rights of all Iranian nationals, 
        including members of the Baha'i faith.
            (2) The United States Commission on International Religious 
        Freedom 2012 Report stated, ``The Baha'i community has long 
        been subject to particularly severe religious freedom 
        violations in Iran. Baha'is, who number at least 300,000, are 
        viewed as `heretics' by Iranian authorities and may face 
        repression on the grounds of apostasy.''.
            (3) The United States Commission on International Religious 
        Freedom 2012 Report stated, ``Since 1979, Iranian government 
        authorities have killed more than 200 Baha'i leaders in Iran 
        and dismissed more than 10,000 from government and university 
        jobs.''.
            (4) The United States Commission on International Religious 
        Freedom 2012 Report stated, ``Baha'is may not establish places 
        of worship, schools, or any independent religious associations 
        in Iran.''.
            (5) The United States Commission on International Religious 
        Freedom 2012 Report stated, ``Baha'is are barred from the 
        military and denied government jobs and pensions as well as the 
        right to inherit property. Their marriages and divorces also 
        are not recognized, and they have difficulty obtaining death 
        certificates. Baha'i cemeteries, holy places, and community 
        properties are often seized or desecrated, and many important 
        religious sites have been destroyed.''.
            (6) The United States Commission on International Religious 
        Freedom 2012 Report stated, ``The Baha'i community faces severe 
        economic pressure, including denials of jobs in both the public 
        and private sectors and of business licenses. Iranian 
        authorities often pressure employers of Baha'is to dismiss them 
        from employment in the private sector.''.
            (7) The Department of State 2011 International Religious 
        Freedom Report stated, ``The government prohibits Baha'is from 
        teaching and practicing their faith and subjects them to many 
        forms of discrimination that followers of other religions do 
        not face.''.
            (8) The Department of State 2011 International Religious 
        Freedom Report stated, ``According to law, Baha'i blood is 
        considered `mobah', meaning it can be spilled with impunity.''.
            (9) The Department of State 2011 International Religious 
        Freedom Report stated that ``members of religious minorities, 
        with the exception of Baha'is, can serve in lower ranks of 
        government employment'', and ``Baha'is are barred from all 
        leadership positions in the government and military''.
            (10) The Department of State 2011 International Religious 
        Freedom Report stated, ``Baha'is suffered frequent government 
        harassment and persecution, and their property rights generally 
        were disregarded. The government raided Baha'i homes and 
        businesses and confiscated large amounts of private and 
        commercial property, as well as religious materials belonging 
        to Baha'is.''.
            (11) The Department of State 2011 International Religious 
        Freedom Report stated, ``Baha'is also are required to register 
        with the police''.
            (12) The Department of State 2011 International Religious 
        Freedom Report stated that ``[p]ublic and private universities 
        continued to deny admittance to and expelled Baha'i students'' 
        and ``[d]uring the year, at least 30 Baha'is were barred or 
        expelled from universities on political or religious grounds''.
            (13) The Department of State 2011 International Religious 
        Freedom Report stated, ``Baha'is are regularly denied 
        compensation for injury or criminal victimization.''.
            (14) On March 6, 2012, the United Nations Special 
        Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran issued a report (A/HRC/19/66), which stated 
        that ``the Special Rapporteur continues to be alarmed by 
        communications that demonstrate the systemic and systematic 
        persecution of members of unrecognized religious communities, 
        particularly the Baha'i community, in violation of 
        international conventions'' and expressed concern regarding 
        ``an intensive defamation campaign meant to incite 
        discrimination and hate against Baha'is''.
            (15) On May 23, 2012, the United Nations Secretary-General 
        issued a report, which stated that ``the Special Rapporteur on 
        freedom of religion or belief * * * pointed out that the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran had a policy of systematic persecution 
        of persons belonging to the Baha'i faith, excluding them from 
        the application of freedom of religion or belief by simply 
        denying that their faith had the status of a religion''.
            (16) On August 22, 2012, the United Nations Secretary-
        General issued a report, which stated, ``The international 
        community continues to express concerns about the very serious 
        discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities in law 
        and in practice, in particular the Baha'i community. The 
        Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran expressed alarm about the systemic and 
        systematic persecution of members of the Baha'i community, 
        including severe socioeconomic pressure and arrests and 
        detention. He also deplored the Government's tolerance of an 
        intensive defamation campaign aimed at inciting discrimination 
        and hate against Baha'is.''.
            (17) On September 13, 2012, the United Nations Special 
        Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran issued a report (A/67/369), which stated, 
        ``Reports and interviews submitted to the Special Rapporteur 
        also continue to portray a disturbing trend with regard to 
        religious freedom in the country. Members of both recognized 
        and unrecognized religions have reported various levels of 
        intimidation, arrest, detention and interrogation that focus on 
        their religious beliefs.'', and stated, ``At the time of 
        drafting the report, 105 members of the Baha'i community were 
        reported to be in detention.''.
            (18) On November 27, 2012, the Third Committee of the 
        United Nations General Assembly adopted a draft resolution (A/
        C.3/67/L.51), which noted, ``[I]ncreased persecution and human 
        rights violations against persons belonging to unrecognized 
        religious minorities, particularly members of the Baha'i faith 
        and their defenders, including escalating attacks, an increase 
        in the number of arrests and detentions, the restriction of 
        access to higher education on the basis of religion, the 
        sentencing of twelve Baha'is associated with Baha'i educational 
        institutions to lengthy prison terms, the continued denial of 
        access to employment in the public sector, additional 
        restrictions on participation in the private sector, and the de 
        facto criminalization of membership in the Baha'i faith.''.
            (19) On December 20, 2012, the United Nations General 
        Assembly adopted a resolution (A/RES/67/182), which called upon 
        the government of Iran ``[t]o eliminate discrimination against, 
        and exclusion of * * * members of the Baha'i Faith, regarding 
        access to higher education, and to eliminate the 
        criminalization of efforts to provide higher education to 
        Baha'i youth denied access to Iranian universities,'' and ``to 
        accord all Baha'is, including those imprisoned because of their 
        beliefs, the due process of law and the rights that they are 
        constitutionally guaranteed''.
            (20) On February 28, 2013, the United Nations Special 
        Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran issued a report (A/HRC/22/56), which stated, 
        ``110 Bahai's are currently detained in Iran for exercising 
        their faith, including two women, Mrs. Zohreh Nikayin and Mrs. 
        Taraneh Torabi, who are reportedly nursing infants in prison''.
            (21) In March and May of 2008, intelligence officials of 
        the Government of Iran in Mashhad and Tehran arrested and 
        imprisoned Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. 
        Afif Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, Mrs. 
        Mahvash Sabet, and Mr. Vahid Tizfahm, the seven members of the 
        ad hoc leadership group for the Baha'i community in Iran.
            (22) In August 2010, the Revolutionary Court in Tehran 
        sentenced the seven Baha'i leaders to 20-year prison terms on 
        charges of ``spying for Israel, insulting religious sanctities, 
        propaganda against the regime and spreading corruption on 
        earth''.
            (23) The lawyer for these seven leaders, Mrs. Shirin Ebadi, 
        the Nobel Laureate, was denied meaningful or timely access to 
        the prisoners and their files, and her successors as defense 
        counsel were provided extremely limited access.
            (24) These seven Baha'i leaders were targeted solely on the 
        basis of their religion.
            (25) Beginning in May 2011, Government of Iran officials in 
        four cities conducted sweeping raids on the homes of dozens of 
        individuals associated with the Baha'i Institute for Higher 
        Education (BIHE) and arrested and detained several educators 
        associated with BIHE.
            (26) In October 2011, the Revolutionary Court in Tehran 
        sentenced seven of these BIHE instructors and administrators, 
        Mr. Vahid Mahmoudi, Mr. Kamran Mortezaie, Mr. Mahmoud Badavam, 
        Ms. Nooshin Khadem, Mr. Farhad Sedghi, Mr. Riaz Sobhani, and 
        Mr. Ramin Zibaie, to prison terms for the crime of ``membership 
        of the deviant sect of Baha'ism, with the goal of taking action 
        against the security of the country, in order to further the 
        aims of the deviant sect and those of organizations outside the 
        country''.
            (27) Six of these educators remain imprisoned, with Mr. 
        Mortezaie serving a 5-year prison term and Mr. Badavam, Ms. 
        Khadem, Mr. Sedghi, Mr. Sobhani, and Mr. Zibaie serving 4-year 
        prison terms.
            (28) Since October 2011, four other BIHE educators, Ms. 
        Faran Hessami, Mr. Kamran Rahimian, Mr. Kayvan Rahimian, and 
        Mr. Shahin Negari have been sentenced to 4-year prison terms, 
        which they are now serving.
            (29) The efforts of the Government of Iran to collect 
        information on individual Baha'is have recently intensified as 
        evidenced by a letter, dated November 5, 2011, from the 
        Director of the Department of Education in the county of 
        Shahriar in the province of Tehran, instructing the directors 
        of schools in his jurisdiction to ``subtly and in a 
        confidential manner'' collect information on Baha'i students.
            (30) The Baha'i community continues to undergo intense 
        economic and social pressure, including an ongoing campaign in 
        the town of Semnan, where the Government of Iran has harassed 
        and detained Baha'is, closed 17 Baha'i owned businesses in the 
        last three years, and imprisoned several members of the 
        community, including three mothers along with their infants.
            (31) Ordinary Iranian citizens who belong to the Baha'i 
        faith are disproportionately targeted, interrogated, and 
        detained under the pretext of national security.
            (32) The Government of Iran is party to the International 
        Covenants on Human Rights and is in violation of its 
        obligations under the Covenants.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--Congress--
            (1) condemns the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored 
        persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued violation 
        of the International Covenants on Human Rights;
            (2) calls on the Government of Iran to immediately release 
        the seven imprisoned leaders, the ten imprisoned educators, and 
        all other prisoners held solely on account of their religion; 
        and
            (3) calls on the President and Secretary of State, in 
        cooperation with responsible nations, to immediately condemn 
        the Government of Iran's continued violation of human rights 
        and demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on 
        account of their religion.

                 Subtitle E--Reports and Other Matters

SEC. 1241. REPORT ON POSTURE AND READINESS OF UNITED STATES ARMED 
              FORCES TO RESPOND TO FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN AFRICA 
              AND THE MIDDLE EAST.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya on September 
        11, 2012, may have never occurred or could have been prevented 
        had there been an international stabilizing force following 
        NATO-led operations in order to help stabilize the country, 
        build capacity within the security forces, and pursue terrorist 
        groups that threaten the local government as well as United 
        States interests;
            (2) the attack also highlighted the limitations of the 
        United States military to alert, deploy, and decisively counter 
        a no-notice terrorist attack such as the one in Benghazi, or 
        another security contingency, due to the limitations stemming 
        from United States military posture in Africa and the Middle 
        East and when there is a lack of a layered defense at United 
        States diplomatic facilities;
            (3) the United States military is more effectively able to 
        respond to terrorist attacks on United States facilities 
        outside of the United States if the responding United States 
        military assets are forward deployed;
            (4) when an intelligence threat assessment determines that 
        a United States facility overseas is vulnerable to attack, such 
        facility should have robust force protection measures 
        sufficient to safeguard personnel and assets until a United 
        States military response can arrive;
            (5) the continually evolving terrorist threat to United 
        States interests on the Continent of Africa and the Middle East 
        necessitates that the United States military maintains a 
        forward deployed posture in Europe, Middle East, and Africa in 
        order to be able to respond to terrorist events, or other 
        security contingencies, and to effectively evacuate and recover 
        United States personnel;
            (6) the United States military, in conjunction with the 
        Department of State and the intelligence community, should 
        continue to evaluate the assumptions underpinning the terrorist 
        threat in order to ensure that it is effectively able to 
        respond globally to future terrorist attacks;
            (7) the United States military should regularly re-evaluate 
        the posture and alert status requirements of its crisis 
        response elements in order to be more responsive to the 
        evolving and global nature of the terrorist threat, and all 
        United States military crisis response elements should be fully 
        equipped with the required supporting capabilities to conduct 
        their missions;
            (8) on April 16, 2013, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
        Staff, General Martin Dempsey, testified before the House 
        Appropriations Committee that the military is, ``* * * adapting 
        our force posture to a new normal of combustible violence in 
        North Africa and in the Middle East'';
            (9) The President stated in a press conference on May 16, 
        2013, ``I have directed the Defense Department to ensure that 
        our military can respond lightening quick in times of 
        crisis.'';
            (10) the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs should continue to 
        evaluate the posture of United States forces to respond to the 
        global terrorist threat, including an evaluation of whether 
        United States Africa Command should have forces and necessary 
        equipment permanently assigned to the command to respond more 
        promptly to this ``new normal''; and
            (11) although the Department of State-initiated 
        Accountability Review Board found that the Marine Security 
        Guard program should be expanded and that there should be 
        greater coordination between the Department of Defense and the 
        Department of State to identify additional resources for 
        security at high risk posts, the United States military may be 
        challenged to provide additional security to Department of 
        State facilities due to budget shortfalls, on-going force 
        structure constraints, and increasing operational requirements 
        for the Department of Defense.
    (b) Report Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in 
        consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
        shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
        report on the posture and readiness of United States Armed 
        Forces to respond to future terrorist attacks in Africa and the 
        Middle East.
            (2) Matters to be included.--The plan required under 
        paragraph (1) shall include, at a minimum, the following:
                    (A) An assessment of terrorist groups and other 
                non-state groups that threaten United States interests 
                and facilities in Africa, including a description of 
                the key assumptions underpinning such assessment.
                    (B) A description of the readiness, posture, and 
                alert status of relevant United States Armed Forces in 
                Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the United States 
                and any changes implemented or planned to be 
                implemented since the terrorist attack in Benghazi, 
                Libya on September 11, 2012, to respond to the ``new 
                normal'' and President Obama's directive for the 
                military to respond ``lightening quick'' in times of 
                crisis.
                    (C) In consultation with the Secretary of State, a 
                description of new or modified requirements of the 
                Department of State, if any, for--
                            (i) United States Marine Security Guard 
                        Detachments;
                            (ii) any other Department of Defense assets 
                        to provide enhanced security at Department of 
                        State facilities;
                            (iii) an explanation of how any new 
                        requirements for Marine Security Detachments or 
                        other Department of Defense assets affect the 
                        capacity of the Armed Forces, including 
                        specifically the capacity of the Marine Corps, 
                        to fulfill Department of Defense operational 
                        requirements; and
                            (iv) an explanation of how any unfulfilled 
                        requirements for Marine Security Detachments 
                        would adversely impact security at Department 
                        of State facilities.
            (3) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``appropriate 
        congressional committees'' means--
                    (A) the Committee on Armed Services and the 
                Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and
                    (B) the Committee on Armed Services and the 
                Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
                Representatives.

SEC. 1242. ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF EGYPT TO UNITED STATES NATIONAL 
              SECURITY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Egypt is undergoing a significant political transition 
        and the ultimate outcome of this political process and its 
        implications for United States national security interests 
        remain uncertain;
            (2) the United States continues to have considerable 
        concerns about the intentions and actions of the Egyptian 
        Muslim Brotherhood and whether the government of President 
        Morsi is committed to a pluralistic, democratic Egypt;
            (3) the United States has a stake in Egypt becoming a 
        mature, pluralistic democracy in which the rights of Egyptian 
        citizens, including women and minorities, are protected;
            (4) the United States should continue to closely monitor 
        President Morsi's support for the peace treaty with the 
        Government of Israel, which has been a stabilizing force in the 
        region for over 30 years;
            (5) the United States military relationship with the 
        Egyptian military is long-standing and should remain a key 
        pillar to, and component of, United States engagement with 
        Egypt;
            (6) the close military-to-military relationship between the 
        United States and Egypt has been a critical component in 
        enabling counterterrorism cooperation between the two 
        governments to ensure the United States military has freedom of 
        movement throughout the region in order to deter aggression and 
        respond to threats to United States national security 
        interests, particularly in light of the security situation in 
        Libya and the Sinai;
            (7) the Egyptian military has exercised restraint and 
        professionalism during the unrest in Egypt over the last two 
        years and hopefully will remain a key mechanism through which 
        the United States can support the people of Egypt in achieving 
        their goals for a representative and democratic political 
        system, while promoting peace and security in the region; and
            (8) therefore, with appropriate vetting, United States 
        military assistance and support to the Egyptian military should 
        continue, even as civilian aid to Egypt receives greater 
        scrutiny as a result of the uncertainty associated with Egypt's 
        current political leadership and economic policies.
    (b) Plan Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a report that contains a 
        comprehensive plan for United States military assistance and 
        cooperation with Egypt.
            (2) Matters to be included.--The plan required under 
        paragraph (1) shall include, at a minimum, a detailed 
        description of the following:
                    (A) How United States security assistance and

SEC. 1243. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS ON THE KOREAN 
              PENINSULA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (``North 
        Korea'') has escalated regional tensions with hostile rhetoric 
        and provocative actions.
            (2) North Korea threatened a nuclear attack on the United 
        States and a resumption of open war against the Republic of 
        Korea (``South Korea'').
            (3) North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile 
        programs constitute a threat to the national security of the 
        United States and to regional stability.
            (4) On April 14, 2009, North Korea halted negotiations 
        regarding its nuclear weapons program when it abandoned the 
        Six-Party Talks with the People's Republic of China 
        (``China''), Japan, the Russian Federation (``Russia''), South 
        Korea, and the United States.
            (5) On May 25, 2009, North Korea detonated a nuclear device 
        in an underground explosive test.
            (6) On March 26, 2010, North Korea sank a South Korean 
        naval vessel, the Cheonan, killing 46 South Korean sailors.
            (7) On November 23, 2010, North Korea shelled the border 
        island of Yeonpyeong-do, killing four people. This was the 
        first direct artillery attack on South Korean territory since 
        the signing of the 1953 armistice.
            (8) On April 13, 2012, North Korea conducted a rocket 
        launch that failed to send a satellite into orbit. This launch 
        violated United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions 
        1718 and 1874.
            (9) On December 12, 2012, North Korea used banned long-
        range missile technology to launch an earth observation 
        satellite into orbit. In response, the UNSC unanimously adopted 
        Resolution 2087, condemning the launch.
            (10) On February 12, 2013, North Korea conducted a third 
        underground nuclear test in violation of UNSC Resolution 1718, 
        1874, and 2087. The test also contravened North Korea's 
        commitments under the September 2005 Joint Statement of the 
        Six-Party Talks.
            (11) On March 7, 2013, the UNSC unanimously adopted 
        Resolution 2094, condemning North Korea's third nuclear test 
        and imposed additional sanctions against the regime.
            (12) On March 28, 2013, North Korea unilaterally nullified 
        the armistice agreement with the United States that suspended 
        military conflict on the Korean peninsula.
            (13) On March 30, 2013, North Korea declared a state of war 
        with South Korea.
            (14) On April 4, 2013, North Korea placed two intermediate-
        range Musudan missiles on mobile launchers and temporarily 
        relocated them to the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula 
        before removing them a month later from the launch sites.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States and its allies, South Korea and 
        Japan, share the goal of a stable and peaceful Korean 
        Peninsula, free of nuclear weapons;
            (2) the United States remains committed to defending its 
        allies in the Asia-Pacific region and stability in Northeast 
        Asia requires restraint by all parties from activities that 
        would complicate international relations or escalate 
        international tensions, and international disputes should be 
        mitigated in a constructive manner consistent with established 
        principles of international law;
            (3) Congress supports--
                    (A) the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean 
                Peninsula in a peaceful manner,
                    (B) North Korea's abandonment of its nuclear 
                programs and return to the Treaty on the 
                Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to 
                International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards; and
                    (C) North Korea's full acceptance of and compliance 
                with the terms of the 1953 Armistice Agreement;
            (4) the United States has national interests in security 
        and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the implementation of 
        the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, nuclear non-
        proliferation efforts, the promotion of respect for the 
        fundamental human rights of the North Korean people, 
        international cyber-security cooperation, and full 
        implementation of United States and multilateral sanctions 
        against illicit activities;
            (5) the United States encourages China and Russia to fully 
        implement and enforce United States and United Nations Security 
        Council sanctions against North Korea; and
            (6) the President, the Secretary of State, and the 
        Secretary of Defense should keep Congress fully informed on 
        security developments on the Korean Peninsula.

SEC. 1244. STATEMENT OF CONGRESS ON DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH GEORGIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Republic of Georgia is a highly valued ally of the 
        United States and has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to 
        advancing the mutual interests of both countries, including the 
        deployment of Georgian forces as part of the NATO-led 
        International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and the 
        Multi-National Force in Iraq.
            (2) The peaceful transfer of power as the result of the 
        free and fair parliamentary elections in Georgia in October 
        2012 represents a major accomplishment toward the Georgian 
        people's creation of a free society and full democracy.
            (3) However, since the October 2012 parliamentary elections 
        the new Georgian Government has taken a series of measures 
        against former officials and members of the current political 
        opposition that appear to be motivated by political 
        considerations.
            (4) Over 100 former Georgian Government officials have been 
        charged with criminal violations since the October 2012 
        parliamentary elections.
            (5) Similar charges have been filed against members of the 
        political opposition, including Vano Merabishvili, the 
        Secretary General of the United National Movement.
            (6) The arrest of the leader of an opposition party is 
        especially troubling, particularly its chilling effect on 
        political freedom prior to the presidential election scheduled 
        for October 2013.
            (7) The Georgian Government has taken insufficient action 
        to prevent further violence against members of the United 
        National Movement and to punish offenders.
            (8) These actions call into question the Georgian 
        Government's continued progress toward the creation of a free 
        and democratic society in which basic freedoms, including 
        freedom for political opposition, are guaranteed.
    (b) Statement of Congress.--Congress declares that--
            (1) the United States remains committed to assisting the 
        people of Georgia in establishing a free and democratic society 
        in their country;
            (2) the measures taken by the Georgian Government against 
        former officials and political opponents, apparently in part 
        motivated by political considerations, may have a significant 
        negative impact on cooperation between the United States and 
        Georgia, including efforts to build a stronger relationship in 
        political, economic, and security matters, as well as progress 
        on integrating Georgia into international organizations;
            (3) the United States must be unambiguous when democratic 
        backsliding occurs in a key ally after a peaceful and 
        democratic transfer of power between political parties; and
            (4) the people of the United States and the Members of 
        Congress express their deepest condolences to the Georgian 
        people on the tragic loss of seven soldiers of Georgia in a 
        suicide bombing on June 6, 2013, and the deaths of three 
        soldiers killed in another suicide bombing on May 13, 2013, 
        while they were supporting United States and NATO forces in 
        Afghanistan.

SEC. 1251. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The conflict in Syria began in March 2011.
            (2) As of February 2013, the United Nations High 
        Commissioner for Human Rights estimated that approximately 
        70,000 Syrians have been killed during the conflict.
            (3) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
        Refugees, over 1,200,000 Syrians are registered refugees or 
        persons of concern including, over 66,000 in Egypt, over 
        145,000 in Iraq, over 461,000 in Jordan, over 462,000 in 
        Lebanon, and over 329,000 in Turkey.
            (4) Jabhat al-Nusra, a group located in Syria and 
        categorized as an affiliate of al-Qaeda by the intelligence 
        community, presents a direct threat to the interests of the 
        United States and could present a direct threat to the United 
        States.
            (5) On August 19, 2011, President Obama stated: ``The 
        future of Syria must be determined by its people, but President 
        Bashar al-Assad is standing in their way. We have consistently 
        said that President Assad must lead a democratic transition or 
        get out of the way. He has not led. For the sake of the Syrian 
        people, the time has come for President Assad to step aside.''.
            (6) The United States is deploying 200 military personnel 
        from the headquarters of the 1st Armored Division to Jordan in 
        order to ``improve readiness and prepare for a number of 
        scenarios''.
            (7) In a letter from Miguel Rodriguez, the Assistant to the 
        President for Legislative Affairs, to Senators McCain and 
        Levin, dated April 25, 2013, it stated that ``our intelligence 
        community does assess with varying degrees of confidence that 
        the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in 
        Syria, specifically, the chemical agent sarin * * * We do 
        believe that any use of chemical weapons in Syria would very 
        likely have originated with the Assad regime * * * the 
        President has made it clear that the use of chemical weapons--
        or the transfer of chemical weapons to terrorist groups--is a 
        red line for the United States of America''.
            (8) In a press conference with Israel Prime Minister, 
        Benjamin Netanyahu, President Obama stated: ``I have made clear 
        that the use of chemical weapons is a game-changer''.
            (9) In August 2012, during a White House press conference, 
        President Obama stated: ``We have been very clear to the Assad 
        regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a redline 
        for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons 
        moving around or being utilized.''.
            (10) It is a threat to the vital national security interest 
        of the United States if terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda, 
        obtain chemical or biological material or weapons in Syria.
            (11) At a Pentagon press conference on May 2, 2013, 
        Secretary Hagel confirmed that the Obama Administration is re-
        thinking its opposition to arming the rebels.
            (12) On April 11, 2013, responding to a question about the 
        need for a supplemental funding request for any potential 
        United States military effort in Syria, Secretary Hagel stated: 
        ``Yes, I think it is pretty clear that a supplemental would be 
        required.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) President Obama should have a comprehensive policy and 
        should ensure robust contingency planning to secure United 
        States' interests in Syria;
            (2) President Obama should fully consider all courses of 
        action to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power;
            (3) the conflict in Syria threatens the vital national 
        security interests of Israel and the stability of Jordan, 
        Lebanon, and Turkey, the implications of which should be 
        sufficiently weighed by the President when considering policy 
        approaches towards the conflict in Syria;
            (4) the sale or transfer of advanced anti-aircraft weapons 
        systems to Syria poses a grave risk to Israel and the United 
        States supports Israel's right to respond to this grave threat 
        as needed;
            (5) the President should fully consider all courses of 
        action to reinforce his stated ``redline'' regarding the use of 
        weapons of mass destruction by the Assad regime in Syria, which 
        could threaten the credibility of the United States with its 
        allies in the region and embolden the Assad regime;
            (6) the United States should continue to conduct rigorous 
        planning and operational preparation to support any efforts to 
        secure the chemical and biological stockpiles and associated 
        weapons;
            (7) the United States should have a policy that supports 
        the stability of countries on Syria's border, including Jordan, 
        Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, and Israel;
            (8) the United States should continue to support Syrian 
        opposition forces with non-lethal aid;
            (9) the President, the Department of Defense, the 
        Department of State, and the intelligence community, in 
        cooperation with European and regional allies, should ensure 
        that the risks of all courses of action or inaction regarding 
        Syria are fully explored and understood and that Congress is 
        kept fully informed of such risks;
            (10) the President should fully consider, and the 
        Department of Defense should conduct prudent planning for, the 
        provision of lethal aid and relevant operational training to 
        vetted Syrian opposition forces, including an analysis of the 
        risks of the provision of such aid and training;
            (11) should the President decide to employ any military 
        assets in Syria, the President should provide a supplemental 
        budget request to Congress; and
            (12) the President should use all diplomatic means to 
        disrupt the flow of arms into Syria, including efforts to 
        dissuade Russia from further arms sales with Syria, the influx 
        of weapons and fighters from Hezbollah, and the infiltration of 
        weapons and fighters from Iran.

the Constitution or unless authorized by the enactment of further 
affirmative legislation by the Congress of the United States.''.
    (b) Limitation on Funds.--None of the funds authorized to be 
appropriated or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2014 or any 
fiscal year thereafter for the Department of Defense may be used--
            (1) to implement any executive agreement relating to the 
        missile defense capabilities of the United States, including 
        basing, locations, capabilities, and numbers of missiles with 
        respect to such missile defense capabilities; or

    (a) In General.--None of the funds made available for fiscal year 
2014 for Threat Reduction Engagement activities may be obligated or

inconsistent with United States interpretations regarding obligations 
under such Treaty.
    (b) Lobbying or Advocacy Activities.--None of the funds made

SEC. 1255. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MILITARY-TO-MILITARY COOPERATION 
              BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND BURMA.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) as the United States policy rebalances towards Asia, it 
        is critical that the United States military comprehensively 
        evaluate its engagement with Burma;
            (2) the future of the military-to-military relationship 
        between the United States and Burma should take into account 
        the current ethnic conflict in Burma and persecution of ethnic 
        and religious minorities;
            (3) while the United States has national security interests 
        in Burma's peace and stability, the peaceful settlement of 
        armed conflicts with the ethnic minority groups requires the 
        Burmese military to respect ceasefire agreements, laws of war, 
        and human rights provisions; and
            (4) the Department of Defense should fully consider and 
        assess the Burmese military's efforts to implement reforms, end 
        impunity for human rights abuses, and increase transparency and 
        accountability before expanding military-to-military 
        cooperation beyond initial dialogue and isolated engagements.

SEC. 1256. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE STATIONING OF UNITED STATES FORCES 
              IN EUROPE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) During the past several years, over 700 kinetic terror 
        incidents have occurred in the U.S. European Command (EUCOM) 
        area of operations. Rising tensions in the region due to 
        unemployment, fiscal insolvency, ethnic strife, hegemonic 
        desires, and terrorism, pose risks to the security and 
        stability of Europe.
            (2) Arab Spring uprisings in Middle Eastern and North 
        African countries, including the Republic of Mali, the Arab 
        Republic of Egypt, Libya, and the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria), 
        have presented emerging strategic challenges that present 
        significant implications for regional stability, the security 
        of the State of Israel (Israel), and the national security 
        interests of the United States and many European allies.
            (3) U.S. Africa Command does not have formally assigned 
        Army or Marine Corps units assigned to it and it continues to 
        share Air Force and Navy component commands with EUCOM. 
        Consequently, United States forces stationed in Europe have 
        been deployed to support contingencies associated with the Arab 
        Spring in North Africa.
            (4) The Commander of U.S. European Command is responsible 
        for developing operational plans for the defense of Israel. 
        Moreover, forces stationed in Europe would be deployed to 
        defend Israel in the event of such a contingency.
            (5) Regimes, including the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
        Syria, continue efforts to procure, develop, and proliferate 
        advanced ballistic missile technologies that pose a serious 
        threat to United States forces and installations in the 
        theater, as well as to the territory, populations, and forces 
        of Israel and European allies. United States missile defense 
        capabilities in Europe seek to mitigate these threats.
            (6) Violent extremist organizations, including Kongra-Gel, 
        al Qaida, Lebanese Hizballah, and Iranian Qods Force, may 
        utilize Europe as an important venue for recruitment, 
        logistical support, financing, and the targeting of the United 
        States and Western interests.
            (7) Congress has lacked sufficient data to compare the 
        strategic benefits and the costs associated with permanently 
        stationing forces in Europe. The Government Accountability 
        Office (GAO) has found that the combatant commands do not 
        completely and consistently report cost data in their theater 
        posture plans. In particular, GAO reported in February 2011 
        that EUCOM lacks comprehensive cost data in its theater posture 
        plans and therefore decision makers lack critical information 
        that could be used to make fully informed posture decisions. 
        Additionally, in June 2012, GAO found that the Department of 
        Defense has taken steps to align posture initiatives with 
        strategy and cost, but continues to lack comprehensive and 
        consistent cost estimates of initiatives.
            (8) The Department of Defense has reported that the cost of 
        permanently stationing forces in the United States rather than 
        overseas is often offset by such factors as increased 
        rotational costs.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) an enduring United States presence and engagement 
        across Europe and Eurasia provides the critical access and 
        infrastructure necessary to accomplish United States strategic 
        priorities, expand United States global reach to Europe, 
        Eurasia, the Middle East, Africa, as well as the Mediterranean 
        and Atlantic Oceans, and facilitates a rapid United States 
        response for complex contingencies;
            (2) the United States continues to have an interest in 
        supporting the stability and security of Europe, especially in 
        a dynamic and challenging global security environment;
            (3) forward-stationed active duty service members, forward-
        deployed rotational units, and reserve forces assigned to U.S. 
        European Command remain essential for United States planning, 
        logistics, and operations in support of U.S. Central Command, 
        U.S. Africa Command, U.S. Transportation Command, U.S. Special 
        Operations Command, and U.S. Strategic Command, as well as 
        fulfilling commitments under Article V of the North Atlantic 
        Charter;
            (4) in light of the benefits associated with defense of the 
        homeland forward and strategic access, as well as the potential 
        for rotational deployments to increase cost to the Department 
        of Defense, the Department of Defense should implement the 
        recommendations of the Government Accountability Office with 
        regard to improved cost estimation to enable informed force 
        posture decisions prior to making any further significant 
        changes to the United States force posture in Europe that could 
        increase risk for the United States; and
            (5) the Secretary of Defense should keep Congress fully and 
        currently informed regarding the requirements of the United 
        States force posture in Europe and the costs associated with 
        maintaining such force.

SEC. 1257. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MILITARY CAPABILITIES OF THE PEOPLE'S 
              REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

    Congress--
            (1) notes the People's Republic of China (PRC) continues to 
        rapidly modernize and expand its military capabilities across 
        the land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace domains;
            (2) is concerned by the rate and scope of PRC military 
        developments, including its military-focused cyber espionage, 
        which indicate a desire to constrain or prevent the peaceful 
        activities of the United States and its allies in the Western 
        Pacific;
            (3) concurs with Admiral Samuel Locklear, commander of U.S. 
        Pacific Command, that ``China's rapid development of advanced 
        military capabilities, combined with its unclear intentions, 
        certainly raises strategic and security concerns for the U.S. 
        and the region'';
            (4) notes the United States remains committed to a robust 
        forward military-presence in the Asia-Pacific and will continue 
        to vigorously support mutual defense arrangements with treaty 
        allies while also building deeper relationships with other 
        strategic partners in the region; and
            (5) urges the Government of the PRC to work peacefully to 
        resolve existing territorial disputes and to adopt a maritime 
        code of conduct with relevant parties to guide all forms of 
        maritime interaction and communications in the Asia-Pacific.

SEC. 1258. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the use of 
force against Syria or Iran.

SEC. 1259. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that the United States should--
            (1) allow all high-level officials of Taiwan to enter into 
        the United States or its embassies and consulates under 
        conditions which demonstrate appropriate respect for the 
        dignity of such leaders;
            (2) allow meetings between all high-level Taiwan and United 
        States officials in United States executive departments;
            (3) allow the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative 
        Office and all other instrumentalities established in the 
        United States by Taiwan to conduct business activities, 
        including activities which involve participation by Members of 
        Congress and other representatives of Federal, State, and local 
        governments, and all high-level Taiwan officials, without 
        obstruction from the United States Government or any foreign 
        power; and
            (4) adopt a policy of allowing high-ranking Taiwan leaders 
        to make official visits with high-ranking officials of the 
        United States, including official visits by Taiwan's 
        democratically elected president, and allowing for visits 
        between these officials in Washington, D.C.

SEC. 1260. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE THREAT POSED BY HEZBOLLAH.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Hezbollah has been designated a foreign terrorist 
        organization by the Department of State since October 8, 1997.
            (2) Hezbollah has been responsible for numerous terrorist 
        attacks and attempted terrorist attacks around the world, 
        including attacks against United States citizens.
            (3) Hezbollah is active in Europe and has been linked to a 
        July 18, 2012, suicide bombing in Bulgaria which killed five 
        people.
            (4) Hezbollah operatives have been captured around the 
        world attacking or attempting to attack Western and Israeli 
        targets.
            (5) The United States is working with its European allies 
        to combat terrorism through a variety of means, including 
        through NATO's Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism and 
        the Defence Against Terrorism Programme of Work.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should continue to use all necessary 
        means to fight against terrorism, including Hezbollah;
            (2) President Obama should strongly encourage his European 
        counterparts to publicly condemn Hezbollah;
            (3) European allies should seek to officially recognize 
        Hezbollah as a terrorist organization;
            (4) any attempt to distinguish between military and 
        civilian wings in Hezbollah is meaningless; and
            (5) all countries should work together to fight radical 
        terrorist organizations like Hezbollah.

SEC. 1261. COMBATING CRIME THROUGH INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES.

    The Secretary of Defense is authorized to deploy assets, personnel, 
and resources to the Joint Interagency Task Force South, in 
coordination with SOUTHCOM, to combat the following by supplying

SEC. 1262. LIMITATION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT THE ARMS 
              TRADE TREATY.

    None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or 
otherwise made available for fiscal year 2014 or any fiscal year 
thereafter for the Department of Defense may be obligated or expended 
to implement the Arms Trade Treaty, or to make any change to existing 
programs, projects, or activities as approved by Congress in 
furtherance of, pursuant to, or otherwise to implement the Arms Trade 
Treaty, unless the Arms Trade Treaty has been signed by the President, 
received the advice and consent of the Senate, and has been the subject 
of implementing legislation by the Congress.

SEC. 1263. WAR POWERS OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1793, George Washington said, ``The constitution 
        vests the power of declaring war in Congress; therefore no 
        offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until 
        after they shall have deliberated upon the subject and 
        authorized such a measure.''.
            (2) In a letter to Thomas Jefferson in 1798, James Madison 
        wrote: ``The constitution supposes, what the History of all 
        Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of 
        power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has 
        accordingly with studied care vested the question of war to the 
        Legislature.''
            (3) In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution 
        which states in section 2: ``The constitutional powers of the 
        President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States 
        Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where 
        imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the 
        circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration 
        of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) national 
        emergency created by attack upon the United States, its 
        territories or possessions, or its armed forces.''.
            (4) In its April 1, 2011, Memorandum to President Obama, 
        the Office of Legal Counsel concluded: ``President Obama could 
        rely on his constitutional power to safeguard the national 
        interest by directing the anticipated military operations in 
        Libya--which were limited in their nature, scope, and 
        duration--without prior congressional authorization.''.
            (5) On June 15, 2011, in a letter to the Speaker of the 
        House of Representatives from the Department of Defense and 
        Department of State, the Departments informed Congress that 
        ``The President is of the view that the current U.S. military 
        operations in Libya are consistent with the War Powers 
        Resolution and do not under that law require further 
        congressional authorization, because U.S. military operations 
        are distinct from the kind of `hostilities contemplated by the 
        Resolution's 60 day termination provision'.''.
            (6) The precedence set by the Executive Branch in its 
        assertion that Congress plays no role in military actions like 
        those taken in Libya is contrary to the intent of the Framers 
        and of the Constitution which vests sole authority to declare 
        war in the Legislative Branch.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed 
to authorize any use of military force.

SEC. 1264. PROHIBITION ON USE OF DRONES TO KILL UNITED STATES CITIZENS.

    (a) Prohibition.--The Department of Defense may not use a drone to 
kill a citizen of the United States.
    (b) Exception.--The prohibition under subsection (a) shall not 
apply to an individual who is actively engaged in combat against the 
United States.
    (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``drone'' means an 
unmanned aircraft (as defined in section 331 of the FAA Modernization 
and Reform Act of 2012 (49 U.S.C. 40101 note)).

SEC. 1265. SALE OF F-16 AIRCRAFT TO TAIWAN.

    The President shall carry out the sale of no fewer than 66 F-16C/D 
multirole fighter aircraft to Taiwan.

SEC. 1266. STATEMENT OF POLICY AND REPORT ON THE INHERENT RIGHT OF 
              ISRAEL TO SELF-DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation 
        Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) established the policy of 
        the United States to support the inherent right of Israel to 
        self-defense.
            (2) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation 
        Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) expressed the sense of 
        Congress that the Government of the United States should 
        transfer to the Government of Israel defense articles and 
        defense services such as air refueling tankers, missile defense 
        capabilities, and specialized munitions.
            (3) The inherent right of Israel to self-defense 
        necessarily includes the possession and maintenance by Israel 
        of an independent capability to remove existential threats to 
        its security and defend its vital national interests.
    (b) Policy of the United States.--It is the policy of the United 
States to take all necessary steps to ensure that Israel possesses and 
maintains an independent capability to remove existential threats to 
its security and defend its vital national interests.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that air 
refueling tankers and advanced bunker-buster munitions should 
immediately be transferred to Israel to ensure our democratic ally has 
an independent capability to remove any existential threat posed by the 
Iranian nuclear program and defend its vital national interests.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the President shall submit 
to the House and Senate Armed Services committees, the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the 
House and Senate Appropriations committees a report that--
            (1) identifies all aerial refueling platforms, bunker-
        buster munitions, and other capabilities and platforms that 
        would contribute significantly to the maintenance by Israel of 
        a robust independent capability to remove existential security 
        threats, including nuclear and ballistic missile facilities in 
        Iran, and defend its vital national interests;
            (2) assesses the availability for sale or transfer of items 
        necessary to acquire the capabilities and platforms described 
        in paragraph (1) as well as the legal authorities available for 
        making such transfers; and
            (3) describes the steps the President is taking to 
        immediately transfer the items described in paragraph (1) 
        pursuant to the policy described in subsection (b).

SEC. 1267. REPORT ON COLLECTIVE AND NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF 
              CENTRAL ASIAN AND SOUTH CAUCASUS ENERGY DEVELOPMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Assured access to stable energy supplies is an enduring 
        concern of both the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO).
            (2) Adopted in Lisbon in November 2010, the new NATO 
        Strategic Concept declares that ``[s]ome NATO countries will 
        become more dependent on foreign energy suppliers and in some 
        cases, on foreign energy supply and distribution networks for 
        their energy needs''.
            (3) The report required by section 1233 of the National 
        Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-
        81) reaffirmed the Strategic Concept's assessment of growing 
        energy dependence of some members of the NATO alliance and also 
        noted there is value in the assured access, protection, and 
        delivery of energy.
            (4) Development of energy resources and transit routes in 
        the areas surrounding the Caspian Sea can diversify sources of 
        supply for members of the NATO alliance, particularly those in 
        Eastern Europe.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) Report.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of 
        Energy, submit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
        detailed report on the implications of new energy resource 
        development and distribution networks, both planned and under 
        construction, in the areas surrounding the Caspian Sea for 
        energy security strategies of the United States and NATO.
            (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall 
        include the following:
                    (A) An assessment of the dependence of NATO members 
                on a single oil or natural gas supplier or distribution 
                network.
                    (B) An assessment of the potential of energy 
                resources of the areas surrounding the Caspian Sea to 
                mitigate such dependence on a single supplier or 
                distribution network.
                    (C) Recommendations, if any, for ways in which the 
                United States can help support increased energy 
                security for NATO members.
            (3) Submission of classified information.--The report under 
        this subsection shall be submitted in unclassified form, but 
        may contain a classified annex.
    (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
            (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives; and
            (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Foreign Relations of the Senate.

SEC. 1269. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE TEAR GAS OR OTHER RIOT

SEC. 1272. SENSE OF CONGRESS STRONGLY SUPPORTING THE FULL 
              IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL 
              SANCTIONS ON IRAN AND URGING THE PRESIDENT TO CONTINUE TO 
              STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT OF SANCTIONS LEGISLATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On May 14, 1948, the people of Israel proclaimed the 
        establishment of the sovereign and independent State of Israel.
            (2) On March 28, 1949, the United States Government 
        recognized the establishment of the new State of Israel and 
        established full diplomatic relations.
            (3) Since its establishment nearly 65 years ago, the modern 
        State of Israel has rebuilt a nation, forged a new and dynamic 
        democratic society, and created a thriving economic, political, 
        cultural, and intellectual life despite the heavy costs of war, 
        terrorism, and unjustified diplomatic and economic boycotts 
        against the people of Israel.
            (4) The people of Israel have established a vibrant, 
        pluralistic, democratic political system, including freedom of 
        speech, association, and religion; a vigorously free press; 
        free, fair, and open elections; the rule of law; a fully 
        independent judiciary; and other democratic principles and 
        practices.
            (5) Since the 1979 revolution in Iran, the leaders of the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran have repeatedly made threats against 
        the existence of the State of Israel and sponsored acts of 
        terrorism and violence against its citizens.
            (6) On October 27, 2005, President of Iran Mahmoud 
        Ahmadinejad called for a world without America and Zionism.
            (7) In February 2012, Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei 
        said of Israel, ``The Zionist regime is a true cancer tumor on 
        this region that should be cut off. And it definitely will be 
        cut off.''.
            (8) In August 2012, Supreme Leader Khamenei said of Israel, 
        ``This bogus and fake Zionist outgrowth will disappear off the 
        landscape of geography.''.
            (9) In August 2012, President Ahmadinejad said that ``in 
        the new Middle East * * * there will be no trace of the 
        American presence and the Zionists'';
            (10) The Department of State has designated the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and 
        has characterized the Islamic Republic of Iran as the ``most 
        active state sponsor of terrorism'' in the world.
            (11) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
        provided weapons, training, funding, and direction to terrorist 
        groups, including Hamas, Hizballah, and Shiite militias in Iraq 
        that are responsible for the murder of hundreds of United 
        States service members and innocent civilians.
            (12) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
        provided weapons, training, and funding to the regime of Bashar 
        al Assad that has been used to suppress and murder its own 
        people.
            (13) Since at least the late 1980s, the Government of the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in a sustained and well-
        documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities to 
        acquire a nuclear weapons capability.
            (14) Since September 2005, the Board of Governors of the 
        International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran to be in non-compliance with its safeguards 
        agreement with the IAEA, which Iran is obligated to undertake 
        as a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty on the Non-
        Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, 
        and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 
        (NPT).
            (15) The United Nations Security Council has adopted 
        multiple resolutions since 2006 demanding of the Government of 
        the Islamic Republic of Iran its full and sustained suspension 
        of all uranium enrichment-related and reprocessing activities 
        and its full cooperation with the IAEA on all outstanding 
        issues related to its nuclear activities, particularly those 
        concerning the possible military dimensions of its nuclear 
        program.
            (16) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
        refused to comply with United Nations Security Council 
        resolutions or to fully cooperate with the IAEA.
            (17) In November 2011, the IAEA Director General issued a 
        report that documented ``serious concerns regarding possible 
        military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme'', and affirmed 
        that information available to the IAEA indicates that ``Iran 
        has carried out activities relevant to the development of a 
        nuclear explosive device'' and that some activities may be 
        ongoing.
            (18) The Government of Iran stands in violation of the 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights for denying its citizens 
        basic freedoms, including the freedoms of expression, religion, 
        peaceful assembly and movement, and for flagrantly abusing the 
        rights of minorities and women.
            (19) In his State of the Union Address on January 24, 2012, 
        President Barack Obama stated, ``Let there be no doubt: America 
        is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, 
        and I will take no options off the table to achieve that 
        goal.''.
            (20) Congress has passed and the President has signed into 
        law legislation imposing significant economic and diplomatic 
        sanctions on Iran to encourage the Government of Iran to 
        abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons and end its support for 
        terrorism.
            (21) These sanctions, while having significant effect, have 
        yet to persuade Iran to abandon its illicit pursuits and comply 
        with United Nations Security Council resolutions.
            (22) More stringent enforcement of sanctions legislation, 
        including elements targeting oil exports and access to foreign 
        exchange, could still lead the Government of Iran to change 
        course.
            (23) In his State of the Union Address on February 12, 
        2013, President Obama reiterated, ``The leaders of Iran must 
        recognize that now is the time for a diplomatic solution, 
        because a coalition stands united in demanding that they meet 
        their obligations. And we will do what is necessary to prevent 
        them from getting a nuclear weapon.''.
            (24) On March 4, 2012, President Obama stated, ``Iran's 
        leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of 
        containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a 
        nuclear weapon.''.
            (25) On October 22, 2012, President Obama said of Iran, 
        ``The clock is ticking * * * And we're going to make sure that 
        if they do not meet the demands of the international community, 
        then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure 
        they don't have a nuclear weapon.''.
            (26) On May 19, 2011, President Obama stated, ``Every state 
        has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able to 
        defend itself, by itself, against any threat.''.
            (27) On September 21, 2011, President Obama stated, 
        ``America's commitment to Israel's security is unshakeable. Our 
        friendship with Israel is deep and enduring.''.
            (28) On March 4, 2012, President Obama stated, ``And 
        whenever an effort is made to delegitimize the state of Israel, 
        my administration has opposed them. So there should not be a 
        shred of doubt by now: when the chips are down, I have Israel's 
        back.''.
            (29) On October 22, 2012, President Obama stated, ``Israel 
        is a true friend. And if Israel is attacked, America will stand 
        with Israel. I've made that clear throughout my presidency * * 
        * I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.''.
            (30) In December 2012, 74 United States Senators wrote to 
        President Obama ``As you begin your second term as President, 
        we ask you to reiterate your readiness to take military action 
        against Iran if it continues its efforts to acquire a nuclear 
        weapon. In addition, we urge you to work with our European and 
        Middle Eastern allies to demonstrate to the Iranians that a 
        credible and capable multilateral coalition exists that would 
        support a military strike if, in the end, this is unfortunately 
        necessary.''.
            (31) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation 
        Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-150) stated that it is United 
        States policy to support Israel's inherent right to self-
        defense.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) reaffirms the special bonds of friendship and 
        cooperation that have existed between the United States and the 
        State of Israel for more than sixty years and that enjoy 
        overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress and among the 
        people of the United States;
            (2) strongly supports the close military, intelligence, and 
        security cooperation that President Obama has pursued with 
        Israel and urges this cooperation to continue and deepen;
            (3) deplores and condemns, in the strongest possible terms, 
        the reprehensible statements and policies of the leaders of the 
        Islamic Republic of Iran threatening the security and existence 
        of Israel;
            (4) recognizes the tremendous threat posed to the United 
        States, the West, and Israel by the Government of Iran's 
        continuing pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability;
            (5) reiterates that the policy of the United States is to 
        prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon capability and to 
        take such action as may be necessary to implement this policy;
            (6) reaffirms its strong support for the full 
        implementation of United States and international sanctions on 
        Iran and urges the President to continue and strengthen 
        enforcement of sanctions legislation;
            (7) declares that the United States has a vital national 
        interest in, and unbreakable commitment to, ensuring the 
        existence, survival, and security of the State of Israel, and 
        reaffirms United States support for Israel's right to self-
        defense; and
            (8) urges that, if the Government of Israel is compelled to 
        take military action in legitimate self-defense against Iran's 
        nuclear weapons program, the United States Government should 
        stand with Israel and provide, in accordance with United States 
        law and the constitutional responsibility of Congress to 
        authorize the use of military force, diplomatic, military, and 
        economic support to the Government of Israel in its defense of 
        its territory, people, and existence.
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed as an authorization for the use of force or a declaration of 
war.

SEC. 1273. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ILLEGAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAMS OF 
              IRAN AND NORTH KOREA.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the paramount security concern of the United States is 
        the ongoing and illegal nuclear weapons programs of the Islamic 
        Republic of Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea;
            (2) it should be the primary objective of the President of 
        the United States to ensure that North Korea's nuclear program 
        is completely and verifiably eliminated and that Iran, and its 
        terrorist proxies, are not allowed to develop nuclear weapons 
        capability and the means to deliver them;
            (3) the continuing failure to compel Iran and North Korea 
        to comply with their respective obligations under international 
        law risks greater nuclear proliferation throughout already 
        unstable regions by states that have chosen, but not 
        irreversibly so, to refrain from developing or acquiring their 
        own nuclear weapons capability;
            (4) nuclear arms reductions by the United States and the 
        Russian Federation have not persuaded or otherwise incentivized 
        Iran and North Korea to halt or reverse their destabilizing and 
        dangerous nuclear weapons programs, nor have they resulted in 
        increased cooperation by other states to deal with these 
        threats; and
            (5) the President should use all international fora 
        available to the President to pursue the complete and 
        verifiable elimination of the nuclear weapons programs of Iran 
        and North Korea as the President's paramount obligation to the 
        security of the American people.

            (2) Report.--If the Secretary waives the limitation in 
        subsection (a) pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall 
        submit to the congressional defense committees, not later than 
        30 days before purchasing equipment from Rosoboronexport 
        pursuant to the waiver, a report on the waiver. The report 
        shall be submitted in classified or unclassified form, at the 
        election of the Secretary. The report shall include the 
        following:
                    (A) An explanation why it is in the national 
                security interest of the United States to purchase

                    (C) An assessment of the cooperation of

                advanced anti-aircraft missiles have been delivered to 
                the Assad regime by Rosoboronexport.
                    (E) A list of the contracts that Rosoboronexport 
                has signed with the Assad regime since January 1, 2013.
    (c) Requirement for Competitively Bid Contracts.--The Secretary of 
Defense shall award any contract that will use United States funds for 
the procurement of helicopters for the Afghan Security Forces using 
competitive procedures based on requirements developed by the Secretary 
of Defense.

        after conveyance of property areas 4-1 and 4-2, the net 
        proceeds derived from any subsequent conveyance of these 
        parcels to third-party buyers or from any lease of areas 4-1 or

SEC. 2865. DESIGNATION OF DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS NATIONAL MEMORIAL 
              IN RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The most reliable statistics regarding the number of 
        members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the 
        Distinguished Flying Cross indicate that 126,318 members of the 
        Armed Forces received the medal during World War II, 
        approximately 21,000 members received the medal during the 
        Korean conflict, and 21,647 members received the medal during 
        the Vietnam War. Since the end of the Vietnam War, more than 
        203 Armed Forces members have received the medal in times of 
        conflict.
            (2) The National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, 
        Missouri, burned down in 1973, and thus many more recipients of 
        the Distinguished Flying Cross may be undocumented. Currently, 
        the Department of Defense continues to locate and identify 
        members of the Armed Forces who have received the medal and are 
        undocumented.
            (3) The United States currently lacks a national memorial 
        dedicated to the bravery and sacrifice of those members of the 
        Armed Forces who have distinguished themselves by heroic deeds 
        performed in aerial flight.
            (4) An appropriate memorial to current and former members 
        of the Armed Forces is under construction at March Field Air 
        Museum in Riverside, California.
            (5) This memorial will honor all those members of the Armed 
        Forces who have distinguished themselves in aerial flight, 
        whether documentation of such members who earned the 
        Distinguished Flying Cross exists or not.
    (b) Designation.--The memorial to members of the Armed Forces who 
have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, located at March 
Field Air Museum in Riverside, California, is hereby designated as the 
Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial.
    (c) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial designated by 
this section is not a unit of the National Park System, and the 
designation of the national memorial shall not be construed to require 
or permit Federal funds to be expended for any purpose related to the 
national memorial.

SEC. 2866. ESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY DIVERS MEMORIAL AT WASHINGTON NAVY

has been carried out beneath the waters of the world.

memorial, the Secretary shall seek to maximize visitor access to the 
memorial.
    (c) Military Support.--The Secretary shall provide military 
ceremonial support at the dedication of the memorial authorized by 
subsection (a).
    (d) Use of Federal Funds Prohibited.--Federal funds may not be used 
to design, procure, prepare, install, or maintain the memorial 
authorized by subsection (a), but the Secretary may accept and expend 
contributions of non-Federal funds and resources for such purposes.

    ``(a) Authorized Inclusion.--For the purpose of honoring the 
sacrifice of members of the United States Armed Forces, including those

        decontamination is practicable and economically feasible

        because of their contaminated state, or if at the expiration of 
        the withdrawal and reservation made by section 3001 the 
        Secretary of the Interior determines that some of the lands 
        withdrawn and reserved are contaminated to an extent which 
        prevents opening such contaminated lands to operation of the 
        public land laws--
                    (A) the Secretary of the Army shall take 
                appropriate steps to warn the public of the 
                contaminated state of such lands and any risks 
                associated with entry onto such lands;
                    (B) after the expiration of the withdrawal and 
                reservation, the Secretary of the Army shall undertake

interest to accept the lands proposed for relinquishment pursuant to 
subsection (a), the Secretary of the Interior may order the revocation 
of the withdrawal and reservation made by section 3001 as it applies to 
such lands. The Secretary of the Interior shall publish in the Federal 
Register the revocation order, which shall--
            (1) terminate the withdrawal and reservation;
            (2) constitute official acceptance of the lands by the 
        Secretary of the Interior; and

        the operation of some or all of the public land laws, including 
        the mining laws.

SEC. 3122. EXTENSION OF PRINCIPLES OF PILOT PROGRAM TO ADDITIONAL 
              FACILITIES OF THE NUCLEAR SECURITY ENTERPRISE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In April 2006, the Administrator for Nuclear Security 
        initiated a pilot program to improve and streamline oversight 
        of the Kansas City Plant of the National Nuclear Security 
        Administration.
            (2) In a memorandum initiating the pilot, the Administrator 
        cited slow progress in implementing previous efforts to 
        streamline such oversight, saying that such slow progress ``is 
        a reflection of excessive risk aversion''.
            (3) The pilot program shifted away from reliance on 
        directives of the Department of Energy and toward third-party 
        certification and industrial standards whenever possible--but 
        the pilot program specifically exempted certain high-hazard 
        operations from its scope.
            (4) An independent assessment conducted one year after 
        initiation of the pilot found approximately $14,000,000 had 
        been saved in fiscal year 2007 because of the pilot program.
            (5) The independent assessment found that ``the replacement 
        of Department of Energy prescriptive requirements with site 
        specific standards and operating systems was observed to be a 
        significant cost reduction driver * * * in several business 
        areas, this reduction was accomplished by moving toward the use 
        of metrics and benchmarks rather than transactional 
        oversight.''.
            (6) The independent assessment further found that ``no 
        immediate or negative impacts were observed as a result'' of 
        the pilot program and that ``the lessons learned at [the Kansas 
        City Plant] can and should be applied at other NNSA and DOE 
        sites'', while acknowledging that application of such lessons 
        would be limited by the presence of high-risk, high-hazard 
        activities at such locations.
            (7) The independent assessment concluded, ``it is our 
        opinion that these elements can be encouraged and developed 
        over time at each NNSA facility, subject to the limitations 
        made necessary by the nature of the site.''.
    (b) Extension of Policies.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided by paragraph (2), the 
        Administrator for Nuclear Security shall--
                    (A) ensure that the principles of the pilot program 
                are permanently implemented at the Kansas City Plant of 
                the National Nuclear Security Administration; and
                    (B) in accordance with paragraph (3), extend such 
                principles of the pilot program, with modifications as 
                the Administrator determines appropriate, to not less 
                than two additional facilities of the nuclear security 
                enterprise (as defined in section 4002(5) of the Atomic 
                Energy Defense Act (50 U.S.C. 2501(5)), with such 
                principles commencing at each facility not later than 
                one year after the date of the enactment of this Act.
            (2) Exemption.--In carrying out the extension of the 
        principles of the pilot program pursuant to subparagraph (A) 
        and (B) of paragraph (1), the Administrator--
                    (A) may exempt high-hazard or high-risk activities 
                from such extension;
                    (B) shall exempt nuclear operations from such 
                extension; and
                    (C) shall focus the initial extension of such 
                principles on low-risk, high-reward initiatives.
            (3) Implementation.--
                    (A) In extending the principles of the pilot 
                program to not less than two facilities under paragraph 
                (1)(B), the Administrator shall certify to the 
                appropriate congressional committees that--
                            (i) the management and operating contractor 
                        for such a facility has sufficiently mature 
                        processes, as well as high performance, to 
                        enable the extension without undue risk; and
                            (ii) Federal oversight mechanisms are in 
                        place and sufficiently mature to enable the 
                        extension without undue risk.
                    (B) If the Administrator cannot make a 
                certification under subparagraph (A) with respect to a 
                facility--
                            (i) the Administrator shall delay the 
                        extension of the principles of the pilot 
                        program to such facility until the date on 
                        which the Administrator makes such 
                        certification; and
                            (ii) not later than one year after the date 
                        of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator 
                        shall submit to the appropriate congressional 
                        committees a report regarding--
                                    (I) the improvements to processes, 
                                procedures, and performance that are 
                                required to make such certification;
                                    (II) a plan with respect to the 
                                activities that the Administrator will 
                                carry out to make such improvements; 
                                and
                                    (III) the date by which the 
                                Administrator expects to make such 
                                certification and extend the principles 
                                of the pilot program.

SEC. 3503. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) It is in the interest of United States national 
        security that the United States merchant marine, both ships and 
        mariners, serve as a naval auxiliary in times of war or 
        national emergency.
            (2) The readiness of the United States merchant fleet 
        should be augmented by a Government-owned reserve fleet 
        comprised of ships with national defense features that may not 
        be available immediately in sufficient numbers or types in the 
        active United States-owned, United States-flagged, and United 
        States-crewed commercial industry.
            (3) The Ready Reserve Force of the Maritime Administration, 
        a component of the National Defense Reserve Fleet, plays an 
        important role in United States national security by providing 
        necessary readiness and efficiency in the form of a Government-
        owned sealift fleet.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) maintaining a United States shipbuilding base is 
        critical to meeting United States national security 
        requirements;
            (2) it is of vital importance that the Ready Reserve Force 
        of the Maritime Administration remains capable, modern, and 
        efficient in order to best serve the national security needs of 
        the United States in times of war or national emergency;
            (3) Federal agencies must consider investment options for 
        replacing aging vessels within the Ready Reserve Force to meet 
        future operational commitments;
            (4) investment in recapitalizing the Ready Reserve Force 
        may include--
                    (A) construction of dual-use vessels, based on 
                need, for use in the America's Marine Highway Program 
                of the Department of Transportation, as a recent study 
                performed under a cooperative agreement between the 
                Maritime Administration and the Navy demonstrated that 
                dual-use vessels transporting domestic freight between 
                United States ports could be called upon to supplement 
                sealift capacity;
                    (B) construction of tanker vessels to meet military 
                transport needs; and
                    (C) construction of vessels for use in transporting 
                potential new energy exports; and
            (5) the Department of Transportation, in consultation with 
        the Navy, should pursue the most cost-effective means of 
        recapitalizing the Ready Reserve Force, including by promoting 
        the building of new vessels that are militarily useful and 
        commercially viable.

        funding to strategic seaports in support of national security 
        requirements.
            (2) Strategic seaport defined.--In this subsection the term 
        ``strategic seaport'' means a military port or and commercial 
        port that is subject to a port planning order or Basic Ordering 
        Agreement (or both) that is projected to be used for the 
        deployment of forces and shipment of ammunition or sustainment 
        supplies in support of military operations.
    (b) Financial Assistance.--Section 50302(c)(2)(D) of title 46,

including grants,'' after ``technical assistance''.

        of title 10, United States Code, or on competitive procedures; 
        and
            (2) comply with other applicable provisions of law.
    (c) Relationship to Transfer and Programming Authority.--An amount 
specified in the funding tables in this division may be transferred or 
reprogrammed under a transfer or reprogramming authority provided by 
another provision of this Act or by other law. The transfer or 
reprogramming of an amount specified in such funding tables shall not 
count against a ceiling on such transfers or reprogrammings under 
section 1001 or section 1522 of this Act or any other provision of law, 
unless such transfer or reprogramming would move funds between 
appropriation accounts.
    (d) Applicability to Classified Annex.--This section applies to any 
classified annex that accompanies this Act.
    (e) Oral and Written Communications.--No oral or written 
communication concerning any amount specified in the funding tables in
