Denies such credit to students who are convicted of a federal or state felony offense involving the possession or distribution of a controlled substance.\n\nAllows an exclusion from gross income of any amount received as a Federal Pell Grant.\n\nEstablishes programs for: (1) periodic payments to students as qualified expenses are incurred during the taxable year, and (2) informing the public of the availability of the American Opportunity Tax Credit."
