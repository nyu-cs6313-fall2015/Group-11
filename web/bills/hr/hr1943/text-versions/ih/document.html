                                 A BILL


 
 To establish a task force to review policies and measures to promote, 
  and to develop best practices for, reduction of short-lived climate 
                  pollutants, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Super Pollutant Emissions Reduction 
Act of 2013'' or the ``SUPER Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Carbon dioxide is estimated to account for 55 to 60 
        percent of anthropogenic radiative forcing (or manmade global 
        warming), while the remainder is driven by non-carbon dioxide 
        climate pollutants, primarily short-lived climate pollutants. 
        These short-lived climate pollutants, or ``super pollutants'', 
        have shorter atmospheric lifespans than carbon dioxide but 
        cause much more warming per molecule, and in many cases the 
        emissions are growing much faster than carbon dioxide.
            (2) Several of the short-lived climate pollutants are also 
        potent air pollutants that harm human health and reduce crop 
        yields. Reducing these pollutants can save thousands of lives 
        every year in the United States and millions globally, while 
        also increasing agricultural production.
            (3) International efforts to address short-lived climate 
        pollutants are underway, including the Climate and Clean Air 
        Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants, led by the 
        Department of State and the United Nations Environment 
        Programme, the Global Methane Initiative, and the negotiation 
        of amendments to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that 
        Deplete the Ozone Layer.
            (4) Many of the technologies to reduce short-lived climate 
        pollutants already exist, but adoption of such technologies has 
        been slow.
            (5) The Federal Government has a number of programs and 
        initiatives some of which aim to, or the outcomes of which, 
        reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants, but these 
        programs are scattered across multiple agencies and there is 
        insufficient coordination to maximize reductions of these 
        pollutants. In February 2012, the Government Accountability 
        Office published an annual report, ``Opportunities to Reduce 
        Duplication, Overlap and Fragmentation, Achieve Savings, and 
        Enhance Revenue'', which examined the efficiency and efficacy 
        of government programs, including those that address diesel 
        emissions that contain black carbon, a short-lived climate 
        pollutant.
            (6) Executive Order 13514 requires Federal agencies to 
        develop plans for reducing hydrofluorocarbons and methane, but 
        few agencies have focused on these compounds in their annual 
        Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans.
            (7) Because of their short atmospheric lifetimes, reducing 
        global emissions of short-lived climate pollutants can quickly 
        cut the rate of global temperature rise in half, by 2050, and 
        help stabilize global temperatures below 2C above pre-
        industrial temperatures by 2100, when combined with reductions 
        of global emissions of carbon dioxide. Cutting short-lived 
        climate pollutants along with carbon dioxide can also reduce 
        the rate of projected global sea-level rise by half and total 
        sea-level rise by a third. Steps to reduce short-lived climate 
        pollutants are likely to have air quality and public health 
        benefits as well.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to--
            (1) coordinate and optimize the Federal Government's 
        existing efforts to address short-lived climate pollutants;
            (2) reduce overlap and duplication of such efforts; and
            (3) encourage Federal operations, programs, policies, and 
        initiatives to reduce short-lived climate pollutants by--
                    (A) ensuring that the coordinated Federal programs 
                are effective and forward-looking in their efforts to 
                control short-lived climate pollutants;
                    (B) ensuring coordination of such Federal 
                operations, programs, policies, and initiatives with 
                State, local, regional, tribal, and industry efforts; 
                and
                    (C) supporting such State, local, regional, tribal, 
                and industry efforts.

SEC. 3. TASK FORCE ON SUPER POLLUTANTS.

    (a) Establishment.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the President shall establish the ``Task Force 
on Super Pollutants'' (referred to in this section as the ``Task 
Force'').
    (b) Duties.--The Task Force shall--
            (1) review existing and potential policies and measures 
        that promote reduction of short-lived climate pollutants, in 
        part by identifying and evaluating programs and activities of 
        the Federal government that contribute, or could contribute, to 
        such reduction;
            (2) identify and recommend specific existing Federal 
        programs and activities evaluated under paragraph (1) that are 
        unnecessarily duplicative and can be consolidated to achieve 
        greater efficiency and effectiveness;
            (3) identify gaps where programs do not exist, and 
        recommend focused programs and activities to fill these gaps to 
        achieve reductions of short-lived climate pollutants, with an 
        emphasis on industry standards and public-private partnerships 
        where possible;
            (4) identify, compile, evaluate, and develop best practices 
        for reductions of short-lived climate pollutants, including 
        by--
                    (A) identifying and evaluating both domestic and 
                international best practices and standards practiced 
                and set by governments, industry in each sector listed 
                in subsection (c)(5), standards bodies, and other 
                relevant institutions; and
                    (B) identifying and evaluating cost-effective 
                mitigation projects, strategies, and policies at the 
                State, local, and tribal level, with the greatest 
                potential for reduction of short-lived climate 
                pollutants; and
            (5) not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, submit to Congress a report on the findings and 
        recommendations developed under paragraphs (1) through (4).
    (c) Members.--The task force established under subsection (a) shall
