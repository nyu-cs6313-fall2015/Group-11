SEC. 352. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ACCESS TO TRAINING RANGES WITHIN UNITED 
              STATES PACIFIC COMMAND AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Reliable access to military training ranges is an 
        essential component of military readiness.
            (2) The training opportunities provided by military 
        training ranges are critical to maintaining the technical and 
        operational superiority of the Armed Forces.
            (3) The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review states that the 
        operational readiness of the Armed Forces hinges on unimpeded 
        access to land, air, and sea training and test space.
            (4) The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review states that United 
        States forces in the Asia-Pacific region ``will resume regular 
        bilateral and multilateral training exercises, pursue increased 
        training opportunities to improve capabilities and capacity of 
        partner nations, as well as support humanitarian, disaster 
        relief, counterterrorism, and other operations that contribute 
        to the stability of the region''.
            (5) A number of critical military training ranges, 
        including the Pohakuloa Training Center in Hawaii, are located 
        within the United States Pacific Command area of responsibility 
        providing units from all the military services, as well as 
        allied and partner militaries with realistic joint and combined 
        arms training opportunities.
            (6) Due to the ``tyranny of distance'' in the Asia-Pacific 
        region, there are significant challenges in transporting 
        equipment and personnel to the various military training ranges 
        within the United States Pacific Command area of 
        responsibility.
            (7) The Department of Defense continues a number of efforts 
        aimed at preserving military training ranges, while also 
        minimizing the environmental effects of training activities.
            (8) The Department of Defense has a variety of authorities 
        that may be used to mitigate encroachment on military testing 
        and training missions.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings specified in 
subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of 
Defense should--
            (1) ensure that members of the Armed Forces continue to 
        have reliable access to military training ranges;
            (2) optimize the use of multilateral, joint training 
        facilities overseas in order to increase readiness and 
        interoperability with allies and partners of the United States;
            (3) utilize a full range of assets, including both air- and 
        sea-based assets, including inactive Joint High Speed Vessels, 
        to improve accessibility to military training areas within the 
        United States Pacific Command area of responsibility;
            (4) provide stable budget authority for long-term 
        investments in range and test center infrastructure to lower 
        the cost of access to the ranges and training centers;
            (5) take appropriate action to identify and leverage 
        existing authorities and programs, as well as work with State 
        and municipalities to leverage their authorities, to mitigate 
        encroachment or other challenges that have the potential to 
        impact future access or operations on military training ranges;
            (6) maximize the use of the United States Pacific Command 
        training ranges, including Pohakuloa Training Center in Hawaii, 
        by the military departments and increase the use of such 
        training ranges for bilateral and multilateral exercises with 
        regional allies and partners; and
            (7) take appropriate action to leverage existing 
        authorities and programs, as well as work with local 
        governments to leverage their authorities, to address any 
        challenges that have the potential to impede future access to 
        or operations on military training ranges.

new requirement is an activity or function that is not being performed, 
as of the date of consideration for assignment of performance under 
this section, by military personnel, civilian personnel, or contractor 
personnel at a Department of Defense component, organization,

SEC. 1015. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The stability and security of Mexico and the nations of 
        Central America have a direct impact on the stability and 
        security of the United States.
            (2) Over the past decade, a ``balloon effect'' has pushed 
        increased violence and instability into Central America and 
        Mexico from South America.
            (3) Drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations 
        have spread throughout the region, causing instability and lack 
        of rule of law in many nations.
            (4) Illicit networks are used in a variety of illegal 
        activities including the movement of narcotics, humans, 
        weapons, and money.
            (5) According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
        Crime, Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world with 
        92 murders per 100,000 people.
            (6) Currently, Mexico is working to reduce violence created 
        by transnational criminal organizations and address issues 
        spurred by the emergence of internal self defense groups.
            (7) United States Northern Command and United States 
        Southern Command lead the efforts of the Department of Defense 
        in combating illicit networking in Mexico and Central America.
            (8) To combat these destabilizing threats, through a 
        variety of authorities, the Department of Defense advises, 
        trains, educates, and equips vetted troops in Mexico and many 
        of the nations of Central America to build their militaries and 
        police forces, with an emphasis on human rights and building 
        partnership capacity.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Defense should continue to focus on 
        combating illicit networking routes in Mexico and Central 
        America;
            (2) United States Northern Command and United States 
        Southern Command should continue to work together to combat the 
        transnational nature of these threats; and
            (3) the Department of Defense should increase its maritime, 
        aerial and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
        assets in the region in order to reduce the amount of illicit 
        networking flowing into the United States.

SEC. 1025. SENSE OF CONGRESS RECOGNIZING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE SINKING 
              OF U.S.S. THRESHER.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) U.S.S. Thresher was first launched at Portsmouth Naval 
        Shipyard on July 9, 1960.
            (2) U.S.S. Thresher departed Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for 
        her final voyage on April 9, 1963, with a crew of 16 officers, 
        96 sailors, and 17 civilians.
            (3) The mix of that crew reflects the unity of the naval 
        submarine service, military and civilian, in the protection of 
        the United States.
            (4) At approximately 7:47 a.m. on April 10, 1963, while in 
        communication with the surface ship U.S.S. Skylark, and 
        approximately 220 miles off the coast of New England, U.S.S. 
        Thresher began her final descent.
            (5) U.S.S. Thresher was declared lost with all hands on 
        April 10, 1963.
            (6) In response to the loss of U.S.S. Thresher, the United 
        States Navy instituted new regulations to ensure the health of 
        the submariners and the safety of the submarines of the United 
        States.
            (7) Those regulations led to the establishment of the 
        Submarine Safety and Quality Assurance program (SUBSAFE), now 
        one of the most comprehensive military safety programs in the 
        world.
            (8) SUBSAFE has kept the submariners of the United States 
        safe at sea ever since as the strongest, safest submarine force 
        in history.
            (9) Since the establishment of SUBSAFE, no SUBSAFE-
        certified submarine has been lost at sea, which is a legacy 
        owed to the brave individuals who perished aboard U.S.S. 
        Thresher.
            (10) From the loss of U.S.S. Thresher, there arose in the 
        institutions of higher education in the United States the ocean 
        engineering curricula that enables the preeminence of the 
        United States in submarine warfare.
            (11) The crew of U.S.S. Thresher demonstrated the ``last 
        full measure of devotion'' in service to the United States, and 
        this devotion characterizes the sacrifices of all submariners, 
        past and present.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes the 51st anniversary of the sinking of 
        U.S.S. Thresher;
            (2) remembers with profound sorrow the loss of U.S.S. 
        Thresher and her gallant crew of sailors and civilians on April 
        10, 1963; and
            (3) expresses its deepest gratitude to all submariners on 
        ``eternal patrol'', who are forever bound together by dedicated 
        and honorable service to the United States of America.

              CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Compromises of classified information cause 
        indiscriminate and long-lasting damage to United States 
        national security and often have a direct impact on the safety 
        of warfighters.
            (2) In 2010, hundreds of thousands of classified documents 
        were illegally copied and disclosed across the Internet.
            (3) Classified information has been disclosed in numerous 
        public writings and manuscripts endangering current operations.
            (4) In 2013, nearly 1,700,000 files were downloaded from 
        United States Government information systems, threatening the 
        national security of the United States and placing the lives of 
        United States personnel at extreme risk. The majority of the 
        information compromised relates to the capabilities, 
        operations, tactics, techniques, and procedures of the Armed 
        Forces of the United States, and is the single greatest 
        quantitative compromise in the history of the United States.
            (5) The Department of Defense is taking steps to mitigate 
        the harm caused by these leaks.
            (6) Congress must be kept apprised of the progress of the 
        mitigation efforts to ensure the protection of the national 
        security of the United States.
    (b) Reports Required.--
            (1) Initial report.--Not later than 60 days after the date

        compromises of classified information. Such report shall 
        include each of the following:
                    (A) A description of any changes made to Department 
                of Defense policies or guidance relating to significant 
                compromises of classified information, including 
                regarding security clearances for employees of the 
                Department, information technology, and personnel 
                actions.
                    (B) An overview of the efforts made by any task 
                force responsible for the mitigation of such 
                compromises of classified information.
                    (C) A description of the resources of the 
                Department that have been dedicated to efforts relating 
                to such compromises.
                    (D) A description of the plan of the Secretary to

        appropriate.

            (2) Recommendations on improvements to such capability as 
        required, including changes to processes or organizations that 
        may be necessary
    (d) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the

SEC. 1217. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES MILITARY COMMITMENT TO 
              OPERATION RESOLUTE SUPPORT IN AFGHANISTAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States continues to have vital national 
        security interests in ensuring that Afghanistan remains a 
        stable, sovereign country and that groups like Al Qaeda, the 
        Haqqani Network, and the Quetta Shura Taliban are not able to 
        use Afghanistan as a safe haven from which to launch attacks;
            (2) the United States should have a residual presence in 
        Afghanistan to train, advise, and assist the ANSF, conduct 
        counterterrorism operations, and support force protection 
        requirements in order to maintain the gains achieved in 
        Afghanistan;
            (3) it is in the interests of both the United States and 
        Afghanistan to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement as soon as 
        practicable after the new President of Afghanistan is sworn in;
            (4) the United States should provide financial, advisory, 
        and other necessary support to the ANSF, at the authorized end-
        strength of 352,000 personnel, through 2018;
            (5) the train, advise, and assist mission, following the 
        end of the NATO mission on December 31, 2014, should be able to 
        assist the ANSF in all parts of Afghanistan;
            (6) uncertainty with the signing of the Bilateral Security 
        Agreement with Afghanistan is threatening the gains achieved by 
        the United States and coalition forces and the United States' 
        enduring vital national security interests in Afghanistan and 
        the region;
            (7) the President should announce the United States 
        residual presence for Operation Resolute Support to reassure 
        the people of Afghanistan and to provide a tangible statement 
        of support for the future of Afghanistan;
            (8) the United States should aggressively work with NATO 
        and the Government of Afghanistan to achieve a status of forces 
        agreement for NATO forces in support of the post-2014 mission; 
        and
            (9) NATO member countries pledged their support and long-
        term commitment to Afghanistan at the Lisbon, Chicago, and 
        Tokyo conferences and should honor their commitments to

SEC. 1225. REPORT ON NON-COMPLIANCE BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION OF ITS 
              OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INF TREATY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Russian Federation is in material breach of its 
        obligations under the Treaty Between the United States of 
        America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the 
        Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range 
        Missiles, commonly referred to as the Intermediate-Range 
        Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed at Washington December 8, 
        1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988; and
            (2) such behavior poses a threat to the United States, its 
        deployed forces, and its allies.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should hold the Russian Federation 
        accountable for being in material breach of its obligations 
        under the INF Treaty;
            (2) the President should demand the Russian Federation 
        completely and verifiably eliminate the military systems that 
        constitute the material breach of its obligations under the INF 
        Treaty;
            (3) the President should seriously consider not engaging in 
        further reductions of United States nuclear forces generally 
        and should seriously consider not engaging in nuclear arms 
        reduction negotiations with the Russian Federation specifically 
        until such complete and verifiable elimination of the military 
        systems has occurred; and
            (4) the President, in consultation with United States 
        allies, should consider whether it is in the national security 
        interests of the United States to unilaterally remain a party 
        to the INF Treaty if the Russian Federation is still in 
        material breach of the INF Treaty beginning one year after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the President shall submit 
to the appropriate congressional committees an unclassified report that 
includes the following:
            (1) The status of the President's efforts, in cooperation 
        with United States allies, to hold the Russian Federation 
        accountable for being in material breach of its obligations 
        under the INF Treaty and obtain the complete and verifiable 
        elimination of its military systems that constitute the 
        material breach of its obligations under the INF Treaty.
            (2) The President's assessment as to whether it remains in 
        the national security interests of the United States to remain 
        a party to the INF Treaty, and other related treaties and 
        agreements, while the Russian Federation is in material breach 
        of its obligations under the INF Treaty.
    (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this section, the 
term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
            (1) the congressional defense committees;
            (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Select 
        Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and

SEC. 1226. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RUSSIAN AGGRESSION TOWARD 
              UKRAINE.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the continuing and long-standing pattern and practice 
        by the Government of the Russian Federation of physical, 
        diplomatic, and economic aggression toward neighboring 
        countries is clearly intended to exert undue influence on the 
        free will of sovereign nations and peoples to determine their 
        own future;
            (2) the Russian military build-up and aggressive posture on 
        the eastern border of Ukraine represent a deliberate intent to 
        intimidate Ukraine and to force its citizens to submit to 
        Russian control;
            (3) the Russian Federation should immediately cease all 
        improper and illegal activities in Ukraine;
            (4) the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, 
        which was executed jointly with the Russian Federation, 
        Ukraine, and the United Kingdom, represents a commitment to 
        respect the independence, sovereignty, and territorial 
        integrity and borders of Ukraine, and Russian actions clearly 
        violate the commitment made by the Russian Federation in that 
        memorandum;
            (5) the security cooperation with the Ukrainian military by 
        the United States military is an important opportunity to 
        support the continued professionalization of the Ukrainian 
        military;
            (6) an enhanced military presence and readiness posture of 
        the United States military in Europe is key to deterring 
        further Russian aggression and assuring allies and partners; 
        and
            (7) the treaty commitments under Article 5 of the North 
        Atlantic Treaty signed at Washington, April 4, 1949, and 
        entered into force August 24, 1949, are important and a 
        cornerstone to international security.

        community leaders and advocates in ending such violence;
            (4) Executive Order 13623 of August 10, 2012 (77 Fed. Reg. 
        49345) established the United States Strategy to Prevent and 
        Respond to Gender-based Violence Globally (in this section 
        referred to as the ``Strategy''), the first such strategy 
        submitted pursuant to the matter relating to section 7061 under 
        the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference 
        accompanying the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and 
        Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2012;
            (5) Executive Order 13623 required the Department of 
        Defense to participate in an Interagency Working Group co-
        chaired by the Department of State and the United States Agency 
        for International Development to implement the Strategy; and
            (6) since the authority for the Strategy was established 
        initially in the matter relating to section 7061 under the 
        Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference 
        accompanying the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and 
        Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2012, it is important for 
        Congress to maintain its appropriate oversight over the 
        implementation of the Strategy.
    (b) Briefings Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of

        Interagency Working Group to implement the Strategy.
            (2) Matters to be included.--As part of the briefings, the 
        Secretary shall describe specifically efforts of the Department 
        of Defense in the Interagency Working Group to implement 
        international violence against women and girls prevention and 
        response strategies, funding allocations, programming, and 
        associated outcomes.
            (3) Appropriate congressional committees defined.--In this

                Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
                Representatives.
    (c) Requirement to Continue Implementation of Strategy and 
Participation in Interagency Working Group.--The Secretary of Defense 
shall ensure that the Department of Defense--
            (1) during the current period of the Strategy, continues to 
        implement the Strategy as appropriate by reason of the role of 
        the Department of Defense in the Interagency Working Group; and
            (2) continues to participate in interagency collaborative 
        efforts to prevent and respond to violence against women and

SEC. 1248. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF ECONOMIC AND 
              FINANCIAL ACTIVITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There is a lack of situational awareness within the 
        Department of Defense concerning how state and non-state 
        adversaries and potential adversaries are interwoven into the 
        international financial and trading systems via legal and licit 
        activities and use such market activities to fund and equip 
        themselves and advance their interests.
            (2) There is a lack of capability within the Department of 
        Defense to formulate policy options within the interagency 
        process, or for consideration within the Department, concerning 
        whether state and non-state adversaries and potential 
        adversaries have key vulnerabilities associated with their 
        positioning within the global economic and financial systems.
            (3) The Department of Defense would benefit from having 
        enhanced situational awareness regarding the commercial and 
        strategic interactions of state and non-state adversaries and 
        potential adversaries within the global economic and financial 
        systems and integrating relevant findings into defense policy 
        options, deterrence strategy, planning and preparedness.
            (4) The state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds 
        of adversaries and potential adversaries represent, in some 
        cases, strategic tools of their controlling governments and 
        their global operations and therefore warrant increased 
        scrutiny and knowledge.
            (5) Without improved situational awareness of the business 
        transactions and financial activities of state and non-state 
        adversaries and potential adversaries, as well as entities they 
        own and control, current efforts and deterrence strategies will 
        continue to represent an underdeveloped defense requirement 
        that lacks strategic direction.
    (b) Enhanced Situational Awareness Required.--The Secretary of 
Defense shall take such steps as may be necessary to improve--
            (1) the situational awareness capabilities of the 
        Department of Defense regarding the legal and licit business 
        transactions and global market positioning of adversaries and 
        potential adversaries; and
            (2) the ability of the Department to translate such 
        situational awareness into the intelligence, planning, 
        deterrence, and capabilities and strategies of the Department.

issuing a temporary visa to a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
or the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
    (b) Prohibition on Judicial Review.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law (whether statutory or nonstatutory), section 242 of

1651 of title 28, United States Code, section 2241 of such title, and

        high level of risk in defending United States posts that are 
        ``high risk, high threat'' posts;
            (3) the United States should posture forces forward and 
        achieve the associated basing and access agreements to support 
        such forces across the Continent of Africa in order to meet the 
        ``New Normal'' and general mission requirements in the area of 
        responsibility of the United States Africa Command;
            (4) the Department of Defense should consider reassigning 
        to the United States Africa Command enabler assets currently 
        assigned to, and shared with, the United States European 
        Command; and
            (5) the United States Africa Command requires more 
        intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets to meet 
        the ``New Normal'' and general mission requirements in its area 
        of responsibility.
    (b) Report.--Not later than January 15, 2015, the Secretary of 
Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Chairman

        States Africa Command to meet the ``New Normal'' and general 
        mission requirements in its area of responsibility, including 
        the gaps or shortfalls in capability, size, posture, 
        agreements, basing, and enabler support of all crisis response 
        forces and associated assets to access and defend posts that 
        are ``high risk, high threat'' posts.
            (3) An assessment of how the United States Africa Command 
        could employ permanently assigned military forces to support 
        all mission requirements of the United States Africa Command.
            (4) An estimate of the annual intelligence, surveillance, 
        and reconnaissance requirements of the United States Africa 
        Command and the shortfall, if any, in meeting such requirements 
        in fiscal year 2015.

SEC. 1264. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES PRESENCE AND COOPERATION 
              IN THE ARABIAN GULF REGION TO DETER IRAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should maintain a robust forward 
        presence and posture in order to support United States allies 
        and partners in the Arabian Gulf region, including Gulf 
        Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Israel, and to deter 
        Iran;
            (2) the United States should seek ways to support the 
        security posture of GCC countries in the Arabian Gulf region to 
        deter Iran;
            (3) key strategic United States bases in the Arabian Gulf 
        region that are used to deter Iran and would be used for any 
        military operations in the Arabian Gulf region are entirely 
        financed by funds for overseas contingency operations which is 
        an unsustainable approach;
            (4) such key strategic United States bases in the Arabian 
        Gulf region should be funded through the base budget of the 
        Department of Defense;
            (5) the United States does not have status of forces 
        agreements and defense agreements with key GCC allies, which 
        would support the defense of the Arabian Gulf region and would 
        deter Iran, and the United States should seek to complete these 
        agreements immediately;
            (6) the interim agreement with Iran relating to Iran's 
        nuclear program does not address key aspects of Iran's nuclear 
        program, including the possible military dimensions of Iran's 
        nuclear program;
            (7) a comprehensive agreement with Iran relating to Iran's 
        efforts to develop a nuclear weapons capability should address 
        past and present issues of concern of the United States, the 
        International Atomic Energy Agency, and the United Nations 
        Security Council;
            (8) the United States should continue to put significant 
        pressure on Iran's network of organizations that conduct malign 
        activities in the Arabian Gulf region, and around the globe, 
        even while the United States engages in negotiations with Iran 
        relating to Iran's nuclear program;
            (9) the United States Government should not enter into a 
        contract with any person or entity that is determined to have 
        violated United States sanctions laws with respect to 
        contracting with the Government of Iran and should encourage 
        United States allies, partners, and other countries to maintain 
        the same contracting standard; and
            (10) a comprehensive agreement with Iran relating to Iran's 
        efforts to develop or acquire a nuclear weapons capability 
        should be agreed to by the United States only if--
                    (A) Iran ceases the enrichment of uranium;
                    (B) Iran has ceased the pursuit, acquisition, and 
                development of, and has verifiably dismantled its 
                nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and ballistic 
                missiles and ballistic missile launch technology; and
                    (C) the Government of Iran has ceased providing 
                support for acts of international terrorism.

SEC. 1265. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MODERNIZATION OF DEFENSE CAPABILITIES 
              OF POLAND.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The efforts of Poland to modernize its defense 
        capabilities and restructure its armed forces have the 
        potential not only to enhance the national security of Poland 
        but also to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        (NATO).
            (2) The main priority of Poland with respect to such 
        efforts is to procure anti-aircraft and missile defense 
        systems.
            (3) At a time when most NATO allies are cutting defense 
        spending, Poland has maintained a steady defense budget and is 
        making significant investment in procurement of new defense 
        systems.
            (4) The United States should recognize the efforts of 
        Poland to modernize its defense capabilities and restructure 
        its armed forces and promote such efforts as a positive example 
        for other NATO allies to follow.
            (5) The United States has enjoyed a close cultural, 
        economic, political, and military relationship with Poland for 
        many years and the efforts of Poland to modernize its defense 
        capabilities and restructure its armed forces provide 
        opportunities for the two countries to work together even more 
        closely.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should seek to work with Poland to ensure 
        that, as part of the efforts of Poland to modernize its defense 
        capabilities and restructure its armed forces--
                    (A) Poland, to the maximum extent practicable, 
                procures defense systems that are interoperable with 
                NATO defense systems and will help fill critical NATO 
                shortfalls; and
                    (B) Poland, to the maximum extent practicable and 
                to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of 
                subparagraph (A), procures United States defense 
                systems that--
                            (i) will strengthen the bilateral, 
                        strategic partnership between the two 
                        countries;
                            (ii) will provide Poland with proven 
                        defense systems capabilities; and
                            (iii) promote deeper and closer bilateral 
                        cooperation between the two countries; and
            (2) the United States stands ready to assist Poland to 
        achieve its goals to modernize its defense capabilities and 
        restructure its armed forces.
