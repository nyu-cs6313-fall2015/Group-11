SEC. 352. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ACCESS TO TRAINING RANGES WITHIN UNITED 
              STATES PACIFIC COMMAND AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Reliable access to military training ranges is an 
        essential component of military readiness.
            (2) The training opportunities provided by military 
        training ranges are critical to maintaining the technical and 
        operational superiority of the Armed Forces.
            (3) The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review states that the 
        operational readiness of the Armed Forces hinges on unimpeded 
        access to land, air, and sea training and test space.
            (4) The 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review states that United 
        States forces in the Asia-Pacific region ``will resume regular 
        bilateral and multilateral training exercises, pursue increased 
        training opportunities to improve capabilities and capacity of 
        partner nations, as well as support humanitarian, disaster 
        relief, counterterrorism, and other operations that contribute 
        to the stability of the region''.
            (5) A number of critical military training ranges, 
        including the Pohakuloa Training Center in Hawaii, are located 
        within the United States Pacific Command area of responsibility 
        providing units from all the military services, as well as 
        allied and partner militaries with realistic joint and combined 
        arms training opportunities.
            (6) Due to the ``tyranny of distance'' in the Asia-Pacific 
        region, there are significant challenges in transporting 
        equipment and personnel to the various military training ranges 
        within the United States Pacific Command area of 
        responsibility.
            (7) The Department of Defense continues a number of efforts 
        aimed at preserving military training ranges, while also 
        minimizing the environmental effects of training activities.
            (8) The Department of Defense has a variety of authorities 
        that may be used to mitigate encroachment on military testing 
        and training missions.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings specified in 
subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of 
Defense should--
            (1) ensure that members of the Armed Forces continue to 
        have reliable access to military training ranges;
            (2) optimize the use of multilateral, joint training 
        facilities overseas in order to increase readiness and 
        interoperability with allies and partners of the United States;
            (3) utilize a full range of assets, including both air- and 
        sea-based assets, including inactive Joint High Speed Vessels, 
        to improve accessibility to military training areas within the 
        United States Pacific Command area of responsibility;
            (4) provide stable budget authority for long-term 
        investments in range and test center infrastructure to lower 
        the cost of access to the ranges and training centers;
            (5) take appropriate action to identify and leverage 
        existing authorities and programs, as well as work with State 
        and municipalities to leverage their authorities, to mitigate 
        encroachment or other challenges that have the potential to 
        impact future access or operations on military training ranges;
            (6) maximize the use of the United States Pacific Command 
        training ranges, including Pohakuloa Training Center in Hawaii, 
        by the military departments and increase the use of such 
        training ranges for bilateral and multilateral exercises with 
        regional allies and partners; and
            (7) take appropriate action to leverage existing 
        authorities and programs, as well as work with local 
        governments to leverage their authorities, to address any 
        challenges that have the potential to impede future access to 
        or operations on military training ranges.

of temporary shuttle-bus service for air show or open house visitors. 
If costs are incurred and covered in advance of the collection of the 
fees, amounts collected shall be credited to the fund or account that

factor in determining the best interest of the child.
    ``(c) No Federal Jurisdiction or Right of Action or Removal.--
Nothing in this section shall create a Federal right of action or 
otherwise give rise to Federal jurisdiction or create a right of 
removal.
    ``(d) Preemption.--In any case where State law applicable to a 
child custody proceeding involving a temporary order as contemplated in 
this section provides a higher standard of protection to the rights of

under this section with respect to such temporary order, the

SEC. 548. ROLE OF MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS IN ADDRESSING 
              UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT OF SPOUSES OF MEMBERS OF 
              THE ARMED FORCES AND CLOSING THE WAGE GAP BETWEEN 
              MILITARY SPOUSES AND THEIR CIVILIAN COUNTERPARTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Members of the Armed Forces and their families make 
        enormous sacrifices in defense of the United States.
            (2) Military spouses face a unique lifestyle marked by 
        frequent moves, increased family responsibility during 
        deployments, and limited career opportunities in certain 
        geographic locations.
            (3) These circumstances present significant challenges to 
        military spouses who desire to build a portable career 
        commensurate with their skills, including education and 
        experience.
            (4) According to a recent Department of Defense survey, the 
        unemployment rate for civilians married to a military member is 
        25 percent, but the unemployment rate is 33 percent for spouses 
        of junior enlisted members. The same survey revealed that 85 
        percent of military spouses want or need to work.
            (5) A recent Military Officers Association of American 
        (MOAA)/Institute for Veterans and Military Families' (IVMF) 
        Military Spouse Employment Report revealed that an overwhelming 
        ninety percent of female military spouses are underemployed.
            (6) The Department of Defense has demonstrated its 
        commitment to helping military spouses obtain employment by 
        creating the Military Spouse Employment Partnership (MSEP), the 
        Military Spouse Career Center, and the Military Spouse Career 
        Advancement Accounts (MyCAA). More than 61,000 military spouses 
        have been hired as part of the Military Spouse Employment 
        Partnership (MSEP) since the MSEP launch in June 2011.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Secretary of Defense should continue to work to 
        reduce the unemployment and underemployment of spouses of 
        members of the Armed Forces (in this section referred to as 
        ``military spouses'') and support closing the wage gap between 
        military spouses and their civilian counterparts;
            (2) in this process, the Secretary should prioritize 
        efforts that assist military spouses in pursuing portable 
        careers that match their skill set, including education and 
        experience; and
            (3) in evaluating the effectiveness of military spouse 
        employment programs, the Secretary should collect information 
        that provides a comprehensive assessment of the program, 
        including whether program goals are being achieved.
    (c) Data Collection Related to Efforts to Address Underemployment 
of Military Spouses.--
            (1) Data collection required.--In addition to monitoring 
        the number of military spouses who obtain employment through 
        military spouse employment programs, the Secretary of Defense 
        shall collect data to evaluate the effectiveness of military 
        spouse employment programs in addressing the underemployment of 
        military spouses and in closing the wage gap between military 
        spouses and their civilian counterparts. Information collected 
        shall include whether positions obtained by military spouses 
        through military spouse employment programs match their 
        education and experience.
            (2) Report required.--Not later than one year after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
        shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report

                establishing, maintaining and utilizing air bases on 
                ice, with applicability comparable to interior 
                Greenland, where conditions are similar to those of the 
                Antarctic.
                    (C) Map and photograph a full two-thirds of the 
                Antarctic Continent during the classified, hazardous 
                duty/volunteer-only operation involving 4700 sailors, 
                23 aircraft and 13 ships including the first submarine 
                the U.S.S. Sennet, and the aircraft carrier the U.S.S. 
                Philippine Sea, brought to the edge of the ice pack to 
                launch (6) Navy ski-equipped, rocket-assisted R4Ds
                    (D) Consolidate and extend United States 
                sovereignty over the largest practicable area of the 
                Antarctic continent.
                    (E) Determine the feasibility of establishing, 
                maintaining and utilizing bases in the Antarctic and 
                investigating possible base sites.
            (3) While on a hazardous duty/all volunteer mission vital 
        to the interests of National Security and while over the 
        eastern Antarctica coastline known as the Phantom Coast, the 
        PBM-5 Martin Mariner ``Flying Boat'' ``George 1'' entered a 
        whiteout over Thurston Island. As the pilot attempted to climb, 
        the aircraft grazed the glacier's ridgeline and exploded within 
        5 seconds instantly killing Ensign Maxwell Lopez, Navigator and 
        Wendell ``Bud'' Hendersin, Aviation Machinists Mate 1st Class 
        while Frederick Williams, Aviation Radioman 1st Class died 
        several hours later. Six other crewmen survived including the 
        Captain of the ``George 1's'' seaplane tender U.S.S. Pine 
        Island.
            (4) The bodies of the dead were protected from the 
        desecration of Antarctic scavenging birds (Skuas) by the 
        surviving crew wrapping the bodies and temporarily burying the 
        men under the starboard wing engine nacelle.
            (5) Rescue requirements of the ``George 1'' survivors 
        forced the abandonment of their crewmates' bodies.
            (6) Conditions prior to the departure of Task Force 68 
        precluded a return to the area to the recover the bodies.
            (7) For nearly 60 years Navy promised the families that 
        they would recover the men: ``If the safety, logistical, and 
        operational prerequisites allow a mission in the future, every 
        effort will be made to bring our sailors home.''.
            (8) The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command twice offered to 
        recover the bodies of this crew for Navy.
            (9) A 2004 NASA ground penetrating radar overflight 
        commissioned by Navy relocated the crash site three miles from 
        its crash position.
            (10) The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command offered to 
        underwrite the cost of an aerial ground penetrating radar (GPR) 
        survey of the crash site area by NASA.
            (11) The Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command studied the 
        recovery with the recognized recovery authorities and national 
        scientists and determined that the recovery is only ``medium 
        risk''.
            (12) National Science Foundation and scientists from the 
        University of Texas, Austin, regularly visit the island.
            (13) The crash site is classified as a ``perishable site'', 
        meaning a glacier that will calve into the Bellingshausen Sea.
            (14) The National Science Foundation maintains a presence 
        in area of the Pine Island Glacier.
            (15) The National Science Foundation Director of Polar 
        Operations will assist and provide assets for the recovery upon 
        the request of Congress.
            (16) The United States Coast Guard is presently pursuing 
        the recovery of 3 WWII air crewmen from similar circumstances 
        in Greenland.
            (17) On Memorial Day, May 25, 2009, President Barack Obama 
        declared: ``* * * the support of our veterans is a sacred trust 
        * * * we need to serve them as they have served us * * * that 
        means bringing home all our POWs and MIAs * * *''.
            (18) The policies and laws of the United States of America 
        require that our armed service personnel be repatriated.
            (19) The fullest possible accounting of United States 
        fallen military personnel means repatriating living American 
        POWs and MIAs, accounting for, identifying, and recovering the 
        remains of military personnel who were killed in the line of 
        duty, or providing convincing evidence as to why such a 
        repatriation, accounting, identification, or recovery is not 
        possible.
            (20) It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to 
        return to the United States for proper burial and respect all 
        members of the Armed Forces killed in the line of duty who lie 
        in lost graves.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings under subsection 
(a), Congress--
            (1) reaffirms its support for the recovery and return to 
        the United States, the remains and bodies of all members of the 
        Armed Forces killed in the line of duty, and for the efforts by 
        the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command to recover the remains of 
        members of the Armed Forces from all wars, conflicts and 
        missions;
            (2) recognizes the courage and sacrifice of all members of 
        the Armed Forces who participated in Operation Highjump and all 
        missions vital to the national security of the United States of 
        America;
            (3) acknowledges the dedicated research and efforts by the 
        US Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, the 
        Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, the Fallen American Veterans 
        Foundation and all persons and organizations to identify, 
        locate, and advocate for, from their temporary Antarctic grave, 
        the recovery of the well-preserved frozen bodies of Ensign 
        Maxwell Lopez, Naval Aviator, Frederick Williams, Aviation 
        Machinist's Mate 1ST Class, Wendell Hendersin, Aviation 
        Radioman 1ST Class of the ``George 1'' explosion and crash; and
            (4) encourages the Department of Defense to review the 
        facts, research and to pursue new efforts to undertake all 
        feasible efforts to recover, identify, and return the well-
        preserved frozen bodies of the ``George 1'' crew from 
        Antarctica's Thurston Island.

SEC. 598. NAME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND DEPARTMENT OF 
              DEFENSE JOINT OUTPATIENT CLINIC, MARINA, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs and Department 
of Defense joint outpatient clinic to be constructed at the 
intersection of the proposed Ninth Street and the proposed First Avenue 
in Marina, California, shall be known and designated as the ``Major 
General William H. Gourley VA-DOD Outpatient Clinic''.
    (b) References.--Any reference in a law, regulation, map, document, 
record, or other paper of the United States to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense joint outpatient clinic 
referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the 
``Major General William H. Gourley VA-DOD Outpatient Clinic''.

SEC. 599. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PRESERVATION OF SECOND AMENDMENT 
              RIGHTS OF ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL STATIONED OR 
              RESIDING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution 
        provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms 
        shall not be infringed.
            (2) Approximately 40,000 servicemen and women across all 
        branches of the Armed Forces either live in or are stationed on 
        active duty within the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. 
        Unless these individuals are granted a waiver as serving in a 
        law enforcement role, they are subject to the District of 
        Columbia's onerous and highly restrictive laws on the 
        possession of firearms.
            (3) Military personnel, despite being extensively trained 
        in the proper and safe use of firearms, are therefore deprived 
        by the laws of the District of Columbia of handguns, rifles, 
        and shotguns that are commonly kept by law-abiding persons 
        throughout the United States for sporting use and for lawful 
        defense of their persons, homes, businesses, and families.
            (4) The District of Columbia has one of the highest per 
        capita murder rates in the Nation, which may be attributed in 
        part to previous local laws prohibiting possession of firearms 
        by law-abiding persons who would have otherwise been able to 
        defend themselves and their loved ones in their own homes and 
        businesses.
            (5) The Gun Control Act of 1968 (as amended by the Firearms 
        Owners' Protection Act) and the Brady Handgun Violence 
        Prevention Act provide comprehensive Federal regulations 
        applicable in the District of Columbia as elsewhere. In 
        addition, existing District of Columbia criminal laws punish 
        possession and illegal use of firearms by violent criminals and 
        felons. Consequently, there is no need for local laws that only 
        affect and disarm law-abiding citizens.
            (6) On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United 
        States in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller held that 
        the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess 
        a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes, and thus ruled 
        that the District of Columbia's handgun ban and requirements 
        that rifles and shotguns in the home be kept unloaded and 
        disassembled or outfitted with a trigger lock to be 
        unconstitutional.
            (7) On July 16, 2008, the District of Columbia enacted the 
        Firearms Control Emergency Amendment Act of 2008 (D.C. Act 17-
        422; 55 DCR 8237), which places onerous restrictions on the 
        ability of law-abiding citizens from possessing firearms, thus 
        violating the spirit by which the Supreme Court of the United 
        States ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller.
            (8) On February 26, 2009, the United States Senate adopted 
        an amendment on a bipartisan vote of 62-36 by Senator John 
        Ensign to S. 160, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights 
        Act of 2009, which would fully restore Second Amendment rights 
        to the citizens of the District of Columbia.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that active 
duty military personnel who are stationed or residing in the District 
of Columbia should be permitted to exercise fully their rights under 
the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and 
therefore should be exempt from the District of Columbia's restrictions 
on the possession of firearms.

SEC. 735. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON USE OF HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY TO 
              TREAT TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS 
              DISORDER.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress 
        disorder are the signature injuries of the wars in Iraq and 
        Afghanistan.
            (2) Post-traumatic stress disorder is prevalent throughout 
        the regular component of the Armed Forces.
            (3) For example, with respect to Camp Lejeune, North 
        Carolina, which has a base population of 41,753 active duty 
        personnel, including 38,020 marines and 3,533 sailors--
                    (A) 6,616 patients with a principal diagnosis of 
                post-traumatic stress disorder had at least one visit 
                for post-traumatic stress disorder between February 
                2013 and April 2014; and
                    (B) the Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, which had a 
                total of approximately 600,000 outpatient visits during 
                2013, recorded 15,043 outpatient visits for which post-
                traumatic stress disorder was the primary reason for 
                the visit between February 2013 and April 2014.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a medical treatment that 
        can be used to treat active duty members of the Armed Forces 
        for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder 
        if--
                    (A) such treatment is prescribed by a military 
                medical doctor; and
                    (B) a hyperbaric chamber that is owned by the 
                Department of Defense and cleared for clinical use is 
                locally available; and
            (2) the Secretary of Defense should increase awareness 
        among members of the Armed Forces, including military medical 
        doctors, of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat traumatic brain 
        injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Secretary of Veterans Affairs that transfers control and administration 
of the program under subsections (e) through (g) of section 8127 of

        rules are made.
            ``(2) The Administrator shall assume authority and 
        responsibility for maintenance and operation of the database 
        and for verifications under the program. Any verifications 
        undertaken by the Administrator shall employ fraud prevention 
        measures at the time of the initial application, through 
        detection and monitoring processes after initial acceptance, by 
        investigating allegations of potential fraud, removing firms 
        that do not quality from the database, and referring cases for 
        prosecution when appropriate.
            ``(3) Any appeal by a small business concern, at the time 
        that verification is denied or a contract is awarded, of any

        Any disputes between the Secretary and the Administrator shall 
        be resolved by the Director of the Office of Management and 
        Budget.
            ``(B) The Secretary and the Administrator may extend the 
        term of the memorandum of understanding, except for the 
        reimbursement requirement under subparagraph (A). The Secretary 
        and the Administrator may in a separate memorandum of 
        understanding provide for an extension of such reimbursement.

        of this section, and every 180 days thereafter, the Secretary 
        and the Administrator shall report to the Committee on Small 
        Business and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of

        Secretary and the Administrator shall include in the discussion 
        of ways to improve collaboration under the memorandum to

assignment of performance of a new requirement by the Department of 
Defense to military personnel, civilian personnel, or contractor

efficient manner, based on an analysis of the costs to the Federal 
Government in accordance with Department of Defense Instruction 7041.04

Military Manpower and Contract Support') or successor guidance.

requirements of the Department of Defense under policies and procedures

title for determining the most appropriate and cost-efficient mix of 
military, civilian, and contractor personnel to perform the mission of

        performance of the mission of the Department of Defense or pose 
        an unacceptable risk; and

        requirement without regard to whether the employee is a 
        temporary, term, or permanent employee.

new requirement is an activity or function that is not being performed, 
as of the date of consideration for assignment of performance under 
this section, by military personnel, civilian personnel, or contractor 
personnel at a Department of Defense component, organization,

SEC. 1015. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The stability and security of Mexico and the nations of 
        Central America have a direct impact on the stability and 
        security of the United States.
            (2) Over the past decade, a ``balloon effect'' has pushed 
        increased violence and instability into Central America and 
        Mexico from South America.
            (3) Drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations 
        have spread throughout the region, causing instability and lack 
        of rule of law in many nations.
            (4) Illicit networks are used in a variety of illegal 
        activities including the movement of narcotics, humans, 
        weapons, and money.
            (5) According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
        Crime, Honduras has the highest murder rate in the world with 
        92 murders per 100,000 people.
            (6) Currently, Mexico is working to reduce violence created 
        by transnational criminal organizations and address issues 
        spurred by the emergence of internal self defense groups.
            (7) United States Northern Command and United States 
        Southern Command lead the efforts of the Department of Defense 
        in combating illicit networking in Mexico and Central America.
            (8) To combat these destabilizing threats, through a 
        variety of authorities, the Department of Defense advises, 
        trains, educates, and equips vetted troops in Mexico and many 
        of the nations of Central America to build their militaries and 
        police forces, with an emphasis on human rights and building 
        partnership capacity.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Defense should continue to focus on 
        combating illicit networking routes in Mexico and Central 
        America;
            (2) United States Northern Command and United States 
        Southern Command should continue to work together to combat the 
        transnational nature of these threats; and
            (3) the Department of Defense should increase its maritime, 
        aerial and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance 
        assets in the region in order to reduce the amount of illicit 
        networking flowing into the United States.

SEC. 1025. SENSE OF CONGRESS RECOGNIZING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE SINKING 
              OF U.S.S. THRESHER.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) U.S.S. Thresher was first launched at Portsmouth Naval 
        Shipyard on July 9, 1960.
            (2) U.S.S. Thresher departed Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for 
        her final voyage on April 9, 1963, with a crew of 16 officers, 
        96 sailors, and 17 civilians.
            (3) The mix of that crew reflects the unity of the naval 
        submarine service, military and civilian, in the protection of 
        the United States.
            (4) At approximately 7:47 a.m. on April 10, 1963, while in 
        communication with the surface ship U.S.S. Skylark, and 
        approximately 220 miles off the coast of New England, U.S.S. 
        Thresher began her final descent.
            (5) U.S.S. Thresher was declared lost with all hands on 
        April 10, 1963.
            (6) In response to the loss of U.S.S. Thresher, the United 
        States Navy instituted new regulations to ensure the health of 
        the submariners and the safety of the submarines of the United 
        States.
            (7) Those regulations led to the establishment of the 
        Submarine Safety and Quality Assurance program (SUBSAFE), now 
        one of the most comprehensive military safety programs in the 
        world.
            (8) SUBSAFE has kept the submariners of the United States 
        safe at sea ever since as the strongest, safest submarine force 
        in history.
            (9) Since the establishment of SUBSAFE, no SUBSAFE-
        certified submarine has been lost at sea, which is a legacy 
        owed to the brave individuals who perished aboard U.S.S. 
        Thresher.
            (10) From the loss of U.S.S. Thresher, there arose in the 
        institutions of higher education in the United States the ocean 
        engineering curricula that enables the preeminence of the 
        United States in submarine warfare.
            (11) The crew of U.S.S. Thresher demonstrated the ``last 
        full measure of devotion'' in service to the United States, and 
        this devotion characterizes the sacrifices of all submariners, 
        past and present.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes the 51st anniversary of the sinking of 
        U.S.S. Thresher;
            (2) remembers with profound sorrow the loss of U.S.S. 
        Thresher and her gallant crew of sailors and civilians on April 
        10, 1963; and
            (3) expresses its deepest gratitude to all submariners on 
        ``eternal patrol'', who are forever bound together by dedicated 
        and honorable service to the United States of America.

            (4) In 2013, nearly 1,700,000 files were downloaded from 
        United States Government information systems, threatening the 
        national security of the United States and placing the lives of 
        United States personnel at extreme risk. The majority of the 
        information compromised relates to the capabilities, 
        operations, tactics, techniques, and procedures of the Armed 
        Forces of the United States, and is the single greatest

SEC. 1089. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Vietnam Veterans Memorial continues to be a popular 
        and important place of reflection and healing for a generation.
            (2) The simple inscriptions of the names of the Nation's 
        dead bear mute testimony to the sacrifice of more than 58,000 
        Americans, serving as a deep source of comfort and pride for 
        the families of those who were lost.
            (3) 74 sailors were lost aboard the USS Frank E. Evans, 
        which sank after colliding with the HMAS Melbourne on June 3, 
        1969, during a Southeast Asia Treaty Organization exercise just 
        outside the designated combat zone.
            (4) The Frank Evans had been providing support fire for 
        combat operations in Vietnam before the exercise that resulted 
        in the accident and was scheduled to return after the exercise.
            (5) The families of the 74 men lost aboard the USS Frank E. 
        Evans have been fighting for decades to have their loved ones 
        added to the Memorial.
            (6) Exceptions have been granted to inscribe the names on 
        the Vietnam Veterans Memorial for other servicemembers who were 
        killed outside of the designated combat zone, including in 1983 
        when President Ronald Reagan ordered that 68 Marines who died 
        on a flight outside the combat zone be added to the wall.
            (7) Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, in a letter dated 
        December 15, 2010, expressed support for the addition of the 74 
        names of the men lost aboard the USS Frank E. Evans to the 
        Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
            (8) The heroism and sacrifice should never go unrecognized 
        because of an arbitrary line on a map.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should order that the names of the 74 military 
personnel lost aboard the USS Frank E. Evans on June 3, 1969, be added 
to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

SEC. 1090A. SENSE OF CONGRESS RECOGNIZING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
              ALLIED AMPHIBIOUS LANDING ON D-DAY, JUNE 6, 1944, AT 
              NORMANDY, FRANCE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) June 6, 2014, marks the 70th anniversary of the Allied 
        assault at Normandy, France, by American, British, and Canadian 
        troops, which was known as Operation Overlord.
            (2) Before Operation Overlord, the German Army still 
        occupied France and the Nazi government still had access to the 
        raw materials and industrial capacity of Western Europe.
            (3) The naval assault phase on Normandy was code-named 
        ``Neptune'', and the June 6th assault date is referred to as D-
        Day to denote the day on which the combat attack was initiated.
            (4) The D-Day landing was the largest single amphibious 
        assault in history, consisting of approximately 31,000 members 
        of the United States Armed Forces, 153,000 members of the 
        Allied Expeditionary Force, 5,000 naval vessels, and more than 
        11,000 sorties by Allied aircraft.
            (5) Soldiers of 6 divisions (3 American, 2 British, and 1 
        Canadian) stormed ashore in 5 main landing areas on beaches in 
        Normandy, which were code-named ``Utah'', ``Omaha'', ``Gold'', 
        ``Juno'', and ``Sword''.
            (6) Of the approximately 10,000 Allied casualties incurred 
        on the first day of the landing, more than 6,000 casualties 
        were members of the United States Armed Forces.
            (7) The age of the remaining World War II veterans and the 
        gradual disappearance of any living memory of World War II and 
        the Normandy landings make it necessary to increase activities 
        intended to pass on the history of these events, particularly 
        to younger generations.
            (8) The young people of Normandy and the United States have 
        displayed unprecedented commitment to and involvement in 
        celebrating the veterans of the Normandy landings and the 
        freedom that they brought with them in 1944.
            (9) The significant material remains of the Normandy 
        landing, such as shipwrecks and various items of military 
        equipment found both on the Normandy beaches and at the bottom 
        of the sea in French territorial waters, bear witness to the 
        remarkable material resources used by the Allied Armed Forces 
        to execute the Normandy landings.
            (10) Five Normandy beaches and a number of sites on the 
        Normandy coast, including Pointe du Hoc, were the scene of the 
        Normandy landings, and constitute both now and for all time a 
        unique piece of humanity's world heritage, and a symbol of 
        peace and freedom, whose unspoilt nature, integrity, and 
        authenticity must be protected at all costs.
            (11) The world owes a debt of gratitude to the members of 
        the ``greatest generation'' who assumed the task of freeing the 
        world from Nazi and Fascist regimes and restoring liberty to 
        Europe.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) recognizes the 70th anniversary of the Allied 
        amphibious landing on D-Day, June 6, 1944, at Normandy, France, 
        during World War II;
            (2) expresses gratitude and appreciation to the members of 
        the United States Armed Forces who participated in the D-Day 
        operations;
            (3) thanks the young people of Normandy and the United 
        States for their involvement in recognizing and celebrating the 
        70th Anniversary of the Normandy landings with the aim of 
        making future generations aware of the acts of heroism and 
        sacrifice performed by the Allied forces;
            (4) recognizes the efforts of the Government of France and 
        the people of Normandy to preserve, for future generations, the 
        unique world heritage represented by the Normandy beaches and 
        the sunken material remains of the Normandy landing, by 
        inscribing them on the United Nations Educational, Scientific, 
        and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List; and
            (5) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling 
        on the people of the United States to observe the anniversary 
        with appropriate ceremonies and programs to honor the 
        sacrifices of their fellow countrymen to liberate Europe.

have been furnished by a nonprofit organization and that are intended 
for distribution to members of the armed forces. Such supplies may be 
transported only on a space available basis.
    ``(b) Limitations.--(1) The Secretary may not transport supplies 
under subsection (a) unless the Secretary determines that--
            ``(A) the transportation of the supplies is consistent with 
        the policies of the United States;
            ``(B) the supplies are suitable for distribution to members 
        of the armed forces and are in usable condition;
            ``(C) there is a legitimate need for the supplies by the 
        members of the armed forces for whom they are intended; and
            ``(D) adequate arrangements have been made for the 
        distribution and use of the supplies.
    ``(2) Procedures.--The Secretary shall establish procedures for 
making the determinations required under paragraph (1). Such procedures 
shall include inspection of supplies before acceptance for transport.

SEC. 1090C. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AIR FORCE FLIGHT TRAINING AIRCRAFT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Air Force uses the T-1A aircraft to train Air Force 
        pilots to operate tanker and transport aircraft.
            (2) The Air Force is seeking a replacement aircraft for the 
        T-1A which is experiencing obsolescence issues and high costs.
            (3) An effective way to mitigate the T-1A's cost, 
        obsolescence, and complexity issues until a permanent 
        replacement aircraft enters service, is to utilize contractor-
        owned, contractor-operated modern aircraft in the very light 
        jet category.
            (4) Conducting very light jet training via a contractor-
        owned, contractor-operated contract vehicle could provide 
        increased flexibility and reduce unnecessary ownership costs.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Air Force should formally assess the operational 
feasibility, costs, potential savings, and readiness implications of 
utilizing contractor-owned, contractor-operated, very light jet 
aircraft for interim flight instruction until a permanent replacement 
for the T-1A enters service.

SEC. 1090D. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ADVISORY BOARD ON 
              TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND WORKER HEALTH.

        of the Department of Labor site exposure matrix;
            (2) conduct periodic peer reviews of, and approve, medical 
        guidance for part E claims examiners with respect to the 
        weighing of a claimant's medical evidence;
            (3) obtain periodic expert review of evidentiary 
        requirements for part B claims related to lung disease 
        regardless of approval;
            (4) provide oversight over industrial hygienists, 
        Department of Labor staff physicians, and Department of Labor's 
        consulting physicians and their reports to ensure quality, 
        objectivity, and consistency; and
            (5) coordinate exchanges of data and findings with the 
        Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health to the extent 
        necessary (under section 3624 the Energy Employees Occupational 
        Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384o).

SEC. 1217. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES MILITARY COMMITMENT TO 
              OPERATION RESOLUTE SUPPORT IN AFGHANISTAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States continues to have vital national 
        security interests in ensuring that Afghanistan remains a 
        stable, sovereign country and that groups like Al Qaeda, the 
        Haqqani Network, and the Quetta Shura Taliban are not able to 
        use Afghanistan as a safe haven from which to launch attacks;
            (2) the United States should have a residual presence in 
        Afghanistan to train, advise, and assist the ANSF, conduct 
        counterterrorism operations, and support force protection 
        requirements in order to maintain the gains achieved in 
        Afghanistan;
            (3) it is in the interests of both the United States and 
        Afghanistan to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement as soon as 
        practicable after the new President of Afghanistan is sworn in;
            (4) the United States should provide financial, advisory, 
        and other necessary support to the ANSF, at the authorized end-
        strength of 352,000 personnel, through 2018;
            (5) the train, advise, and assist mission, following the 
        end of the NATO mission on December 31, 2014, should be able to 
        assist the ANSF in all parts of Afghanistan;
            (6) uncertainty with the signing of the Bilateral Security 
        Agreement with Afghanistan is threatening the gains achieved by 
        the United States and coalition forces and the United States' 
        enduring vital national security interests in Afghanistan and 
        the region;
            (7) the President should announce the United States 
        residual presence for Operation Resolute Support to reassure 
        the people of Afghanistan and to provide a tangible statement 
        of support for the future of Afghanistan;
            (8) the United States should aggressively work with NATO 
        and the Government of Afghanistan to achieve a status of forces 
        agreement for NATO forces in support of the post-2014 mission; 
        and
            (9) NATO member countries pledged their support and long-
        term commitment to Afghanistan at the Lisbon, Chicago, and 
        Tokyo conferences and should honor their commitments to 
        Afghanistan and the ANSF.

SEC. 1220. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The people of Afghanistan have taken the lead in 
        providing for the security of their country and the successful 
        elections are a positive step in the self-determination of the 
        future of Afghanistan.
            (2) However, no country can be successful in the long-term 
        if a majority of its population is not included in the dialogue 
        and decision-making of such country.
            (3) The women of Afghanistan have made historic strides in 
        the last several years and the elections prove that the women 
        need and have a right to have a voice in the future of 
        Afghanistan.
            (4) To that end, the women of Afghanistan are vital to the 
        development of Afghanistan and the national security of 
        Afghanistan;
            (5) Women are needed to serve Afghanistan in the Afghan 
        National Security Forces (ANSF), not just for the future 
        standing of women in society, but for cultural reasons.
            (6) Therefore, it is important that Afghanistan move 
        forward in increasing the number of women in the ANSF with the 
        current facilities and capacity to meet the requirements 
        Afghanistan has proposed to achieve.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the allocation of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2014 for 
        the ANSF should be prioritized for the recruitment, retention, 
        and training of women in the ANSF;
            (2) current facilities to support women in the ANSF should 
        be fully utilized before additional infrastructure is 
        constructed;
            (3) the Government of Afghanistan should ensure that the 
        fund provided prioritize efforts to increase the number of 
        women serving in the ANSF, as proposed in the Master 
        Ministerial Development Plan for Afghan National Army (ANA) 
        Gender Integration;
            (4) as part of such plan, the conversion of the 13,000 
        women that were trained to support the elections is an 
        important step in increasing the number of women in the ANSF;
            (5) the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan's 
        report, ``A Way to Go: An Update on Implementation of the Law 
        on Elimination of Violence Against Women in Afghanistan'', 
        should be integrated into efforts to enable women to serve in 
        the ANSF; and
            (6) the United States should continue to advocate for the 
        rights and participation of women in Afghanistan in all levels 
        of government and society.

        States Congress.
            (3) The September 11, 2001, attacks were largely planned 
        and carried out by the al-Qaeda terrorist network led by Osama 
        bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al Zawahiri, after which Osama 
        bin Laden enjoyed safe haven in Pakistan from where he 
        continued to plot deadly attacks against the United States and 
        the world.
            (4) The United States has obligated nearly $30 billion 
        between 2002 and 2014 in United States taxpayer money for 
        security and economic aid to Pakistan.
            (5) The United States very generously and swiftly responded 
        to the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake in Pakistan with more than $200 
        million in emergency aid and the support of several United 
        States military aircraft, approximately 1,000 United States 
        military personnel, including medical specialists, thousands of 
        tents, blankets, water containers and a variety of other 
        emergency equipment.
            (6) The United States again generously and swiftly 
        contributed approximately $150 million in emergency aid to 
        Pakistan following the 2010 Pakistan flood, in addition to the 
        service of nearly twenty United States military helicopters, 
        their flight crews, and other resources to assist the Pakistan 
        Army's relief efforts.
            (7) The United States continues to work tirelessly to 
        support Pakistan's economic development, including millions of 
        dollars allocated towards the development of Pakistan's energy 
        infrastructure, health services and education system.
            (8) The United States and Pakistan continue to have many 
        critical shared interests, both economic and security related, 
        which could be the foundation for a positive and mutually 
        beneficial partnership.
            (9) Dr. Shakil Afridi, a Pakistani physician, is a hero to 
        whom the people of the United States, Pakistan and the world 
        owe a debt of gratitude for his help in finally locating Osama 
        bin Laden before more innocent American, Pakistani and other 
        lives were lost to this terrorist leader.
            (10) Pakistan, the United States and the international 
        community had failed for nearly 10 years following attacks of 
        September 11, 2001, to locate and bring Osama bin Laden, who 
        continued to kill innocent civilians in the Middle East, Asia, 
        Europe, Africa and the United States, to justice without the 
        help of Dr. Afridi.
            (11) The Government of Pakistan's imprisonment of Dr. 
        Afridi presents a serious and growing impediment to the United 
        States' bilateral relations with Pakistan.
            (12) The Government of Pakistan has leveled and allowed 
        baseless charges against Dr. Afridi in a politically motivated, 
        spurious legal process.
            (13) Dr. Afridi is currently imprisoned by the Government 
        of Pakistan, a deplorable and unconscionable situation which 
        calls into question Pakistan's actual commitment to countering 
        terrorism and undermines the notion that Pakistan is a true 
        ally in the struggle against terrorism.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Dr. Shakil 
Afridi is an international hero and that the Government of Pakistan 
should release him immediately from prison.

SEC. 1225. REPORT ON NON-COMPLIANCE BY THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION OF ITS 
              OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE INF TREATY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Russian Federation is in material breach of its 
        obligations under the Treaty Between the United States of 
        America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the 
        Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range 
        Missiles, commonly referred to as the Intermediate-Range 
        Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, signed at Washington December 8, 
        1987, and entered into force June 1, 1988; and
            (2) such behavior poses a threat to the United States, its 
        deployed forces, and its allies.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should hold the Russian Federation 
        accountable for being in material breach of its obligations 
        under the INF Treaty;
            (2) the President should demand the Russian Federation 
        completely and verifiably eliminate the military systems that 
        constitute the material breach of its obligations under the INF 
        Treaty;
            (3) the President should seriously consider not engaging in 
        further reductions of United States nuclear forces generally 
        and should seriously consider not engaging in nuclear arms 
        reduction negotiations with the Russian Federation specifically 
        until such complete and verifiable elimination of the military 
        systems has occurred; and
            (4) the President, in consultation with United States 
        allies, should consider whether it is in the national security 
        interests of the United States to unilaterally remain a party 
        to the INF Treaty if the Russian Federation is still in 
        material breach of the INF Treaty beginning one year after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the President shall submit 
to the appropriate congressional committees an unclassified report that 
includes the following:
            (1) The status of the President's efforts, in cooperation 
        with United States allies, to hold the Russian Federation 
        accountable for being in material breach of its obligations 
        under the INF Treaty and obtain the complete and verifiable 
        elimination of its military systems that constitute the 
        material breach of its obligations under the INF Treaty.
            (2) The President's assessment as to whether it remains in 
        the national security interests of the United States to remain 
        a party to the INF Treaty, and other related treaties and 
        agreements, while the Russian Federation is in material breach 
        of its obligations under the INF Treaty.
    (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--In this section, the 
term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
            (1) the congressional defense committees;

        Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and
            (3) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Permanent

SEC. 1226. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RUSSIAN AGGRESSION TOWARD 
              UKRAINE.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the continuing and long-standing pattern and practice 
        by the Government of the Russian Federation of physical, 
        diplomatic, and economic aggression toward neighboring 
        countries is clearly intended to exert undue influence on the 
        free will of sovereign nations and peoples to determine their 
        own future;
            (2) the Russian military build-up and aggressive posture on 
        the eastern border of Ukraine represent a deliberate intent to 
        intimidate Ukraine and to force its citizens to submit to 
        Russian control;
            (3) the Russian Federation should immediately cease all 
        improper and illegal activities in Ukraine;
            (4) the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, 
        which was executed jointly with the Russian Federation, 
        Ukraine, and the United Kingdom, represents a commitment to 
        respect the independence, sovereignty, and territorial 
        integrity and borders of Ukraine, and Russian actions clearly 
        violate the commitment made by the Russian Federation in that 
        memorandum;
            (5) the security cooperation with the Ukrainian military by 
        the United States military is an important opportunity to 
        support the continued professionalization of the Ukrainian 
        military;
            (6) an enhanced military presence and readiness posture of 
        the United States military in Europe is key to deterring 
        further Russian aggression and assuring allies and partners; 
        and
            (7) the treaty commitments under Article 5 of the North 
        Atlantic Treaty signed at Washington, April 4, 1949, and 
        entered into force August 24, 1949, are important and a 
        cornerstone to international security.

SEC. 1247. REQUIREMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO CONTINUE 
              IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED STATES STRATEGY TO PREVENT AND 
              RESPOND TO GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE GLOBALLY AND 
              PARTICIPATION IN INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the most dangerous places to be a woman are some of the 
        most unstable and violent regions in the world and gender-based 
        violence will impact one in three women worldwide and this in 
        turn has a direct impact on United States national security, 
        the stability of nations, the rule of law, democracy, and 
        peace-building processes;
            (2) combating violence against women and girls through the 
        implementation and integration of gender-based violence 
        prevention and response mechanisms throughout United States 
        overseas operations is a critical step toward promoting 
        regional and global stability and achieving sustainable peace 
        and security;
            (3) under the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee 
        of Conference accompanying the Department of State, Foreign 
        Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 
        2055, One Hundred Twelfth Congress), the Secretary of State and 
        the Administrator of the United States Agency for International 
        Development were directed in the matter relating to section 
        7061 to submit to Congress a multi-year strategy to prevent and 
        respond to violence against women and girls in countries where 
        it is common through achievable and sustainable goals, 
        benchmarks for measuring progress, and expected results, 
        including through regular engagement with men and boys as 
        community leaders and advocates in ending such violence;
            (4) Executive Order No. 13623 of August 10, 2012 (77 Fed. 
        Reg. 49345) established the United States Strategy to Prevent 
        and Respond to Gender-based Violence Globally (in this section 
        referred to as the ``Strategy''), the first such strategy 
        submitted pursuant to the matter relating to section 7061 under 
        the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference 
        accompanying the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and 
        Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2012;
            (5) Executive Order No. 13623 required the Department of 
        Defense to participate in an Interagency Working Group co-
        chaired by the Department of State and the United States Agency 
        for International Development to implement the Strategy; and
            (6) since the authority for the Strategy was established 
        initially in the matter relating to section 7061 under the 
        Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference 
        accompanying the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and 
        Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2012, it is important for 
        Congress to maintain its appropriate oversight over the 
        implementation of the Strategy.
    (b) Briefings Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall brief 
        the appropriate congressional committees on efforts of the 
        Department of Defense relating to participation in the 
        Interagency Working Group to implement the Strategy.
            (2) Matters to be included.--As part of the briefings, the 
        Secretary shall describe specifically efforts of the Department 
        of Defense in the Interagency Working Group to implement 
        international violence against women and girls prevention and 
        response strategies, funding allocations, programming, and 
        associated outcomes.
            (3) Appropriate congressional committees defined.--In this 
        subsection, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' 
        means--
                    (A) the Committee on Armed Services and the 
                Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and
                    (B) the Committee on Armed Services and the 
                Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
                Representatives.
    (c) Requirement to Continue Implementation of Strategy and 
Participation in Interagency Working Group.--The Secretary of Defense 
shall ensure that the Department of Defense--
            (1) during the current period of the Strategy, continues to 
        implement the Strategy as appropriate by reason of the role of 
        the Department of Defense in the Interagency Working Group; and
            (2) continues to participate in interagency collaborative 
        efforts to prevent and respond to violence against women and 
        girls.

SEC. 1248. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF ECONOMIC AND 
              FINANCIAL ACTIVITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) There is a lack of situational awareness within the 
        Department of Defense concerning how state and non-state 
        adversaries and potential adversaries are interwoven into the 
        international financial and trading systems via legal and licit 
        activities and use such market activities to fund and equip 
        themselves and advance their interests.
            (2) There is a lack of capability within the Department of 
        Defense to formulate policy options within the interagency 
        process, or for consideration within the Department, concerning 
        whether state and non-state adversaries and potential 
        adversaries have key vulnerabilities associated with their 
        positioning within the global economic and financial systems.
            (3) The Department of Defense would benefit from having 
        enhanced situational awareness regarding the commercial and 
        strategic interactions of state and non-state adversaries and 
        potential adversaries within the global economic and financial 
        systems and integrating relevant findings into defense policy 
        options, deterrence strategy, planning and preparedness.
            (4) The state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds 
        of adversaries and potential adversaries represent, in some 
        cases, strategic tools of their controlling governments and 
        their global operations and therefore warrant increased 
        scrutiny and knowledge.
            (5) Without improved situational awareness of the business 
        transactions and financial activities of state and non-state 
        adversaries and potential adversaries, as well as entities they 
        own and control, current efforts and deterrence strategies will 
        continue to represent an underdeveloped defense requirement 
        that lacks strategic direction.
    (b) Enhanced Situational Awareness Required.--The Secretary of 
Defense shall take such steps as may be necessary to improve--
            (1) the situational awareness capabilities of the 
        Department of Defense regarding the legal and licit business 
        transactions and global market positioning of adversaries and 
        potential adversaries; and
            (2) the ability of the Department to translate such 
        situational awareness into the intelligence, planning, 
        deterrence, and capabilities and strategies of the Department.

Union of Kurdistan From Treatment as Terrorist Organizations.--The 
Secretary of State, after consultation with the Secretary of Homeland

organization in section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(vi)) for the limited purpose of 
issuing a temporary visa to a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
or the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
    (b) Prohibition on Judicial Review.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law (whether statutory or nonstatutory), section 242 of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1252), sections 1361 and 
1651 of title 28, United States Code, section 2241 of such title, and 
any other habeas corpus provision of law, no court shall have 
jurisdiction to review any determination made pursuant to subsection

to integrate missile defense systems of the People's Republic of China 
into missile defense systems of the United States.
    (b) Russian Federation.--
            (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
        missile defense systems of the Russian Federation should not be 
        integrated into the missile defense systems of the United 
        States or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization if such 
        integration undermines the security of the United States or 
        NATO.
            (2) Prohibition.--None of the funds authorized to be 
        appropriated by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal

        obligated or expended to integrate missile defense systems of 
        the Russian Federation into missile defense systems of the 
        United States if such integration undermines the security of 
        the United States or NATO.
            (3) Waiver.--The Secretary of Defense may waive the 
        prohibition in paragraph (2) if the Secretary, in consultation 
        with the Secretary of State, determines that the Russian 
        Federation--
                    (A) has withdrawn military forces and assets from 
                Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, other than at those 
                operating in accordance with its 1997 agreement on the 
                Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet Stationing 
                on the Territory of Ukraine; and
                    (B) has ceased aggressive actions, particularly 
                along Ukraine's eastern border, that have led to a 
                destabilization of the Ukrainian government and the 
                safety of its residents.

SEC. 1251. REPORT, DETERMINATION, AND STRATEGY REGARDING THE TERRORISTS 
              RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK AGAINST UNITED STATES 
              PERSONNEL IN BENGHAZI, LIBYA, AND OTHER REGIONAL THREATS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On September 11, 2012, United States facilities in 
        Benghazi, Libya were attacked by an organized group of armed 
        terrorists, killing United States Ambassador Chris Stevens, 
        Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Tyrone Woods.
            (2) On September 14, 2012, President Obama stated that: 
        ``We will bring to justice those who took them from us * * * 
        making it clear that justice will come to those who harm 
        Americans.''.
            (3) On May 1, 2014, White House spokesman Jay Carney stated 
        that: ``I can assure you that the President's direction is that 
        those who killed four Americans will be pursued by the United 
        States until they are brought to justice. And if anyone doubts 
        that, they should ask * * * friends and family members of Osama 
        bin Laden.''.
            (4) In testimony before Congress in October 2013, the 
        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, 
        asserted that the President lacks the authority to use military 
        force to find and kill the Benghazi attackers.
            (5) Since the Benghazi attacks, the President has not 
        requested authority from Congress to use military force against 
        the Benghazi attackers.
            (6) No terrorist responsible for the Benghazi attacks has 
        been brought to justice.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) the persons and organizations who carried out the 
        attacks on United States personnel in Benghazi, Libya on 
        September 11 and 12, 2012, pose a continuing threat to the 
        national security of the United States;
            (2) the failure to hold any individual responsible for 
        these terrorist attacks is a travesty of justice, and 
        undermines the national security of the United States; and
            (3) the uncertainty surrounding the authority of the 
        President to use force against the terrorists responsible for 
        the attack against United States personnel in Benghazi, Libya, 
        undermines the President as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed 
        Forces of the United States.
    (c) Report and Determination.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to 
        Congress--
                    (A) a report that contains--
                            (i) the identity and location of those 
                        persons and organizations that planned, 
                        authorized, or committed the attacks against 
                        the United States facilities in Benghazi, Libya 
                        that occurred on September 11 and 12, 2012; and
                            (ii) a detailed and specific description of 
                        all actions that have been taken to kill or 
                        capture any of the persons described in clause 
                        (i); and
                    (B) a determination regarding whether the President 
                currently possesses the authority to use the Armed 
                Forces of the United States against all persons and 
                organizations described in subparagraph (A)(i).
            (2) Form.--The report and determination described in this 
        subsection shall be submitted in unclassified form to the 
        maximum extent possible, and may contain a classified annex.
    (d) Strategy to Combat Regional Terrorist Threats.--
            (1) Timing and content.--Not later than 90 days after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit 
        to the appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive 
        strategy to counter the growing threat posed by radical 
        Islamist terrorist groups in North Africa, West Africa, and the 
        Sahel, which shall include, among other things--
                    (A) a strategy to bring to justice those persons 
                who planned, authorized, or committed the terrorist 
                attacks against the United States facilities in 
                Benghazi, Libya that occurred on September 11 and 12, 
                2012;
                    (B) a description of the radical Islamist terrorist 
                groups active in North Africa, West Africa, and the 
                Sahel, including an assessment of their origins, 
                strategic aims, tactical methods, funding sources, 
                leadership, and relationships with other terrorist 
                groups or state actors;
                    (C) a description of the key military, diplomatic, 
                intelligence, and public diplomacy resources available 
                to address these growing regional terrorist threats; 
                and
                    (D) a strategy to maximize the coordination 
                between, and the effectiveness of, United States 
                military, diplomatic, intelligence, and public 
                diplomacy resources to counter these growing regional 
                terrorist threats.
            (2) Form.--The strategy described in this subsection shall 
        be submitted in unclassified form to the maximum extent 
        possible, and may contain a classified annex.
            (3) Definition of appropriate congressional committees.--In 
        this subsection, the term ``appropriate congressional 
        committees'' means--
                    (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee 
                on Foreign Relations, and the Select Committee on 
                Intelligence of the Senate; and
                    (B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee 
                on Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee 
                on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.

SEC. 1252. WAR POWERS OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1793, George Washington said, ``The constitution 
        vests the power of declaring war in Congress; therefore no 
        offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until 
        after they shall have deliberated upon the subject and 
        authorized such a measure.''.
            (2) In a letter to Thomas Jefferson in 1798, James Madison 
        wrote: ``The constitution supposes, what the History of all 
        Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of 
        power most interested in war, and most prone to it. It has 
        accordingly with studied care vested the question of war to the 
        Legislature.''.
            (3) In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution 
        which states in section 2: ``The constitutional powers of the 
        President as Commander-in-Chief to introduce United States 
        Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where 
        imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the 
        circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration 
        of war, (2) specific statutory authorization, or (3) national 
        emergency created by attack upon the United States, its 
        territories or possessions, or its armed forces.''.
            (4) With respect to United States military intervention in 
        Syria, President Obama said, ``But having made my decision as 
        Commander-in-Chief based on what I am convinced is our national 
        security interests, I'm also mindful that I'm the President of 
        the world's oldest constitutional democracy. I've long believed 
        that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in 
        our example as a government of the people, by the people, and 
        for the people. And that's why I've made a second decision: I 
        will seek authorization for the use of force from the American 
        people's representatives in Congress.''.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed 
to authorize any use of military force.

SEC. 1253. LIMITATION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT THE ARMS 
              TRADE TREATY.

    (a) In General.--None of the funds authorized to be appropriated by 
this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2015 for the 
Department of Defense may be obligated or expended to implement the 
Arms Trade Treaty, or to make any change to existing programs, 
projects, or activities as approved by Congress in furtherance of, 
pursuant to, or otherwise to implement the Arms Trade Treaty, unless 
the Arms Trade Treaty has received the advice and consent of the Senate 
and has been the subject of implementing legislation, as required, by 
the Congress.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to preclude the Department of Defense from assisting foreign 
countries in bringing their laws and regulations up to United States 
standards.

SEC. 1254. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing the use of 
force against Syria or Iran.

SEC. 1255. COMBATING CRIME THROUGH INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES.

    The Secretary of Defense is authorized to deploy assets, personnel, 
and resources to the Joint Interagency Task Force South, in 
coordination with SOUTHCOM, to combat the following by supplying 
sufficient intelligence capabilities:
            (1) Transnational criminal organizations.
            (2) Drug trafficking.
            (3) Bulk shipments of narcotics or currency.
            (4) Narco-terrorism.
            (5) Human trafficking.
            (6) The Iranian presence in the Western Hemisphere.

SEC. 1256. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States to undertake a whole-
of-government approach to bolster regional cooperation with countries 
throughout the Western Hemisphere, with the exception of Cuba, to 
counter narcotics trafficking and illicit activities in the Western 
Hemisphere.

SEC. 1257. DECLARATION OF POLICY REGARDING ISRAEL'S LAWFUL EXERCISE OF 
              SELF-DEFENSE.

    Congress declares that it is the policy of the United States to 
fully support Israel's lawful exercise of self-defense, including 
actions to halt regional aggression.

SEC. 1258. STATEMENT OF POLICY AND REPORT ON THE INHERENT RIGHT OF 
              ISRAEL TO SELF-DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation 
        Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) established the policy of 
        the United States to support the inherent right of Israel to 
        self-defense.
            (2) The United States-Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation 
        Act of 2012 (22 U.S.C. 8601 et seq.) expressed the sense of 
        Congress that the Government of the United States should 
        transfer to the Government of Israel defense articles and 
        defense services such as air refueling tankers, missile defense 
        capabilities, and specialized munitions.
            (3) The inherent right of Israel to self-defense 
        necessarily includes the possession and maintenance by Israel 
        of an independent capability to remove existential threats to 
        its security and defend its vital national interests.
    (b) Policy of the United States.--It is the policy of the United 
States to take all necessary steps to ensure that Israel possesses and 
maintains an independent capability to remove existential threats to 
its security and defend its vital national interests.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that air 
refueling tankers and advanced bunker-buster munitions should 
immediately be transferred to Israel to ensure our democratic ally has 
an independent capability to remove any existential threat posed by the 
Iranian nuclear program and defend its vital national interests.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter for a period not 
to exceed four years, the President shall submit to the House and 
Senate Armed Services committees, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the House and Senate 
Appropriations committees a report that--
            (1) identifies all aerial refueling platforms, bunker-
        buster munitions, and other capabilities and platforms that 
        would contribute significantly to the maintenance by Israel of 
        a robust independent capability to remove existential security 
        threats, including nuclear and ballistic missile facilities in 
        Iran, and defend its vital national interests;
            (2) assesses the availability for sale or transfer of items 
        necessary to acquire the capabilities and platforms described 
        in paragraph (1) as well as the legal authorities available for 
        making such transfers; and
            (3) describes the steps the President is taking to 
        immediately transfer the items described in paragraph (1) 
        pursuant to the policy described in subsection (b).

          Subtitle F--Reports and Sense of Congress Provisions

SEC. 1261. REPORT ON ``NEW NORMAL'' AND GENERAL MISSION REQUIREMENTS OF 
              UNITED STATES AFRICA COMMAND.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States Africa Command should have sufficient 
        assigned military forces; intelligence, surveillance, and 
        reconnaissance assets; crisis response forces; and enablers to 
        support the crisis response forces to meet the ``New Normal'' 
        and general mission requirements in the area of responsibility 
        of the United States Africa Command;
            (2) with the current force posture and structure of the 
        United States Africa Command, the United States is accepting a 
        high level of risk in defending United States posts that are 
        ``high risk, high threat'' posts;
            (3) the United States should posture forces forward and 
        achieve the associated basing and access agreements to support 
        such forces across the Continent of Africa in order to meet the 
        ``New Normal'' and general mission requirements in the area of 
        responsibility of the United States Africa Command;
            (4) the Department of Defense should consider reassigning 
        to the United States Africa Command enabler assets currently 
        assigned to, and shared with, the United States European 
        Command; and
            (5) the United States Africa Command requires more 
        intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets to meet 
        the ``New Normal'' and general mission requirements in its area 
        of responsibility.
    (b) Report.--Not later than January 15, 2015, the Secretary of 
Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a report on the extent to which the ``New 
Normal'' requirements have changed the force posture and structure 
required of the United States Africa Command to meet the ``New Normal'' 
and general mission requirements in its area of responsibility.
    (c) Elements.--The report required by subsection (b) shall include 
the following:
            (1) A detailed description of the ``New Normal'' and 
        general mission requirements in the area of responsibility of 
        the United States Africa Command.
            (2) A description of any changes required for the United 
        States Africa Command to meet the ``New Normal'' and general 
        mission requirements in its area of responsibility, including 
        the gaps or shortfalls in capability, size, posture, 
        agreements, basing, and enabler support of all crisis response 
        forces and associated assets to access and defend posts that 
        are ``high risk, high threat'' posts.
            (3) An assessment of how the United States Africa Command 
        could employ permanently assigned military forces to support 
        all mission requirements of the United States Africa Command.
            (4) An estimate of the annual intelligence, surveillance, 
        and reconnaissance requirements of the United States Africa 
        Command and the shortfall, if any, in meeting such requirements 
        in fiscal year 2015.

SEC. 1264. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES PRESENCE AND COOPERATION 
              IN THE ARABIAN GULF REGION TO DETER IRAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should maintain a robust forward 
        presence and posture in order to support United States allies 
        and partners in the Arabian Gulf region, including Gulf 
        Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Israel, and to deter 
        Iran;
            (2) the United States should seek ways to support the 
        security posture of GCC countries in the Arabian Gulf region to 
        deter Iran;
            (3) key strategic United States bases in the Arabian Gulf 
        region that are used to deter Iran and would be used for any 
        military operations in the Arabian Gulf region are entirely 
        financed by funds for overseas contingency operations which is 
        an unsustainable approach;
            (4) such key strategic United States bases in the Arabian 
        Gulf region should be funded through the base budget of the 
        Department of Defense;
            (5) the United States does not have status of forces 
        agreements and defense agreements with key GCC allies, which 
        would support the defense of the Arabian Gulf region and would 
        deter Iran, and the United States should seek to complete these 
        agreements immediately;
            (6) the interim agreement with Iran relating to Iran's 
        nuclear program does not address key aspects of Iran's nuclear 
        program, including the possible military dimensions of Iran's 
        nuclear program;
            (7) a comprehensive agreement with Iran relating to Iran's 
        efforts to develop a nuclear weapons capability should address 
        past and present issues of concern of the United States, the 
        International Atomic Energy Agency, and the United Nations 
        Security Council;
            (8) the United States should continue to put significant 
        pressure on Iran's network of organizations that conduct malign 
        activities in the Arabian Gulf region, and around the globe, 
        even while the United States engages in negotiations with Iran 
        relating to Iran's nuclear program;
            (9) the United States Government should not enter into a 
        contract with any person or entity that is determined to have 
        violated United States sanctions laws with respect to 
        contracting with the Government of Iran and should encourage 
        United States allies, partners, and other countries to maintain 
        the same contracting standard; and
            (10) a comprehensive agreement with Iran relating to Iran's 
        efforts to develop or acquire a nuclear weapons capability 
        should be agreed to by the United States only if--
                    (A) Iran ceases the enrichment of uranium;
                    (B) Iran has ceased the pursuit, acquisition, and 
                development of, and has verifiably dismantled its 
                nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and ballistic 
                missiles and ballistic missile launch technology; and
                    (C) the Government of Iran has ceased providing 
                support for acts of international terrorism.

SEC. 1265. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MODERNIZATION OF DEFENSE CAPABILITIES 
              OF POLAND.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The efforts of Poland to modernize its defense 
        capabilities and restructure its armed forces have the 
        potential not only to enhance the national security of Poland 
        but also to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        (NATO).
            (2) The main priority of Poland with respect to such 
        efforts is to procure anti-aircraft and missile defense 
        systems.
            (3) At a time when most NATO allies are cutting defense 
        spending, Poland has maintained a steady defense budget and is 
        making significant investment in procurement of new defense 
        systems.
            (4) The United States should recognize the efforts of 
        Poland to modernize its defense capabilities and restructure 
        its armed forces and promote such efforts as a positive example 
        for other NATO allies to follow.
            (5) The United States has enjoyed a close cultural, 
        economic, political, and military relationship with Poland for 
        many years and the efforts of Poland to modernize its defense 
        capabilities and restructure its armed forces provide 
        opportunities for the two countries to work together even more 
        closely.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should seek to work with Poland to ensure 
        that, as part of the efforts of Poland to modernize its defense 
        capabilities and restructure its armed forces--
                    (A) Poland, to the maximum extent practicable, 
                procures defense systems that are interoperable with 
                NATO defense systems and will help fill critical NATO 
                shortfalls; and
                    (B) Poland, to the maximum extent practicable and 
                to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of 
                subparagraph (A), procures United States defense 
                systems that--
                            (i) will strengthen the bilateral, 
                        strategic partnership between the two 
                        countries;
                            (ii) will provide Poland with proven 
                        defense systems capabilities; and
                            (iii) promote deeper and closer bilateral 
                        cooperation between the two countries; and
            (2) the United States stands ready to assist Poland to 
        achieve its goals to modernize its defense capabilities and 
        restructure its armed forces.

SEC. 1266. REPORT ON ACCOUNTABILITY FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN 
              NIGERIA.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) strongly condemns the ongoing violence and the 
        systematic gross human rights violations against the people of 
        Nigeria carried out by the jihadist organization Boko Haram;
            (2) expresses its support for the people of Nigeria who 
        wish to live in a peaceful, economically prosperous, and 
        democratic Nigeria; and
            (3) calls on the President to support Nigerian and 
        International Community efforts to ensure accountability for 
        crimes against humanity committed by Boko Haram against the 
        people of Nigeria, particularly young girls kidnapped from 
        educational institutions by Boko Haram.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall 
        submit to Congress a report on crimes against humanity 
        committed by Boko Haram in Nigeria.
            (2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) 
        shall include the following elements:
                    (A) A description of initiatives undertaken by the 
                Department of Defense to assist the Government of 
                Nigeria to develop its own capacity to deploy 
                specialized police and army units rapidly to bring Boko 
                Haram leader Abubakar Shekau to justice and to prevent 
                and combat sectarian violence in cities and areas in 
                Nigeria where there has been a history of sectarian 
                violence.
                    (B) A description of violations of internationally 
                recognized human rights and crimes against humanity 
                perpetrated by Boko Haram in Nigeria, including a 
                description of the conventional and unconventional 
                weapons used for such crimes and, where possible, the 
                origins of the weapons.
                    (C) A description of efforts by the Department of 
                Defense to ensure accountability for violations of 
                internationally recognized human rights and crimes 
                against humanity perpetrated against the people of 
                Nigeria by Boko Haram and al-Qaeda affiliates and other 
                jihadists in Nigeria, including--
                            (i) a description of initiatives that the 
                        United States has undertaken to train Nigerian 
                        investigators on how to document, investigate, 
                        and develop findings of crimes against 
                        humanity; and
                            (ii) an assessment of the impact of those 
                        initiatives.

SEC. 1267. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NAVAL CAPABILITIES OF THE 
              RUSSIAN FEDERATION.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Mistral class amphibious assault warships, each of 
        which has the capacity to carry 16 helicopters, up to 700 
        soldiers, four landing craft, 60 armored vehicles, and 13 
        tanks, would significantly increase the naval capabilities of 
        the Russian navy;
            (2) Mistral class warships would allow the Russian navy to 
        expand its naval presence in the region, thereby augmenting its 
        capabilities against Ukraine, Georgia, and Baltic member states 
        of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;
            (3) France should not proceed with its sale of two Mistral 
        class warships to the Russian Federation; and
            (4) the President, the Secretary of State, and the 
        Secretary of Defense should use diplomatic means to urge their 
        counterparts in the Government of France not to proceed with 
        its sale of two Mistral class warships to the Russian 
        Federation.

SEC. 1268. REPORT ON COLLECTIVE AND NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF 
              CENTRAL ASIAN AND SOUTH CAUCASUS ENERGY DEVELOPMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Assured access to stable energy supplies is an enduring 
        concern of both the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO).
            (2) Adopted in Lisbon in November 2010, the new NATO 
        Strategic Concept declares that ``[s]ome NATO countries will 
        become more dependent on foreign energy suppliers and in some 
        cases, on foreign energy supply and distribution networks for 
        their energy needs''.
            (3) The report required by section 1233 of the National 
        Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-
        81) reaffirmed the Strategic Concept's assessment of growing 
        energy dependence of some members of the NATO alliance and also 
        noted there is value in the assured access, protection, and 
        delivery of energy.
            (4) Development of energy resources and transit routes in 
        the areas surrounding the Caspian Sea can diversify sources of 
        supply for members of the NATO alliance, particularly those in 
        Eastern Europe.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) Report.--Not later than 270 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of 
        Energy, submit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
        detailed report on the implications of new energy resource 
        development and distribution networks, both planned and under 
        construction, in the areas surrounding the Caspian Sea for 
        energy security strategies of the United States and NATO.
            (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall 
        include the following:
                    (A) An assessment of the dependence of NATO members 
                on a single oil or natural gas supplier or distribution 
                network.
                    (B) An assessment of the potential of energy 
                resources of the areas surrounding the Caspian Sea to 
                mitigate such dependence on a single supplier or 
                distribution network.
                    (C) Recommendations, if any, for ways in which the 
                United States can help support increased energy 
                security for NATO members.
            (3) Submission of classified information.--The report under 
        this subsection shall be submitted in unclassified form, but 
        may contain a classified annex.
    (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
            (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives; and
            (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Foreign Relations of the Senate.

SEC. 1269. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Protecting cultural property abroad is a vital part of 
        United States cultural diplomacy, showing the respect of the 
        United States for other cultures and the common heritage of 
        humanity.
            (2) Cultural property abroad has been lost, damaged, or 
        destroyed due to political instability, armed conflict, natural 
        disasters, and other threats.
            (3) In Egypt, political instability has led to the 
        ransacking of its museums, resulting in the destruction of 
        countless ancient artifacts that will forever leave gaps in 
        humanity's knowledge of the ancient Egyptian civilization.
            (4) In Syria, the ongoing civil war has resulted in the 
        shelling of medieval cities, damage to World Heritage Sites, 
        and the looting of museums and archaeological sites. 
        Archaeological and historic sites and artifacts in Syria date 
        back more than six millennia, and include some of the earliest 
        examples of writing.
            (5) In Mali, the Al-Qaeda-affiliated terrorist group Ansar 
        Dine destroyed tombs and shrines in the ancient city of 
        Timbuktu, once a major center for Islamic learning and 
        scholarship in the 15th and 16th centuries, and threatened 
        collections of ancient manuscripts.
            (6) In Afghanistan, the Taliban decreed that the Bamiyan 
        Buddhas, ancient statues carved into a cliff side in central 
        Afghanistan, were to be destroyed. In 2001 the Taliban carried 
        out their threat and destroyed the statues, leading to 
        worldwide condemnation.
            (7) In Iraq, after the fall of Saddam Hussein, thieves 
        looted the Iraq Museum in Bagdad, resulting in the loss of 
        approximately 15,000 items. These included ancient amulets, 
        sculptures, ivories, and cylinder seals. Many of these items 
        remain unrecovered.
            (8) The destruction of these and other cultural properties 
        represents an irreparable loss to humanity's common cultural 
        heritage, and therefore to all Americans.
            (9) The Armed Forces have played important roles in 
        preserving and protecting cultural property. On June 23, 1943, 
        President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the American 
        Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and 
        Historic Monuments in War Areas to provide expert advice to the 
        military on the protection of cultural property. The Commission 
        formed Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) teams which 
        became part of the Civil Affairs Division of Military 
        Government Section of the Allied armies. The individuals 
        serving in the MFAA were known as the ``Monuments Men'' and 
        have been credited with securing, cataloguing, and returning 
        hundreds of thousands works of art stolen by the Nazis during 
        World War II.
            (10) The United States Committee of the Blue Shield was 
        founded in 2006 to support the implementation of the 1954 Hague 
        Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event 
        of Armed Conflict, and to coordinate with the Armed Forces, 
        other branches of the United States Government, and other 
        cultural heritage nongovernmental organizations in preserving 
        cultural property abroad threatened by political instability, 
        armed conflict, or natural or other disasters.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Armed Forces play an important role in preserving 
        and protecting cultural property in countries at risk of 
        destruction due to political instability, armed conflict, or 
        natural or other disasters; and
            (2) the United States must protect cultural property abroad 
        pursuant to its obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention for 
        the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed 
        Conflict and customary international law in all conflicts to 
        which the United States is a party.
    (c) Report on Activities of the Department of Defense in Regards to 
Protecting Cultural Property Abroad.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
submit to the congressional defense committees and the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of 
the House of Representatives a report on efforts of the Department of 
Defense to protect cultural property abroad, including activities 
undertaken pursuant to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of 
Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, other cultural 
protection statutes, and international agreements, including--
            (1) directives, policies, and regulations the Department 
        has instituted to protect cultural property abroad at risk of 
        destruction due to political instability, armed conflict, or 
        natural or other disasters;
            (2) actions the Armed Forces have taken to protect cultural 
        property abroad, including efforts made to avoid damage, to the 
        extent possible, to cultural property through construction 
        activities, training to ensure deploying military personnel are 
        able to identify, avoid, and protect cultural property abroad, 
        and other efforts made to inform military personnel about the 
        protection of cultural property as part of the law of war; and
            (3) the status and number of specialist personnel in the 
        Armed Forces assigned to secure respect for cultural property 
        abroad and to cooperate with civilian authorities responsible 
        for safeguarding cultural property abroad, as required by 
        existing treaty obligations under Article 7 of the 1954 Hague 
        Convention.

SEC. 1270. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NIGERIA AND BOKO HARAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In recent years, Boko Haram has furthered violence and 
        instability in Nigeria and bordering countries.
            (2) The terrorist group known as ``Boko Haram,'' which 
        translates to ``Western education is forbidden,'' perpetrates 
        violent attacks in Nigeria and has grown in strength and 
        sophistication since its founding in 2002.
            (3) Boko Haram kidnapped over 200 female students on April 
        14, 2014, killed over 50 male students on February 25, 2014, 
        and continues to violently attack innocent civilians throughout 
        Nigeria.
            (4) Boko Haram has previously attacked Western interests, 
        bombing the United Nations building in Abuja on August 26, 
        2011, and was affiliated with taking Western hostages in Bauchi 
        on February 16, 2013, and later killing seven hostages.
            (5) As stated by United States Ambassador to Nigeria 
        Terrence P. McCulley in 2012, the threat of Boko Haram is 
        growing: ``We`ve seen an increase in sophistication, we've seen 
        increased lethality. We saw at least a part of the group has 
        decided it's in their interest to attack the international 
        community.''.
            (6) In June 2012, the Department of State added three 
        leaders of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, Abubakar Adam Kambar, 
        and Khalid al-Barnawi, to the Specially Designated Global 
        Terrorist list.
            (7) In November 2013, the Department of State designated 
        Boko Haram and its splinter group, Ansaru, as Foreign Terrorist 
        Organizations.
            (8) Boko Haram shares the ideological designs of al Qaeda, 
        and has made public pledges of support to Osama bin Laden, al-
        Qaeda, and al-Shabaab.
            (9) Boko Haram poses a broader threat to interests in 
        Nigeria, the Sahel, Europe, and the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--In light of the findings specified in 
subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of 
Defense should--
            (1) take appropriate action with allies and partners of the 
        United States to fight Boko Haram's violence and ideology;
            (2) partner with Nigeria's regional neighbors to counter 
        Boko Haram's cross-border activity and respond to emerging 
        threats; and
            (3) develop a long-term, interagency strategy to combat 
        Boko Haram and Ansaru, reassess United States assistance to 
        Nigeria, and brief Congress on this strategy.

SEC. 1271. RECOGNITION OF VICTIMS OF SOVIET COMMUNIST AND NAZI REGIMES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On August 13, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and 
        Prime Minister Winston Churchill issued a joint declaration 
        ``of certain common principles in the national policies of 
        their respective countries on which they based their hopes for 
        a better future for the world'' and ``the right of all peoples 
        to choose the form of government under which they will live and 
        self government restored to those who have been forcibly 
        deprived of them'' and that the people of countries may live in 
        freedom.
            (2) The United States Government has actively advocated for 
        and continues to support the principles of the United Nations 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations 
        General Assembly resolution 260 (III) of December 9, 1948.
            (3) Captive Nations Week, signed into law by President 
        Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959, raised public awareness of the 
        oppression of nations under the control of Communist and other 
        nondemocratic governments.
            (4) The European Parliament resolution on European 
        conscience and totalitarianism of April 2, 2009, and the 
        ``Black Ribbon Day'' resolution adopted by the Parliament of 
        Canada on November 30, 2009, establish a day of remembrance for 
        victims of Communist and Nazi regimes to remember and 
        commemorate their victims.
            (5) On the 70th anniversary of the formal adoption by the 
        Nazi leadership of the ``Final Solution of the Jewish 
        Problem'', members of the European Parliament and the national 
        parliaments of the European Union rejected attempts to 
        obfuscate the Holocaust by persons who sought to diminish the 
        uniqueness of the Holocaust by deeming the Holocaust to be 
        equal, similar, or equivalent to Communism.
            (6) Extreme forms of totalitarian rule have led to 
        premeditated and vast crimes committed against millions of 
        human beings and their basic and inalienable rights on a scale 
        unseen before in history.
            (7) The Nazi regime committed mass genocide during the 
        Holocaust, killing millions of Jews, political opponents, and 
        minority populations.
            (8) August 23 would be an appropriate date to designate as 
        ``Black Ribbon Day'' to remember and never forget the terror 
        millions of citizens in Central and Eastern Europe experienced 
        for more than 40 years by ruthless military, economic, and 
        political repression of the people through arbitrary 
        executions, mass arrests, deportations, the suppression of free 
        speech, confiscation of private property, and the destruction 
        of cultural and moral identity and civil society, all of which 
        deprived the vast majority of the peoples of Central and 
        Eastern Europe of their basic human rights and dignity, 
        separating them from the democratic world by means of the Iron 
        Curtain and the Berlin Wall.
            (9) The memories of Europe's tragic past cannot be 
        forgotten in order to honor the victims, condemn the 
        perpetrators, and lay the foundation for reconciliation based 
        on truth and remembrance.
    (b) Recognition.--Congress supports the designation of ``Black 
Ribbon Day'' to recognize the victims of Soviet Communist and Nazi 
regimes.

                production requirement, including the factors 
                considered in determining such requirement.
                    (B) An analysis of whether there are any changes to 
                such 50 to 80 secondaries per year production 
                requirement, including the reasons for any such

SEC. 1634. RETENTION OF MISSILE SILOS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the Sense of Congress that recent 
authorization and appropriations Acts passed by Congress and signed by 
the President have promulgated a national policy that it is in the 
national security interests of the United States to retain the maximum 
number of land-based strategic missile silos and their associated 
infrastructure to ensure that billions of dollars in prior taxpayer 
investments for such silos and infrastructure are not lost through 
precipitous actions which may be budget-driven, cyclical, and not in 
the long-term strategic interests of the United States.
    (b) Requirement.--The Secretary of Defense shall preserve each 
intercontinental ballistic missile silo that contains a deployed 
missile as of the date of the enactment of this Act in, at minimum, a 
warm status that enables such silo to--
            (1) remain a fully functioning element of the 
        interconnected and redundant command and control system of the 
        missile field; and
            (2) be made fully operational with a deployed missile.

SEC. 1635. CERTIFICATION ON NUCLEAR FORCE STRUCTURE.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in coordination with the 
Commander of the United States Strategic Command, shall certify to the 
congressional defense committees that the plan for implementation of 
the New START Treaty (as defined in section 494(a)(2)(D) of title 10, 
United States Code) announced on April 8, 2014, will enable the United 
States to meet its obligations under such treaty in a manner that 
ensures the nuclear forces of the United States--
            (1) are capable, survivable, and balanced; and
            (2) maintain strategic stability, deterrence and extended 
        deterrence, and allied assurance.

SEC. 1636. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY ON THE NUCLEAR TRIAD.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The April 2010 Nuclear Posture Review stated--
                    (A) ``After considering a wide range of possible 
                options for the U.S. strategic nuclear posture, 
                including some that involved eliminating a leg of the 
                Triad, the NPR concluded that for planned reductions 
                under New START, the United States should retain a 
                smaller Triad of SLBMs [submarine launched ballistic 
                missiles], ICBMs [intercontinental ballistic missiles], 
                and heavy bombers. Retaining all three Triad legs will 
                best maintain strategic stability at reasonable cost, 
                while hedging against potential technical problems or 
                vulnerabilities.'';
                    (B) ``ICBMs provide significant advantages to the 
                U.S. nuclear force posture, including extremely secure 
                command and control, high readiness rates, and 
                relatively low operating costs.'';
                    (C) ``a survivable U.S. response force requires 
                continuous at-sea deployments of SSBNs [ballistic 
                missile submarines] in both the Atlantic and Pacific 
                oceans, as well as the ability to surge additional 
                submarines in crisis.''; and
                    (D) nuclear-capable bombers--
                            (i) ``[provide] a rapid and effective hedge 
                        against technical challenges with another leg 
                        of the Triad, as well as geopolitical 
                        uncertainties''; and
                            (ii) ``are important to extended deterrence 
                        of potential attacks on U.S. allies and 
                        partners.''.
            (2) In a letter to the Senate on February 2, 2011, 
        regarding the New START Treaty, President Obama stated that ``I 
        intend to modernize or replace the triad of strategic nuclear 
        delivery systems: a heavy bomber and air- launched cruise 
        missile, an ICBM, and a nuclear-powered ballistic missile 
        submarine (SSBN) and SLBM.''.
            (3) In the Resolution Of Advice And Consent To Ratification 
        of the New START Treaty, the Senate stated that ``it is the 
        sense of the Senate that United States deterrence and 
        flexibility is assured by a robust triad of strategic delivery 
        vehicles. To this end, the United States is committed to 
        accomplishing the modernization and replacement of its 
        strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and to ensuring the 
        continued flexibility of United States conventional and nuclear 
        delivery systems.''.
            (4) On June 19, 2013, the Secretary of Defense, Chuck 
        Hagel, stated, ``First, the U.S. will maintain a ready and 
        credible deterrent. Second, we will retain a triad of bombers, 
        ICBMs, and ballistic missile submarines. Third, we will make 
        sure that our nuclear weapons remain safe, secure, ready and 
        effective.''.
            (5) Section 1062 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
        for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66; 10 U.S.C. 495 note) 
        states that--
                    (A) ``It is the policy of the United States to 
                modernize or replace the triad of strategic nuclear 
                delivery systems''; and
                    (B) ``Congress supports the modernization or 
                replacement of the triad of strategic nuclear delivery 
                systems consisting of a heavy bomber and air-launched 
                cruise missile, an intercontinental ballistic missile, 
                and a ballistic missile submarine and submarine 
                launched ballistic missile''.
            (6) On March 6, 2014, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
        Staff, General Martin Dempsey, testified to the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the House of Representatives that the Joint 
        Chiefs of Staff have determined that ``our recommendation is to 
        remain firmly committed to the triad, the three legs of the 
        nuclear capability, and that any further reduction should be 
        done only through negotiations, not unilaterally, and that we 
        should commit to modernizing the stockpile while we have it.''.
            (7) On April 2, 2014, the Commander of United States 
        Strategic Command, Admiral Cecil Haney, testified to the 
        Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives 
        that ``First and foremost, I think it is important that we as a 
        country realize just how important and foundational our 
        strategic deterrent is today for us and well into the future. 
        As you have mentioned, there is a need for modernization in a 
        variety of areas. When you look at the credible strategic 
        deterrent we have today, that includes everything from the 
        indications and warning, to the command and control and 
        communication structure that goes all the way from the 
        President down to the units, and to what frequently we talk 
        about as the triad involving the intercontinental ballistic 
        missiles, the submarines, and the bombers--each providing its 
        unique aspect of deterrence.''.
            (8) In the June 2013 Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy 
        of the United States required by section 491 of title 10, 
        United States Code, the Secretary of Defense, on behalf of the 
        President, stated that ``the United States will maintain a 
        nuclear Triad, consisting of ICBMs, SLBMs, and nuclear-capable 
        heavy bombers. Retaining all three Triad legs will best 
        maintain strategic stability at reasonable cost, while hedging 
        against potential technical problems or vulnerabilities. These 
        forces should be operated on a day-to-day basis in a manner 
        that maintains strategic stability with Russia and China, 
        deters potential regional adversaries, and assures U.S. Allies 
        and partners.''.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to operate, sustain, and modernize or replace the triad 
        of strategic nuclear delivery systems consisting of--
                    (A) heavy bombers equipped with nuclear gravity 
                bombs and air-launched nuclear cruise missiles;
                    (B) land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles 
                equipped with nuclear warheads that are capable of 
                carrying multiple independently targetable reentry 
                vehicles; and
                    (C) ballistic missile submarines equipped with 
                submarine launched ballistic missiles and multiple 
                nuclear warheads.
            (2) to operate, sustain, and modernize or replace a 
        capability to forward-deploy nuclear weapons and dual-capable 
        fighter-bomber aircraft;
            (3) to deter potential adversaries and assure allies and 
        partners of the United States through strong and long-term 
        commitment to the nuclear deterrent of the United States and 
        the personnel, systems, and infrastructure that comprise such 
        deterrent; and
            (4) to ensure the members of the Armed Forces that operate 
        the nuclear deterrent of the United States have the training, 
        resources, and national support required to execute the 
        critical national security mission of the members.

SEC. 1641. THEATER AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE OF ALLIES OF THE UNITED 
              STATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) A Patriot battery of the United States providing a 
        short-range air and missile defense capability has previously 
        been rotationally deployed to Poland, pursuant to an agreement 
        between the United States and the Government of Poland, during 
        a period occurring between 2010 to 2012.
            (2) The deployment of the Patriot battery did not include

SEC. 1644. PLAN TO COUNTER CERTAIN GROUND-LAUNCHED BALLISTIC MISSILES 
              AND CRUISE MISSILES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On March 5, 2014, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
        Defense for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy testified before 
        the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that ``[w]e are 
        concerned about Russian activity that appears to be 
        inconsistent with the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. 
        We've raised the issue with Russia. They provided an answer 
        that was not satisfactory to us, and we will, we told them that 
        the issue is not closed, and we will continue to raise this.'' 
        Congress shares this concern regarding Russian behavior that is 
        ``inconsistent with'' or in violation or circumvention of the 
        INF Treaty.
            (2) The Commander of the United States European Command, 
        and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, stated on April 2, 2014, 
        that ``a weapon capability that violates the INF, that is 
        introduced into the greater European land mass is absolutely a 
        tool that will have to be dealt with * * * I would not judge 
        how the alliance will choose to react, but I would say they 
        will have to consider what to do about it * * * It can't go 
        unanswered.''.
            (3) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency stated on 
        March 25, 2014, that Aegis Ashore missile defense sites, 
        including those to be deployed in the Republic of Poland and 
        the Republic of Romania, could be reconfigured to deal with the 
        threat of intermediate-range ground launched cruise missiles 
        with modest changes to ``the software, [and] with a minor 
        hardware addition.''.
            (4) The ``Report on Conventional Prompt Global Strike 
        Options if Exempt from the Restrictions of the Intermediate-
        Range Nuclear Forces Treaty Between the United States of 
        America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'' provided 
        to the Committee on Armed Services of the House of 
        Representatives in September 2013 by the Chairman of the Joint 
        Chiefs of Staff stated, ``[i]n the absence of the INF Treaty, 
        four types of weapons systems could assist in closing the 
        existing JROC-validated capability gap: (1) Modifications to 
        existing short range or tactical weapon systems to extend 
        range; (2) Forward-based, ground-launched cruise missiles 
        (GLCMs); (3) Forward-based, ground-launched intermediate-range 
        ballistic missiles (IRBMs); and (4) Forward-based, ground-
        launched intermediate-range missiles with trajectory shaping 
        vehicles (TSVs).''.
            (5) The report further stated that, ``[b]ecause of INF 
        restrictions, examination of prohibited concepts has not been 
        performed by industry or the Services. Trade studies regarding 
        capability, affordability, and development timelines would have 
        to be completed prior to providing an accurate estimate of 
        cost, technology risk, and timeline advantages that could be 
        achieved with respect to these concepts. Extensive knowledge 
        could be leveraged from past and current land- and sea-based 
        systems to assist in potential development and deployment of 
        these currently prohibited concepts.''.
            (6) President Obama stated in Prague in April 2009 that 
        ``Rules must be binding. Violations must be punished. Words 
        must mean something.''.
            (7) The Nuclear Posture Review of 2010 stated, ``it is not 
        enough to detect non-compliance; violators must know that they 
        will face consequences when they are caught.''.
            (8) The July 2010 Verifiability Assessment released by the 
        Department of State on the New START Treaty, and as quoted in a 
        hearing of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, 
        stated: ``[t]he costs and risks of Russian cheating or 
        breakout, on the other hand, would likely be very significant'' 
        and that the Russian Federation would be unlikely to cheat 
        because of the ``financial and international political costs of 
        such an action.''.
    (b) Plan for Testing of Aegis Ashore.--
            (1) In general.--The Director of the Missile Defense Agency 
        shall develop a plan to test, by not later than December 31, 
        2015, the capability of the Aegis Ashore system, including 
        pursuant to any appropriate modifications to the hardware or 
        software of such system, to counter intermediate-range ground 
        launched cruise missiles.
            (2) Submission.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Director shall submit to the 
        congressional defense committees the plan under paragraph (1), 
        including, if determined appropriate by the Director, whether 
        the Director determines that such plan should be implemented.
    (c) Plan to Develop Certain Ground-launched Ballistic Missiles and 
Cruise Missiles.--If, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Russian Federation is not in complete and verifiable compliance with 
its obligations under the INF Treaty, the Secretary of Defense shall--
            (1) develop a plan for the research and development of 
        intermediate range ballistic and cruise missiles, including 
        through trade studies regarding capability, affordability, and 
        development timelines, for which there are validated military 
        requirements; and
            (2) by not later than 120 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, submit to the congressional defense 
        committees the plan developed under paragraph (1), including, 
        if determined appropriate by the Secretary, whether the 
        Secretary determines that such plan should be implemented.
    (d) INF Treaty Defined.--The term ``INF Treaty'' means the Treaty 
Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-
Range Missiles, commonly referred to as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear 
Forces (INF) Treaty, signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and entered 
into force June 1, 1988.

        that the ground-based midcourse missile defense system will 
        perform reliably and effectively under realistic operational 
        conditions, including an explanation of the degree of 
        confidence supporting such assessment.
            (2) An assessment of whether the currently planned testing 
        program, if implemented, is sufficient to establish that the 
        ground-based midcourse missile defense system will perform both 
        reliably and effectively against current and plausible near- 
        and medium-term ballistic missile threats under realistic 
        operational conditions, and if any gaps are identified, an 
        evaluation of what improvements could be made to the testing 
        program to achieve reasonable confidence that the system would 
        be reliable and effective under realistic operational 
        conditions.
            (3) Any necessary recommendations to improve the 
        effectiveness and reliability of the ground-based midcourse 
        missile defense system.

        available for national defense purposes during such period. One 
        force-structure plan shall reflect the 2014 Quadrennial Defense 
        Review and the other force-structure plan shall reflect the 
        Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2

Secretary of Defense shall prepare (and include as part of the 
submission of such plans and inventory) the following:
            (1) A description of the infrastructure necessary to 
        support the force structure described in each force-structure 
        plan.
            (2) A discussion of categories of excess infrastructure and 
        infrastructure capacity, and the Secretary's targets for the 
        reduction of such excess capacity.
            (3) An assessment of the excess infrastructure and the 
        value of retaining certain excess infrastructure to support 
        surge or reversibility requirements.
            (4) An economic analysis of the effect of the closure or 
        realignment of military installations to reduce excess 
        infrastructure.
    (c) Special Considerations.--In determining the level of necessary 
versus excess infrastructure under subsection (b), the Secretary of 
Defense shall consider the following:
            (1) The anticipated continuing need for and availability of 
        military installations outside the United States, taking into 
        account current restrictions on the use of military 
        installations outside the United States and the potential for 
        future prohibitions or restrictions on the use of such military 
        installations.
            (2) Any efficiencies that may be gained from joint tenancy 
        by more than one branch of the Armed Forces at a military 
        installation or the reorganization or association of two or 
        more military installations as a single military installation.
    (d) Certification of Need for Further Closures and Realignments.--
            (1) Certification required.--On the basis of the force-
        structure plans and infrastructure inventory prepared under 
        subsection (a) and the descriptions and economic analysis 
        prepared under subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense shall 
        include as part of the submission of the plans and inventory a

SEC. 2864. DESIGNATION OF DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS NATIONAL MEMORIAL 
              IN RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The most reliable statistics regarding the number of 
        members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the 
        Distinguished Flying Cross indicate that 126,318 members of the 
        Armed Forces received the medal during World War II, 
        approximately 21,000 members received the medal during the 
        Korean conflict, and 21,647 members received the medal during 
        the Vietnam War. Since the end of the Vietnam War, more than 
        203 Armed Forces members have received the medal in times of 
        conflict.
            (2) The National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, 
        Missouri, burned down in 1973, and thus many more recipients of 
        the Distinguished Flying Cross may be undocumented. Currently, 
        the Department of Defense continues to locate and identify 
        members of the Armed Forces who have received the medal and are 
        undocumented.
            (3) The United States currently lacks a national memorial 
        dedicated to the bravery and sacrifice of those members of the 
        Armed Forces who have distinguished themselves by heroic deeds 
        performed in aerial flight.
            (4) An appropriate memorial to current and former members 
        of the Armed Forces is under construction at March Field Air 
        Museum in Riverside, California.
            (5) This memorial will honor all those members of the Armed 
        Forces who have distinguished themselves in aerial flight, 
        whether documentation of such members who earned the 
        Distinguished Flying Cross exists or not.
    (b) Designation.--The memorial to members of the Armed Forces who 
have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, located at March 
Field Air Museum in Riverside, California, is hereby designated as the 
Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial.
    (c) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial designated by 
this section is not a unit of the National Park System, and the 
designation of the national memorial shall not be construed to require 
or permit Federal funds to be expended for any purpose related to the 
national memorial.

        Replacement Project undermines national security and 
        jeopardizes the long-term credibility of the nuclear deterrent;
            (3) the April 8, 2014, testimony of the Acting 
        Administrator for Nuclear Security that ``close to half'' of 
        the $1,200,000,000 taxpayers have spent on the design of such 
        project has been wasted is a grievous misuse of limited 
        taxpayer funds, and the appropriate officials of the Federal 
        Government and contractors must be held accountable;
            (4) the uranium capabilities and modern infrastructure that 
        are to be provided by all three phases of the Uranium 
        Capabilities Replacement Project are critical to national 
        security and Congress fully supports efforts to deliver all of 
        these capabilities efficiently and expeditiously;
            (5) focused attention and robust leadership from the 
        highest levels of the executive branch and Congress are 
        required to ensure that such project delivers such critical 
        national security capabilities; and
            (6) the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator for 
        Nuclear Security must ensure that lines of responsibility, 
        authority, and accountability for such project are clear going 
        forward.
    (b) Cost and Oversight of Project.--Section 3123 of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law 112-239; 126

SEC. 3114. PLUTONIUM PIT PRODUCTION CAPACITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2008, the Department of Defense and the Department 
        of Energy, acting through the Nuclear Weapons Council 
        established by section 179 of title 10, United States Code, 
        agreed on a strategy to balance cost, risk, and stockpile needs 
        and established the requirement for the Department of Energy to 
        produce 50 to 80 plutonium pits per year.
            (2) In a memorandum of agreement dated May 3, 2010, entered 
        into by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy, 
        the Secretaries agreed that the Department of Energy would 
        achieve a minimum pit production capacity of 50 to 80 pits per 
        year by 2022.
            (3) The current plans of the Secretary of Energy would 
        achieve a pit production capacity of 50 to 80 pits per year by 
        2031, resulting in a delay of nearly a decade as compared to 
        the agreement described in paragraph (2).
            (4) In a report dated January 14, 2014, that the Secretary 
        of Defense submitted to Congress, the Secretary stated that 
        ``the Department of Defense has revalidated its requirement for 
        50 - 80 pits per year based on the demands of stockpile 
        modernization, the commitments to a modern physical 
        infrastructure, and the ability to hedge against technical 
        failure or geopolitical risk.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the requirement to create a modern, responsive nuclear 
        infrastructure that includes the capability and capacity to 
        produce, at minimum, 50 to 80 pits per year, is a national 
        security priority;
            (2) delaying creation of a modern, responsive nuclear 
        infrastructure until the 2030s is an unacceptable risk to the 
        nuclear deterrent and the national security of the United 
        States; and
            (3) timelines for creating certain capacities for 
        production of plutonium pits and other nuclear weapons 
        components must be driven by the requirement to hedge against 
        technical and geopolitical risk and not solely by the needs of 
        life extension programs.
    (c) Pit Production.--
            (1) In general.--Title XLII of the Atomic Energy Defense 
        Act (50 U.S.C. 2521 et seq.) is amended by inserting after the 
        item relating to section 4218 the following new section:

``SEC. 4219. PLUTONIUM PIT PRODUCTION CAPACITY.

    ``(a) Requirement.--Consistent with the requirements of the 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy shall ensure that the 
nuclear security enterprise--
            ``(1) during 2023, produces not less than 30 war reserve 
        plutonium pits;
            ``(2) during 2026, produces not less than 50 war reserve 
        plutonium pits; and
            ``(3) during a pilot period of not less than 90 days during 
        2027, demonstrates the capability to produce war reserve 
        plutonium pits at a rate sufficient to produce 80 pits per 
        year.
    ``(b) Annual Certification.--Not later than March 1, 2015, and each 
year thereafter through 2027, the Secretary shall certify to the 
congressional defense committees and the Secretary of Defense that the 
programs and budget of the Secretary will enable the nuclear security 
enterprise to meet the requirements under subsection (a).
    ``(c) Plan.--If the Secretary does not make a certification by 
March 1 of any year in which a certification is required under 
subsection (b), by not later than May 1 of such year, the Chairman of 
the Nuclear Weapons Council shall submit to the congressional defense 
committees a plan to enable the nuclear security enterprise to meet the 
requirements under subsection (b). Such plan shall include 
identification of the resources of the Department of Energy that the 
Chairman determines should be redirected to support the plan to meet 
such requirements.''.
            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of contents for the 
        Atomic Energy Defense Act is amended by inserting after the 
        item relating to section 4218 the following new item:

``Sec. 4219. Plutonium pit production capacity.''.

SEC. 3115. DEFINITION OF BASELINE AND THRESHOLD FOR STOCKPILE LIFE

        following new sentence: ``In addition to the requirement under 
        subparagraph (B), the cost and schedule baseline of a nuclear 
        stockpile life extension project established under this 
        subparagraph shall be the cost and schedule as determined by 
        the weapon design and cost report required prior to the project 
        entering into the development engineering phase.''; and
            (2) in subsection (b)(2), by striking ``200'' and inserting 
        ``150''.

shall not be treated as merchandise for purposes of section 55102 of 
title 46, United States Code.
    (b) Limitation.--If DD-17 (formerly known as USN-YFD-17) is sold

SEC. 3503. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ROLE OF DOMESTIC MARITIME INDUSTRY 
              IN NATIONAL SECURITY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States domestic maritime industry carries 
        hundreds of million of tons of cargo annually, supports nearly 
        500,000 jobs, and provides nearly 100 billion in annual 
        economic output;
            (2) the Nation's military sealift capacity will benefit 
        from one of the fastest growing segments of the domestic 
        trades, 14 domestic trade tankers that are on order to be 
        constructed at United States shipyards as of February 1, 2014;
            (3) the domestic trades' vessel innovations that 
        transformed worldwide maritime commerce include the development 
        of containerships, self-unloading vessels, articulated tug-
        barges, trailer barges, chemical parcel tankers, railroad-on-
        barge carfloats, and river flotilla towing systems;
            (4) the national security benefits of the domestic maritime 
        industry are unquestioned as the Department of Defense depends 
        on United States domestic trades' fleet of container ships, 
        roll-on/roll-off ships, and product tankers to carry military 
        cargoes;
            (5) the Department of Defense benefits from a robust 
        commercial shipyard and ship repair industry and current growth 
        in that sector is particularly important as Federal budget cuts 
        may reduce the number of new constructed military vessels; and
            (6) the domestic fleet is essential to national security 
        and was a primary source of mariners needed to crew United 
        States Government-owned sealift vessels activated from reserve 
        status during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom in 
        the period 2002 through 2010.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that United 
States coastwise trade laws promote a strong domestic trade maritime 
industry, which supports the national security and economic vitality of 
the United States and the efficient operation of the United States 
transportation system.

                       DIVISION D--FUNDING TABLES
