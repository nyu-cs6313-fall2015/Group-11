Extends the Medicare durable medical equipment (DME) face-to-face encounter documentation requirement to include physician assistants, practitioners, or specialists as well as physicians (as under current law).

Requires each Medicare administrative contractor to establish an improper payment outreach and education program for service providers and suppliers in order to reduce improper Medicare payments.

Gives Medicare beneficiaries the option to receive the Medicare Summary Notice (explanation of benefits) electronically.

Directs the Secretary to: (1) apply competitive procedures to selection of a Medicare administrative contractor at least once every 10 years (currently once every 5 years); and (3) study and, as appropriate, specify incentives for states to work with the Secretary under the Medicare-Medicaid Data Match Program to protect the federal and state share of expenditures.

Authorizes a PDP sponsor to establish a drug management program for at-risk beneficiaries.

Directs the Secretary to authorize Medicare drug integrity contractors (MEDICs) to accept directly an individual's prescription and necessary medical records from pharmacies, prescription drug plans, and physicians in order for MEDICs to provide information relevant to determining whether the individual is an at-risk beneficiary.

Directs the Secretary to issue a clarification or modification with respect to the application of the Common Rule (governing the protection of human subjects in research) to activities involving clinical data registries.

Amends SSA title XI to eliminate civil monetary penalties for inducements to physicians to limit services that are not medically necessary.

Modifies the Medicare home health surety bond condition of participation requirement.
