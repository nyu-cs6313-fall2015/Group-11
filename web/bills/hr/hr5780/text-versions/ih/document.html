            (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) 
        shall apply to payments made on or after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act.
    (b) Gainsharing Study and Report.--Not later than 12 months after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, in consultation with the Inspector General of the 
Department of Health and Human Services, shall submit to Congress a 
report with options for amending existing fraud and abuse laws in, and 
regulations related to, titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), through exceptions, safe harbors, or other 
narrowly targeted provisions, to permit gainsharing arrangements that 
otherwise would be subject to the civil money penalties described in 
paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1128A(b) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 
1320a-7a(b)), or similar arrangements between physicians and hospitals, 
and that improve care while reducing waste and increasing efficiency. 
The report shall--

        ownership interests, compensation arrangements, or other 
        relationships;
            (2) describe how the recommendations address 
        accountability, transparency, and quality, including how best 
        to limit inducements to stint on care, discharge patients 
        prematurely, or otherwise reduce or limit medically necessary 
        care; and
            (3) consider whether a portion of any savings generated by 
        such arrangements (as compared to an historical benchmark or 
        other metric specified by the Secretary to determine the impact 
        of delivery and payment system changes under such title XVIII
