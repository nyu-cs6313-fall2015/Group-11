SECTION 1. REPORT ON PROCUREMENT SUPPLY CHAIN VULNERABILITIES.

    (a) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives a report on how sole source suppliers of components to

industrial shock, financial crisis, or geopolitical crisis, such as an 
embargo of key raw materials or industrial inputs.
    (b) Matters Covered.--The report required by subsection (a) shall 
include, at a minimum, the following:
            (1) A list of the components in the Department of Defense 
        procurement supply chain for which there is a supplier that 
        controls over 50 percent of the global market.
            (2) A list of parts of the supply chain where there is 
        inadequate information to ascertain whether there is a single 
        source supplier of components.
            (3) The Secretary's recommendations on which single source 
        suppliers create vulnerabilities, as well as recommendations on 
        how to reduce those vulnerabilities.
    (c) Form of Report.--The report required by subsection (a) may be 
classified.
