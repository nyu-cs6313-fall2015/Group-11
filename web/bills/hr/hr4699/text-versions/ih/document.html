                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Native American Business Development, Trade Promotion, and 
Tourism Act of 2000 to require the Secretary of Commerce to prepare and 
    submit to Congress a report and recommendations to promote the 
   sustained economic development of Indian tribes and Indian lands.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Country Economic 
Revitalization Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2000, the Native American Business Development, 
        Trade Promotion, and Tourism Act (Public Law 106-464; 25 U.S.C. 
        4301 et seq.) identified the need for the Federal Government to 
        promote long-range economic development of Indian lands.
            (2) This law established within the Department of Commerce 
        an office to coordinate Federal programs related to Indian 
        economic development, promote the international trade and 
        export of Indian goods and services, and conduct intertribal 
        tourism demonstration projects.
            (3) To have additional impact, this law should be amended 
        to expand Federal support for the economic development of 
        Indian tribes and Indian lands.
            (4) Recent fiscal priorities of the Federal Government have 
        negatively impacted Indian tribes as well as others due to 
        their dependence upon Federal funds.
            (5) The Federal Government has a trust responsibility to 
        Indian tribes and should support tribal-owned enterprises and 
        Indian-owned businesses by preparing recommendations for 
        Congress on improved statutory measures that support the 
        development of sustainable tribal economies.

SEC. 3. REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS ON TRIBAL ECONOMIC 
              DEVELOPMENT.

    The Native American Business Development, Trade Promotion, and 
Tourism Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-464; 25 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) is 
amended--
            (1) by redesignating section 8 as section 9; and
            (2) by inserting after section 7 the following new section:
