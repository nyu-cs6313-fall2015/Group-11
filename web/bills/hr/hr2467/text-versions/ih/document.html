                from theft the locatable minerals, concentrates or 
                products derived therefrom which are produced or stored 
                on a mining claim, and such provisions shall conform 
                with such minimum standards as the Secretary may 
                prescribe by rule, taking into account the variety of 
                circumstances on mining claims; and
                    (B) not later than the 5th business day after 
                production begins anywhere on a mining claim, or 
                production resumes after more than 90 days after 
                production was suspended, notify the Secretary, in the 
                manner prescribed by the Secretary, of the date on 
                which such production has begun or resumed.
            (4) The Secretary may by rule require any person engaged in 
        transporting a locatable mineral, concentrate, or product 
        derived there from to carry on his or her person, in his or her 
        vehicle, or in his or her immediate control, documentation 
        showing, at a minimum, the amount, origin, and intended 
        destination of the locatable mineral, concentrate, or product 
        derived there from in such circumstances as the Secretary 
        determines is appropriate.
    (c) Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements.--
            (1) A claim holder, operator, or other person directly 
        involved in developing, producing, processing, transporting, 
        purchasing, or selling locatable minerals, concentrates, or 
        products derived therefrom, subject to this title, through the 
        point of royalty computation shall establish and maintain any 
        records, make any reports, and provide any information that the 
        Secretary may reasonably require for the purposes of 
        implementing this section or determining compliance with rules 
        or orders under this section. Such records shall include, but 
        not be limited to, periodic reports, records, documents, and 
        other data. Such reports may also include, but not be limited 
        to, pertinent technical and financial data relating to the 
        quantity, quality, composition volume, weight, and assay of all 
        minerals extracted from the mining claim. Upon the request of 
        any officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary 
        conducting an audit or investigation pursuant to this section, 
        the appropriate records, reports, or information that may be 
        required by this section shall be made available for inspection 
        and duplication by such officer or employee. Failure by a claim 
        holder, operator, or other person referred to in the first 
        sentence to cooperate with such an audit, provide data required 
        by the Secretary, or grant access to information may, at the 
        discretion of the Secretary, result in involuntary forfeiture 
        of the claim.
            (2) Records required by the Secretary under this section 
        shall be maintained for 7 years after release of financial 
        assurance under section 136 unless the Secretary notifies the 
        operator that the Secretary has initiated an audit or 
        investigation involving such records and that such records must 
        be maintained for a longer period. In any case when an audit or 
        investigation is underway, records shall be maintained until 
        the Secretary releases the operator of the obligation to 
        maintain such records.
    (d) Audits.--The Secretary is authorized to conduct such audits of 
all claim holders, operators, transporters, purchasers, processors, or 
other persons directly or indirectly involved in the production or 
sales of minerals covered by this title, as the Secretary deems 
necessary for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the requirements 
of this section. For purposes of performing such audits, the Secretary 
shall, at reasonable times and upon request, have access to, and may 
copy, all books, papers and other documents that relate to compliance 
with any provision of this section by any person.
    (e) Cooperative Agreements.--
            (1) The Secretary is authorized to enter into cooperative 
        agreements with the Secretary of Agriculture to share 
        information concerning the royalty management of locatable 
        minerals, concentrates, or products derived therefrom, to carry 
        out inspection, auditing, investigation, or enforcement (not 
        including the collection of royalties, civil or criminal 
        penalties, or other payments) activities under this section in 
        cooperation with the Secretary, and to carry out any other 
        activity described in this section.
            (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3)(A) of this 
        subsection (relating to trade secrets), and pursuant to a 
        cooperative agreement, the Secretary of Agriculture shall, upon 
        request, have access to all royalty accounting information in 
        the possession of the Secretary respecting the production, 
        removal, or sale of locatable minerals, concentrates, or 
        products derived therefrom from claims on lands open to 
        location under this title.
            (3) Trade secrets, proprietary, and other confidential 
        information protected from disclosure under section 552 of 
        title 5, United States Code, popularly known as the Freedom of 
        Information Act, shall be made available by the Secretary to 
        other Federal agencies as necessary to assure compliance with 
        this title and other Federal laws. The Secretary, the Secretary 
        of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency, and other Federal officials shall ensure 
        that such information is provided protection in accordance with 
        the requirements of that section.
    (f) Interest and Substantial Underreporting Assessments.--
            (1) In the case of mining claims where royalty payments are 
        not received by the Secretary on the date that such payments 
        are due, the Secretary shall charge interest on such 
        underpayments at the same interest rate as the rate applicable 
        under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
        In the case of an underpayment, interest shall be computed and 
        charged only on the amount of the deficiency and not on the 
        total amount.
            (2) If there is any underreporting of royalty owed on 
        production from a claim for any production month by any person 
        liable for royalty payments under this section, the Secretary 
        shall assess a penalty of not greater than 25 percent of the 
        amount of that underreporting.
            (3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term 
        ``underreporting'' means the difference between the royalty on 
        the value of the production that should have been reported and 
        the royalty on the value of the production which was reported, 
        if the value that should have been reported is greater than the 
        value that was reported.
            (4) The Secretary may waive or reduce the assessment 
        provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection if the person 
        liable for royalty payments under this section corrects the 
        underreporting before the date such person receives notice from 
        the Secretary that an underreporting may have occurred, or 
        before 90 days after the date of the enactment of this section, 
        whichever is later.
            (5) The Secretary shall waive any portion of an assessment 
        under paragraph (2) of this subsection attributable to that 
        portion of the underreporting for which the person responsible 
        for paying the royalty demonstrates that--
                    (A) such person had written authorization from the 
                Secretary to report royalty on the value of the 
                production on basis on which it was reported;
                    (B) such person had substantial authority for 
                reporting royalty on the value of the production on the 
                basis on which it was reported;
                    (C) such person previously had notified the 
                Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary may by rule 
                prescribe, of relevant reasons or facts affecting the 
                royalty treatment of specific production which led to 
                the underreporting; or
                    (D) such person meets any other exception which the 
                Secretary may, by rule, establish.
    (g) Expanded Royalty Obligations.--Each person liable for royalty 
payments under this section shall be jointly and severally liable for 
royalty on all locatable minerals, concentrates, or products derived 
therefrom lost or wasted from a mining claim located under the general 
mining laws and maintained in compliance with this title when such loss 
or waste is due to negligence on the part of any person or due to the 
failure to comply with any rule, regulation, or order issued under this 
section.
    (h) Gross Income From Mining Defined.--For the purposes of this 
section, for any locatable mineral, the term ``gross income from 
mining'' has the same meaning as the term ``gross income'' in section 
613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    (i) Effective Date.--The royalty under this section shall take 
effect with respect to the production of locatable minerals after the 
enactment of this Act, but any royalty payments attributable to 
production during the first 12 calendar months after the enactment of 
this Act shall be payable at the expiration of such 12-month period.
    (j) Failure To Comply With Royalty Requirements.--Any person who 
fails to comply with the requirements of this section or any regulation 
or order issued to implement this section shall be liable for a civil 
penalty under section 109 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management 
Act (30 U.S.C. 1719) to the same extent as if the claim located under 
the general mining laws and maintained in compliance with this title 
were a lease under that Act.
    (k) Use of Amounts for Deficit Reduction.--Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, any amounts received by the United States as 
royalties under this section shall be deposited in the Treasury and 
used for Federal budget deficit reduction or, if there is no Federal 
budget deficit, for reducing the Federal debt in such manner as the 
Secretary of the Treasury considers appropriate.

            (2)(A) The Secretary shall adjust the fees required by this 
        section to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index 
        published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department 
        of Labor every 5 years after the date of enactment of this Act, 
        or more frequently if the Secretary determines an adjustment to 
        be reasonable. The Secretary shall employ the Consumer Price 
        Index for All-Urban Consumers published by the Department of 
        Labor as the basis for adjustment, and rounding according to 
        the adjustment process of conditions of the Federal Civil 
        Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (104 Stat. 890).
            (B) The Secretary shall provide claimants notice of any 
        adjustment made under this paragraph not later than July 1 of 
        any year in which the adjustment is made.

        apply the calendar year following the calendar year in which it 
        is made.
    (b) Location.--Notwithstanding any provision of law, for every 
unpatented mining claim, mill or tunnel site located after the date of 
enactment of this Act the locator shall, at the time the location 
notice is recorded with the Bureau of Land Management, pay to the 
Secretary a location fee, in addition to the fee required by subsection 
(a) of $50 per claim.
    (c) Co-Ownership.--The co-ownership provisions of the Mining Law of 
1872 (30 U.S.C. 28 et seq.) will remain in effect except that the 
annual claim maintenance fee, where applicable, shall replace 
applicable assessment requirements and expenditures.
    (d) Failure To Pay.--Failure to pay the claim maintenance fee as 
required by subsection (a) shall conclusively constitute a forfeiture 
of the unpatented mining claim, mill or tunnel site by the claimant and 
the claim shall be deemed null and void by operation of law.
    (e) Other Requirements.--
            (1) Nothing in this section shall change or modify the 
        requirements of section 314(b) of the Federal Land Policy and 
        Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1744(b)), or the requirements 
        of section 314(c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act 
        of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1744(c)) related to filings required by 
        section 314(b), which remain in effect.
            (2) Section 2324 of the Revised Statutes of the United 
        States (30 U.S.C. 28) is amended by inserting ``or section 
        103(a) of the Mining Reform and Deficit Reduction Act of 2013'' 
        after ``Act of 1993,''.

                and wildlife resources and habitat contained thereon, 
                after the completion of mineral activities and final 
                reclamation, will conform to the land use plan 
                applicable to the area subject to mineral activities 
                and are returned to a productive use.
                    (D) The area subject to the proposed plan is open 
                to location for the types of mineral activities 
                proposed.
                    (E) The proposed operation has been designed to 
                prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance.
                    (F) The applicant will fully comply with the 
                requirements of section 136 (relating to financial 
                assurance) prior to the initiation of operations.
                    (G) Neither the applicant nor operator, nor any 
                subsidiary, affiliate, or person controlled by or under 
                common control with the applicant or operator, is 
                ineligible to receive a permit under section 135.
                    (H) The reclamation plan demonstrates that 10 years 
                following mine closure, no treatment of surface or 
                ground water will be required to meet water quality 
                standards at the point of discharge.
            (2) With respect to any activities specified in the 
        reclamation plan referred to in subsection (b) that constitutes 
        a removal or remedial action under section 101 of the 
        Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
        Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.), the Secretary 
        shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency prior to the issuance of an operations 
        permit. The Administrator shall ensure that the reclamation 
        plan does not require activities that would increase the costs 
        or likelihood of removal or remedial actions under the 
        Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
        Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) or corrective 
        actions under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et 
        seq.).
    (d) Term of Permit; Renewal.--
            (1) An operations permit--
                    (A) shall be for a term that is no longer than the

                            (i) the period necessary to accomplish the 
                        proposed mineral activities subject to the 
                        permit; and
                            (ii) 20 years; and
                    (B) shall be renewed for an additional 20-year 
                period if the operation is in compliance with the 
                requirements of this title and other applicable law.
            (2) Failure by the operator to commence mineral activities 
        within 2 years of the date scheduled in an operations permit 
        shall require a modification of the permit if the Secretary 
        concerned determines that modifications are necessary to comply 
        with section 121.
    (e) Permit Modification.--
            (1) During the term of an operations permit the operator 
        may submit an application to modify the permit (including the 
        operations plan or reclamation plan, or both).
            (2) The Secretary, or for National Forest System lands the 
        Secretary of Agriculture, may, at any time, require reasonable 
        modification to any operations plan or reclamation plan upon a 
        determination that the requirements of this title cannot be met 
        if the plan is followed as approved. Such determination shall 
        be based on a written finding and subject to public notice and 
        hearing requirements established by the Secretary concerned.
            (3) A permit modification is required before changes are 
        made to the approved plan of operations, or if unanticipated 
        events or conditions exist on the mine site, including in the 
        case of--
                    (A) development of acid or toxic drainage;
                    (B) loss of springs or water supplies;
                    (C) water quantity, water quality, or other 
                resulting water impacts that are significantly 
                different than those predicted in the application;
                    (D) the need for long-term water treatment;
                    (E) significant reclamation difficulties or 
                reclamation failure;
                    (F) the discovery of significant scientific, 
                cultural, or biological resources that were not 
                addressed in the original plan; or
                    (G) the discovery of hazards to public safety.
    (f) Temporary Cessation of Operations.--
            (1) An operator conducting mineral activities under an 
        operations permit in effect under this subtitle may not 
        temporarily cease mineral activities for a period greater than 
        180 days unless the Secretary concerned has approved such 
        temporary cessation or unless the temporary cessation is 
        permitted under the original permit. Any operator temporarily 
        ceasing mineral activities for a period greater than 90 days 
        under an operations permit issued before the date of the 
        enactment of this Act shall submit, before the expiration of 
        such 90-day period, a complete application for temporary 
        cessation of operations to the Secretary concerned for approval 
        unless the temporary cessation is permitted under the original 
        permit.
            (2) An application for approval of temporary cessation of 
        operations shall include such information required under 
        subsection (b) and any other provisions prescribed by the 
        Secretary concerned to minimize impacts on the environment. 
        After receipt of a complete application for temporary cessation 
        of operations such Secretary shall conduct an inspection of the 
        area for which temporary cessation of operations has been 
        requested.
            (3) To approve an application for temporary cessation of 
        operations, the Secretary concerned shall make each of the 
        following determinations:
                    (A) A determination that the methods for securing 
                surface facilities and restricting access to the permit 
                area, or relevant portions thereof, will effectively 
                ensure against hazards to the health and safety of the 
                public and fish and wildlife.
                    (B) A determination that reclamation is in 
                compliance with the approved reclamation plan, except 
                in those areas specifically designated in the 
                application for temporary cessation of operations for 
                which a delay in meeting such standards is necessary to 
                facilitate the resumption of operations.
                    (C) A determination that the amount of financial 
                assurance filed with the permit application is 
                sufficient to assure completion of the reclamation 
                activities identified in the approved reclamation plan 
                in the event of forfeiture.
                    (D) A determination that any outstanding notices of 
                violation and cessation orders incurred in connection 
                with the plan for which temporary cessation is being 
                requested are either stayed pursuant to an 
                administrative or judicial appeal proceeding or are in 
                the process of being abated to the satisfaction of the 
                Secretary concerned.

as the Secretary deems necessary to assure that mineral activities 
conform to the permit, including adjustment of financial assurance 
requirements.
    (h) Transfer, Assignment, or Sale of Rights.--
            (1) No transfer, assignment, or sale of rights granted by a 
        permit under this section shall be made without the prior 
        written approval of the Secretary, or for National Forest 
        System lands the Secretary of Agriculture.
            (2) The Secretary, or for National Forest System lands, the 
        Secretary of Agriculture, may allow a person holding a permit 
        to transfer, assign, or sell rights under the permit to a 
        successor, if such Secretary finds, in writing, that the 
        successor--
                    (A) has submitted information required and is 
                eligible to receive a permit in accordance with section 
                135;
                    (B) has submitted evidence of financial assurance 
                satisfactory under section 136; and
                    (C) meets any other requirements specified by such 
                Secretary.
            (3) The successor in interest shall assume reclamation and 
        other responsibilities established by the existing permit and 
        shall conduct the mineral activities in full compliance with 
        this title, and the terms and conditions of the permit as in

        or an equivalent form approved by such Secretary.
            (2) The financial assurance shall cover all lands within 
        the initial permit area and all affected waters that may 
        require restoration, treatment, or other management as a result 
        of mineral activities, and shall be extended to cover all lands 
        and waters added pursuant to any permit modification made under 
        section 133(f) (relating to exploration permits) or section 
        134(e) (relating to operations permits), or affected by mineral 
        activities.
    (b) Amount.--The amount of the financial assurance required under

reclamation and restoration satisfying the requirements of this title 
if the work were to be performed by the Secretary concerned in the 
event of forfeiture, including the construction and maintenance costs 
for any treatment facilities necessary to meet Federal and State 
environmental requirements. The calculation of such amount shall take 
into account the maximum level of financial exposure which shall arise 
during the mineral activity and administrative costs associated with a 
government agency reclaiming the site.
    (c) Duration.--The financial assurance required under this section 
shall be held for the duration of the mineral activities and for an 
additional period to cover the operator's responsibility for 
reclamation, restoration, and long-term maintenance, and effluent 
treatment as specified in subsection (g).
    (d) Adjustments.--The amount of the financial assurance and the 
terms of the acceptance of the assurance may be adjusted by the 
Secretary concerned from time to time as the area requiring coverage is 
increased or decreased, or where the costs of reclamation or treatment 
change, or pursuant to section 134(f) (relating to temporary cessation 
of operations), but the financial assurance shall otherwise be in 
compliance with this section. The Secretary concerned shall review the 
financial guarantee every 3 years and as part of the permit application 
review under section 134(c).
    (e) Release.--Upon request, and after notice and opportunity for 
public comment, and after inspection by the Secretary, or for National 
Forest System lands, the Secretary of Agriculture, such Secretary may, 
after consultation with the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, release in whole or in part the financial assurance 
required under this section if the Secretary makes both of the 
following determinations:
            (1) A determination that reclamation or restoration covered 
        by the financial assurance has been accomplished as required by 
        this title.
            (2) A determination that the terms and conditions of any 
        other applicable Federal requirements, and State requirements 
        applicable pursuant to cooperative agreements under section 
        138, have been fulfilled.
    (f) Release Schedule.--The release referred to in subsection (e) 
shall be according to the following schedule:
            (1) After the operator has completed any required 
        backfilling, regrading, and drainage control of an area subject 
        to mineral activities and covered by the financial assurance, 
        and has commenced revegetation on the regraded areas subject to 
        mineral activities in accordance with the approved plan, that 
        portion of the total financial assurance secured for the area 
        subject to mineral activities attributable to the completed 
        activities may be released except that sufficient assurance 
        must be retained to address other required reclamation and 
        restoration needs and to assure the long-term success of the 
        revegetation.
            (2) After the operator has completed successfully all 
        remaining mineral activities and reclamation activities and all 
        requirements of the operations plan and the reclamation plan, 
        and all other requirements of this title have been fully met, 
        including the requirements of subsection (g) of this section, 
        the remaining portion of the financial assurance may be 
        released.
During the period following release of the financial assurance as 
specified in paragraph (1), until the remaining portion of the 
financial assurance is released as provided in paragraph (2), the 
operator shall be required to comply with the permit issued under this 
subtitle.
    (g) Effluent.--Notwithstanding section 137(b)(4), where any 
discharge or other water-related condition resulting from the mineral 
activities requires treatment in order to meet the applicable effluent 
limitations and water quality standards, the financial assurance shall 
include the estimated cost of maintaining such treatment for the 
projected period that will be needed after the cessation of mineral 
activities. The portion of the financial assurance attributable to such 
estimated cost of treatment shall not be released until the discharge 
has ceased for a period of 5 years, as determined by ongoing monitoring 
and testing, or, if the discharge continues, until the operator has met 
all applicable effluent limitations and water quality standards for 5 
full years without treatment.
    (h) Environmental Hazards.--If the Secretary, or for National 
Forest System lands, the Secretary of Agriculture, determines, after 
final release of financial assurance, that an environmental hazard 
resulting from the mineral activities exists, or the terms and 
conditions of the explorations or operations permit of this title were 
not fulfilled in fact at the time of release, such Secretary shall 
issue an order under section 146 requiring the claim holder or operator 
(or any person who controls the claim holder or operator) to correct 
the condition such that applicable laws and regulations and any 
conditions from the plan of operations are met.

SEC. 137. OPERATION AND RECLAMATION.

    (a) General Rule.--
            (1) The operator shall restore lands subject to mineral 
        activities carried out under a permit issued under this 
        subtitle to a condition capable of supporting--
                    (A) the uses which such lands were capable of 
                supporting prior to surface disturbance by the 
                operator, or
                    (B) other beneficial uses which conform to 
                applicable land use plans as determined by the 
                Secretary, or for National Forest System lands, the 
                Secretary of Agriculture.
            (2) Reclamation shall proceed as contemporaneously as 
        practicable with the conduct of mineral activities. In the case 
        of a cessation of mineral activities beyond that provided for 
        as a temporary cessation under this title, reclamation 
        activities shall begin immediately.
    (b) Operation and Reclamation Standards.--The Secretary of the 
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall jointly promulgate 
regulations that establish operation and reclamation standards for 
mineral activities permitted under this title. The Secretaries may 
determine whether outcome-based performance standards or technology-
based design standards are most appropriate. The regulations shall 
address the following:
            (1) Segregation, protection, and replacement of topsoil or 
        other suitable growth medium, and the prevention, where 
        possible, of soil contamination.
            (2) Maintenance of the stability of all surface areas.
            (3) Control of sediments to prevent erosion and manage 
        drainage.
            (4) Minimization of the formation and migration of acidic, 
        alkaline, metal-bearing, or other deleterious leachate.
            (5) Reduction of the visual impact of mineral activities to 
        the surrounding topography, including as necessary pit 
        backfill.
            (6) Establishment of a diverse, effective, and permanent 
        vegetative cover of the same seasonal variety native to the 
        area affected by mineral activities, and equal in extent of 
        cover to the natural vegetation of the area.
            (7) Design and maintenance of leach operations, 
        impoundments, and excess waste according to standard 
        engineering standards to achieve and maintain stability and 
        reclamation of the site.
            (8) Removal of structures and roads and sealing of drill 
        holes.
            (9) Restoration of, or mitigation for, fish and wildlife

            (10) Preservation of cultural, paleontological, and cave 
        resources.
            (11) Prevention and suppression of fire in the area of 
        mineral activities.
    (c) Surface or Groundwater Withdrawals.--The Secretary shall work 
with State and local governments with authority over the allocation and 
use of surface and groundwater in the area around the mine site as 
necessary to ensure that any surface or groundwater withdrawals made as 
a result of mining activities approved under this section do not cause 
undue degradation or results in material alteration of the hydrologic 
balance.
    (d) Special Rule.--Reclamation activities for a mining claim that 
has been forfeited, relinquished, or lapsed, or a plan that has expired 
or been revoked or suspended, shall continue subject to review and 
approval by the Secretary, or for National Forest System lands the 
Secretary of Agriculture.

SEC. 138. STATE LAW AND REGULATION.

            (1) Any reclamation, land use, environmental, or public 
        health protection standard or requirement in State, county, 
        local, or tribal law or regulation that meets or exceeds the 
        requirements of this title shall not be construed to be 
        inconsistent with any such standard.
            (2) Any bonding standard or requirement in State, county, 
        local, or tribal law or regulation that meets or exceeds the 
        requirements of this title shall not be construed to be

        cooperative agreement with the State that sets forth a common 
        regulatory framework consistent with the requirements of this 
        title for the purposes of such plan of operations. Any such 
        common regulatory framework shall not negate the authority of 
        the Federal Government to independently inspect mines and 
        operations and bring enforcement actions for violations.
            (3) The Secretary concerned shall not enter into a 
        cooperative agreement with any State under this section until 
        after notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for public 
        comment and hearing.

            (1) The Secretary, or for National Forest System lands the 
        Secretary of Agriculture, shall make inspections of mineral 
        activities so as to ensure compliance with the requirements of 
        this title.
            (2) The Secretary concerned shall establish a frequency of 
        inspections for mineral activities conducted under a permit 
        issued under subtitle C, but in no event shall such inspection 
        frequency be less than one complete inspection per calendar 
        quarter or, two per calendar quarter in the case of a permit 
        for which the Secretary concerned approves an application under 
        section 134(f) (relating to temporary cessation of operations). 
        After revegetation has been established in accordance with a 
        reclamation plan, such Secretary shall conduct annually two 
        complete inspections. Such Secretary shall have the discretion 
        to modify the inspection frequency for mineral activities that 
        are conducted on a seasonal basis. Inspections shall continue 
        under this subsection until final release of financial

        Forest System lands the Secretary of Agriculture, shall 
        determine within 10 working days of receipt of the request 
        whether the request states a reason to believe that a violation 
        exists. If the person alleges and provides reason to believe 
        that an imminent threat to the environment or danger to the 
        health or safety of the public exists, the 10-day period shall 
        be waived and the inspection shall be conducted immediately. 
        The identity of the person supplying information to the 
        Secretary relating to a possible violation or imminent danger 
        or harm shall remain confidential with the Secretary if so 
        requested by that person.
            (B) The Secretaries shall, by joint rule, establish 
        procedures for the review of (i) any decision by an authorized 
        representative not to inspect; or (ii) any refusal by such 
        representative to ensure that remedial actions are taken with 
        respect to any alleged violation. The Secretary concerned shall 
        furnish such persons requesting the review a written statement 
        of the reasons for the Secretary's final disposition of the 
        case.
    (b) Monitoring.--
            (1) The Secretary, or for National Forest System lands the 
        Secretary of Agriculture, shall require all operators to 
        develop and maintain a monitoring and evaluation system that 
        shall identify compliance with all requirements of a permit 
        approved under this title. The Secretary concerned may require 
        additional monitoring to be conducted as necessary to assure 
        compliance with the reclamation and other environmental 
        standards of this title. Such plan must be reviewed and 
        approved by the Secretary and shall become a part of the 
        explorations or operations permit.
            (2) The operator shall file reports with the Secretary, or 
        for National Forest System lands the Secretary of Agriculture, 
        on a frequency determined by the Secretary concerned, on the 
        results of the monitoring and evaluation process, except that 
        if the monitoring and evaluation show a violation of the 
        requirements of a permit approved under this title, it shall be 
        reported immediately to the Secretary concerned. The Secretary 
        shall evaluate the reports submitted pursuant to this 
        paragraph, and based on those reports and any necessary 
        inspection shall take enforcement action pursuant to this 
        section. Such reports shall be maintained by the operator and 
        by the Secretary and shall be made available to the public.
            (3) The Secretary, or for National Forest System lands the 
        Secretary of Agriculture, shall determine what information 
        shall be reported by the operator pursuant to paragraph (2). A 
        failure to report as required by the Secretary concerned shall 
        constitute a violation of this title and subject the operator 
        to enforcement action pursuant to section 146.

SEC. 144. CITIZENS SUITS.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), any person

        judicially reviewable under any provision of law at any time 
        after such promulgation, issuance, or denial is final.
    (c) Venue.--Venue of all actions brought under this section shall 
be determined in accordance with section 1391 of title 28, United 
States Code.

        the decision.
            (D) Pending a review by the Secretary or resolution of an 
        administrative appeal, final decisions (except enforcement 
        actions under section 146) shall be stayed.
            (2) The Secretary concerned shall provide an opportunity 
        for a public hearing at the request of any party to the 
        proceeding as specified in paragraph (1). The filing of an 
        application for review under this subsection shall not operate 
        as a stay of any order or notice issued under section 146.
            (3) For any review proceeding under this subsection, the 
        Secretary concerned shall make findings of fact and shall issue 
        a written decision incorporating therein an order vacating, 
        affirming, modifying, or terminating the notice, order, or 
        decision, or with respect to an assessment, the amount of 
        penalty that is warranted.

        granting or denying such relief. The Secretary concerned may 
        grant such relief under such conditions as he or she may 
        prescribe only if such relief shall not adversely affect the 
        health or safety of the public or cause imminent environmental 
        harm to land, air, or water resources.
            (5) The availability of review under this subsection shall 
        not be construed to limit the operation of rights under section 
        144 (relating to citizen suits).
    (b) Costs.--Whenever a proceeding occurs under subsection (a), at 
the request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all 
costs and expenses (including attorney fees) as determined by the

incurred by such person for or in connection with participation in such 
proceedings, including any judicial review of the proceeding, may be 
assessed against either party as the court, in the case of judicial 
review, or the Secretary or Secretaries concerned in the case of 
administrative proceedings, deems proper if it is determined that such 
party prevailed in whole or in part, achieving some success on the 
merits, and that such party made a substantial contribution to a full 
and fair determination of the issues.

        concerned, or the authorized representative of such Secretary, 
        shall provide such person with a period of time not to exceed 
        30 days to abate the violation. Such period of time may be 
        extended by the Secretary concerned upon a showing of good 
        cause by such person. If, upon the expiration of time provided 
        for such abatement, the Secretary concerned, or the authorized 
        representative of such Secretary, finds that the violation has 
        not been abated he or she shall immediately order a cessation 
        of all mineral activities or the portion thereof relevant to 
        the violation.
            (2) If the Secretary concerned, or the authorized 
        representative of the Secretary concerned, determines that any 
        condition or practice exists, or that any person is in 
        violation of any requirement under a permit approved under this 
        title, and such condition, practice or violation is causing, or 
        can reasonably be expected to cause--
                    (A) an imminent danger to the health or safety of 
                the public; or
                    (B) significant, imminent environmental harm to 
                land, air, water, or fish or wildlife resources,
        such Secretary or authorized representative shall immediately 
        order a cessation of mineral activities or the portion thereof 
        relevant to the condition, practice, or violation.
            (3)(A) A cessation order pursuant to paragraphs (1) or (2) 
        shall remain in effect until such Secretary, or authorized 
        representative, determines that the condition, practice, or 
        violation has been abated, or until modified, vacated or 
        terminated by the Secretary or authorized representative. In 
        any such order, the Secretary or authorized representative 
        shall determine the steps necessary to abate the violation in 
        the most expeditious manner possible and shall include the 
        necessary measures in the order. The Secretary concerned shall 
        require appropriate financial assurances to ensure that the 
        abatement obligations are met.
            (B) Any notice or order issued pursuant to paragraphs (1) 
        or (2) may be modified, vacated, or terminated by the Secretary 
        concerned or an authorized representative of such Secretary. 
        Any person to whom any such notice or order is issued shall be 
        entitled to a hearing on the record.
            (4) If, after 30 days of the date of the order referred to 
        in paragraph (3)(A) the required abatement has not occurred, 
        the Secretary concerned shall take such alternative enforcement 
        action against the claim holder or operator (or any person who 
        controls the claim holder or operator) as will most likely 
        bring about abatement in the most expeditious manner possible. 
        Such alternative enforcement action may include, but is not 
        necessarily limited to, seeking appropriate injunctive relief 
        to bring about abatement. Nothing in this paragraph shall 
        preclude the Secretary, or for National Forest System lands the 
        Secretary of Agriculture, from taking alternative enforcement 
        action prior to the expiration of 30 days.

        controls the claim holder or operator) fails to abate a 
        violation or defaults on the terms of the permit, the 
        Secretary, or for National Forest System lands the Secretary of 
        Agriculture, shall forfeit the financial assurance for the plan 
        as necessary to ensure abatement and reclamation under this 
        title. The Secretary concerned may prescribe conditions under 
        which a surety may perform reclamation in accordance with the 
        approved plan in lieu of forfeiture.
            (6) The Secretary, or for National Forest System lands the 
        Secretary of Agriculture, shall not cause forfeiture of the 
        financial assurance while administrative or judicial review is 
        pending.
            (7) In the event of forfeiture, the claim holder, operator, 
        or any affiliate thereof, as appropriate as determined by the 
        Secretary by rule, shall be jointly and severally liable for 
        any remaining reclamation obligations under this title.
    (b) Compliance.--The Secretary, or for National Forest System lands 
the Secretary of Agriculture, may request the Attorney General to 
institute a civil action for relief, including a permanent or temporary 
injunction or restraining order, or any other appropriate enforcement 
order, including the imposition of civil penalties, in the district 
court of the United States for the district in which the mineral 
activities are located whenever a person--
            (1) violates, fails, or refuses to comply with any order 
        issued by the Secretary concerned under subsection (a); or
            (2) interferes with, hinders, or delays the Secretary 
        concerned in carrying out an inspection under section 143.
Such court shall have jurisdiction to provide such relief as may be 
appropriate. Any relief granted by the court to enforce an order under 
paragraph (1) shall continue in effect until the completion or final 
termination of all proceedings for review of such order unless the 
district court granting such relief sets it aside.
    (c) Delegation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
Secretary may utilize personnel of the Office of Surface Mining 
Reclamation and Enforcement to ensure compliance with the requirements 
of this title.
    (d) Penalties.--
            (1) Any person who fails to comply with any requirement of 
        a permit approved under this title or any regulation issued by 
        the Secretaries to implement this title shall be liable for a

        cessation order has been issued under subsection (a) within the 
        period permitted for its correction shall be assessed a civil 
        penalty of not less than $1,000 per violation for each day 
        during which such failure continues.
            (3) Whenever a corporation is in violation of a requirement 
        of a permit approved under this title or any regulation issued 
        by the Secretaries to implement this title or fails or refuses 
        to comply with an order issued under subsection (a), any 
        director, officer, or agent of such corporation who knowingly 
        authorized, ordered, or carried out such violation, failure, or 
        refusal shall be subject to the same penalties as may be 
        imposed upon the person referred to in paragraph (1).
    (e) Suspensions or Revocations.--The Secretary, or for National 
Forest System lands the Secretary of Agriculture, shall suspend or 
revoke a permit issued under subtitle C, in whole or in part, if the

        section 135(c)(2), fails to abate a violation to the 
        satisfaction of the Secretary concerned, or if the validity of 
        the violation is upheld on the appeal which formed the basis 
        for the conditional approval.
    (f) False Statements; Tampering.--Any person who knowingly--
            (1) makes any false material statement, representation, or 
        certification in, or omits or conceals material information
