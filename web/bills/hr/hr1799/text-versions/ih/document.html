                    (A) subject to any reasonable regulations, 
                policies, and practices that the Secretary determines 
                to be necessary; and
                    (B) in accordance with--
                            (i) section 4(d)(4) of the Wilderness Act 
                        (16 U.S.C. 1133(d)(4)); and
                            (ii) the guidelines set forth in Appendix A 
                        of the report of the Committee on Interior and 
                        Insular Affairs of the House of Representatives 
                        accompanying H.R. 2570 of the 101st Congress 
                        (H. Rept. 101-405).
    (d) Access to Private Lands.--The Secretary shall provide any owner 
of private property--
            (1) within the boundary of a national conservation area or 
        special management area designated by this Act adequate access 
        to the property; and
            (2) within the boundary of a wilderness area designated by 
        this Act adequate access to the property in accordance with 
        section 5(a) of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1134(a)).
    (e) Valid Existing Rights.--The designation of the National 
Conservation Areas, Wilderness Areas, and Special Management Areas is 
subject to valid rights in existence on the date of enactment of this 
Act.
    (f) Withdrawal.--Subject to valid existing rights, all public land 
within the National Conservation Areas, Wilderness Areas, and Special 
Management Areas, and all land and interests in land acquired by the 
United States within the National Conservation Areas, Wilderness Areas, 
or Special Management Areas is withdrawn from--
            (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under 
        the public land laws;
            (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and
            (3) right-of-way, leasing, or disposition under all laws 
        relating to--
                    (A) minerals; or
                    (B) solar, wind, and geothermal energy.
    (g) No Buffer Zones.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in this subtitle creates a 
        protective perimeter or buffer zone around the National 
        Conservation Areas, Wilderness Areas, or Special Management 
        Areas.
            (2) Activities outside national conservation areas, 
        wilderness areas, and special management areas.--The fact that 
        an activity or use on land outside a National Conservation 
        Area, Wilderness Area, or Special Management Area can be seen 
        or heard within the area shall not preclude the activity or use 
        outside the boundary of the areas.
    (h) Fire, Insects, and Diseases.--Subject to such terms and 
conditions as the Secretary determines to be desirable and appropriate, 
the Secretary may undertake such measures as are necessary to control 
fire, insects, and diseases--
            (1) in the Wilderness Areas, in accordance with section 
        4(d)(1) of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1133(d)(1)); and
            (2) except as provided in paragraph (1), in the National 
        Conservation Areas and Special Management Areas in accordance 
        with this Act and any other applicable laws.
    (i) Invasive Species and Noxious Weeds.--In accordance with any 
applicable laws and subject to such terms and conditions as the 
Secretary determines to be desirable and appropriate, the Secretary may 
prescribe measures to control nonnative invasive plants and noxious 
weeds within the National Conservation Areas and Special Management 
Areas.
    (j) Native American Uses and Interests.--To the extent practicable, 
the Secretary shall ensure access to the National Conservation Areas, 
Wilderness Areas, and Special Management Areas by members of an Indian 
tribe for traditional cultural purposes, including spiritual or food-
gathering activities. In implementing this paragraph, the Secretary, 
upon the request of an Indian tribe, may temporarily close to the 
general public use of one or more specific portions of a national 
conservation area, wilderness area, or special management area in order 
to protect the privacy of traditional cultural activities in such areas 
by members of the Indian tribe. Any such closure shall be made to 
affect the smallest practicable area for the minimum period necessary 
for such purposes. Such access shall be consistent with the purpose and 
intent of Public Law 95-341 (42 U.S.C. 1996), commonly referred to as 
the American Indian Religious Freedom Act.
    (k) Utility Rights-of-Way.--Nothing in this Act precludes the 
Secretary from renewing an existing utility right-of-way through a 
national conservation area or special management area in a manner that 
minimizes harm to the purposes of the national conservation area or 
special management area described in subsection (b) and section 5(a)--
            (1) in accordance with--
                    (A) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 
                (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); and
                    (B) any other applicable law; and
            (2) subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary 
        determines to be appropriate.
    (l) Maintenance of Existing Communications Facilities.--The 
provisions of this Act shall not be construed to prevent--
            (1) the maintenance of communications facilities, in 
        existence on the date of the enactment of this Act and located 
        in a national conservation area; or
            (2) limited motorized access to such facilities when non-
        motorized access means are not reasonably available or when 
        time is of the essence, subject to such conditions as the 
        Secretary considers to be desirable.
    (m) Maintenance of Agua Caliente Road.--In preparing resource 
management and travel management plans for the Lower Sonoran Field 
Office, the Secretary shall provide for protection of the existing, 
low-standard (BLM Maintenance Level 3) Agua Caliente which provides 
access to the wilderness and high conservation value lands designated 
by this Act, and shall assure that the wilderness environment and 
atmosphere enjoyed by users of this road, which Congress finds is well-
matched to the rugged and wild character of the wilderness beyond the 
roadside, is not degraded by incompatible development within the road 
corridor or by improvement of the road itself other than as he 
determines necessary for public safety.

SEC. 8. ACQUISITION OF LAND.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary may acquire non-public land within 
the boundaries of the National Conservation Areas, the Wilderness 
Areas, or the Special Management Areas established by this Act only 
through exchange, donation, or purchase from a willing seller.
    (b) Management.--Land acquired under this section shall--
            (1) become part of the National Conservation Areas, the 
        Wilderness Areas, or the Special Management Areas involved; and
            (2) be managed in accordance with this Act and any other 
        applicable laws.

SEC. 9. BORDER SECURITY.

    Nothing in this Act--
            (1) prevents the Secretary of Homeland Security from 
        undertaking law enforcement and border security activities--
                    (A) in the National Conservation Areas and Special 
                Management Areas outside the Wilderness Areas, or
                    (B) in accordance with section 4(c) of the 
                Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1133(c)), within the 
                Wilderness Areas, including the ability to use 
                motorized access within a Wilderness Area while in 
                pursuit of a suspect;
            (2) affects the 2006 Memorandum of Understanding among the 
        Department of Homeland Security, the Department of the 
        Interior, and the Department of Agriculture regarding 
        cooperative national security and counterterrorism efforts on 
        public land along the borders of the United States; or
            (3) prevents the Secretary of Homeland Security from 
        conducting any low-level overflights over the National 
        Conservation Areas and Special Management Areas or the 
        Wilderness Areas that may be necessary for law enforcement and 
        border security purposes.

SEC. 10. WATER RIGHTS.

    (a) Reservation of Rights.--With respect to each wilderness area 
designated by this Act, Congress hereby reserves a quantity of water 
sufficient to fulfill the purposes of this Act. The priority date of 
such reserved rights shall be the date of enactment of this Act.
    (b) Protection of Rights.--The Secretary and all other officers of 
the United States shall take steps necessary to protect the rights 
reserved by subsection (a), including the filing by the Secretary of a 
claim for the quantification of such rights in any present or future 
appropriate stream adjudication in the courts of the State in which the 
United States is or may be joined and which is conducted in accordance 
with the McCarran Amendment (43 U.S.C. 666).
    (c) No Relinquishment or Reduction.--Nothing in this section shall 
be construed as a relinquishment or reduction of any water rights 
reserved or appropriated by the United States in the State on or before 
the date of enactment of this Act.
    (d) Reservation for Specific Wilderness.--The Federal water rights 
reserved by this section are specific to the wilderness located in the 
State designated by this Act. Nothing in this section related to 
reserved Federal water rights shall be construed as establishing a 
precedent with regard to any future designations, nor shall it 
constitute an interpretation of any other Act or any designation made 
pursuant thereto.
