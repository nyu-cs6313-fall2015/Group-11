 To measure the progress of recovery and development efforts in Haiti 
 following the earthquake of January 12, 2010, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Assessing Progress in Haiti Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Government of Haiti, more than 316,000 
        people died as a result of the earthquake that struck 15 miles 
        southwest of Port-au-Prince on January 12, 2010, including 103 
        United States citizens and more than 100 United Nations 
        personnel.
            (2) According to the United Nations and the International 
        Organization for Migration, an estimated 3,000,000 people were 
        directly affected by the disaster, and more than 2,100,000 
        people were displaced from their homes.
            (3) The Post Disaster Needs Assessment conducted by the 
        Government of Haiti, the United Nations, the World Bank, the 
        Inter-American Development Bank, and others estimated that 
        damage and economic losses totaled $7,804,000,000, 
        approximately 120 percent of Haiti's gross domestic product in 
        2009.
            (4) The initial emergency response of the men and women of 
        the United States Government, led by the United States Agency 
        for International Development (USAID) and the United States 
        Southern Command, as well as of cities, towns, individuals, 
        businesses, and philanthropic organizations across the United 
        States, was swift and resolute.
            (5) According to the Government of Haiti, numerous 
        multilateral agencies such as the United Nations, and 
        international NGOs, Haiti faces an ongoing food crisis as a 
        result of the earthquake and subsequent damage caused by 
        tropical storms and hurricanes, as well as long term neglect of 
        the agriculture sector.
            (6) According to the International Organization for 
        Migration, approximately 350,000 people remain in spontaneous 
        and organized camps in Haiti, and reports by the General 
        Accountability Office, USAID Inspector General, and civil 
        society organizations indicate that the pace of recovery and 
        development has lagged significantly behind the emergency 
        relief phase.
            (7) Haitian civil society organizations have noted a lack 
        of systematic and widespread consultations with Haitian 
        communities for their input in the recovery and development 
        process.
            (8) On October 21, 2010, an outbreak of cholera was 
        detected and according to the Haitian Ministry of Public Health 
        and Population, as of February 17, 2013, more than 8,000 people 
        had died from cholera and more than 647,500 had been infected 
        with the disease.
            (9) The United States has provided more than $95,000,000 in 
        aid to combat the cholera epidemic and care for the victims.
            (10) The United Nations Office of the Special Envoy for 
        Haiti estimates that, including donor pledges and other 
        support, approximately $6,400,000,000 has been disbursed, with 
        an additional amount of $3,800,000,000 committed, to assist in 
        Haiti's recovery and development.
            (11) The United States Government has obligated 
        approximately $3,600,000,000 for relief, recovery and 
        development in Haiti since the earthquake, of which 
        $1,300,000,000 had been disbursed as of April 2013.
            (12) Significant challenges remain in Haiti which will 
        require continued recovery and development aid from the 
        international community for the foreseeable future.
            (13) The Haitian Diaspora has also played an essential role 
        in Haiti's reconstruction and the United States Government 
        should take steps to increase outreach and encourage 
        participation by Haitian Americans in recovery and development 
        activities in Haiti.
