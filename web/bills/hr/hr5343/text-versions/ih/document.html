   To amend section 1111(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965 to require that annual State report cards reflect 
      the same race groups as the decennial census of population.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``All Students Count Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. DISAGGREGATION OF INFORMATION ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN ANNUAL 
              STATE REPORT CARDS.

    Section 1111(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(h)(1)(C)(i)) is amended to read as follows:
                            ``(i) information, in the aggregate and 
                        disaggregated by the same major race groups as 
                        the decennial census of the population, 
                        ethnicity, gender, disability status, migrant 
                        status, English proficiency, and status as 
                        economically disadvantaged, and cross-tabulated 
                        across all of such subgroups by gender and by 
                        disability, on student achievement at each 
                        proficiency level on the State academic 
                        assessments described in subsection (b)(3), 
                        except that such disaggregation and cross-
                        tabulation shall not be required in a case in 
                        which the number of students in a subgroup is 
                        insufficient to yield statistically reliable 
                        information or the results would reveal 
                        personally identifiable information about an 
                        individual student;''.
