              REFUGE.

    (a) Authority To Establish.--The Secretary of the Navy may 
establish a surface danger zone over the Guam National Wildlife Refuge 
or any portion thereof if the Secretary determines that establishment 
of a surface danger zone will support the operation by the Department 
of the Navy of a live-fire training range complex on Andersen Air Force 
Base, Northwest Field, to support training and operations.
    (b) Treatment of Operations.--The operation of a live-fire training 
range complex on Andersen Air Force Base, Northwest Field, and 
associated surface danger zone, if established under subsection (a), 
are deemed to be authorized uses of the Guam National Wildlife Refuge.
    (c) Closure to Public.--
            (1) Authority to close.--The Secretary of the Navy may 
        close to public use any road or trail within, or any portion 
        of, the Guam National Wildlife Refuge if the Secretary 
        determines that military operations, public safety, or national 
        security require the closure.
            (2) Limited area and duration.--The Secretary shall limit a 
        closure under paragraph (1) to the minimum area and period that 
        the Secretary determines to be appropriate for the purpose for 
        which the closure is imposed.
            (3) Notification requirements.--Before imposing a closure 
        under paragraph (1), and for the duration of the closure, the 
        Secretary shall--
                    (A) post and maintain appropriate warning notices 
                regarding the closure; and
                    (B) take appropriate steps to notify the public 
                concerning of the closure.
    (d) Relation to Refuge Management and Uses.--Nothing in this 
section limits the management authority of the Secretary of the 
Interior over the Guam National Wildlife Refuge and other uses of the 
Guam National Wildlife Refuge established pursuant to section 4 of the 
National Wildlife Refuge System Administration Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 
668dd) to the extent such management authority and refuge uses are 
compatible with the authorities provided to the Secretary of the Navy 
under subsections (a) and (c).
