  <summary>4/4/2014--Introduced.
Guam Military Training and Readiness Act of 2014 - Authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to establish a surface danger zone over the Guam National Wildlife Refuge if its establishment will support the operation by the Department of the Navy of a live-fire training range complex on Andersen Air Force Base, Northwest Field, to support training and operations. Deems the operation of such complex and the associated surface danger zone to be authorized uses of the Refuge.

Authorizes the Secretary to close to public use any road or trail within, or any portion of, such Refuge if military operations, public safety, or national security require such closure. Directs the Secretary to: (1) limit such a closure to the minimum appropriate area and period, and (2) post and maintain appropriate warning notices and notify the public before and for the duration of such a closure.</summary>
