To amend the National Labor Relations Act with respect to the criteria 
    for determining employee units appropriate for the purposes of 
                         collective bargaining.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Representation Fairness Restoration 
Act''.

SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE UNITS FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

    Section 9(b) of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 159(b)) 
is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (3) as 
        subparagraphs (A) through (C);
            (2) by striking ``The Board shall decide'' and all that 
        follows through ``or subdivision thereof:'' and inserting the 
        following: ``(1) In each case, prior to an election, the Board 
        shall determine, in order to assure to employees the fullest 
        freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this Act, the 
        unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining. 
        Unless otherwise stated in this Act, and excluding any 
        bargaining unit determination promulgated through rulemaking 
        before August 26, 2011, the unit appropriate for purposes of 
        collective bargaining shall consist of employees that share a 
        sufficient community of interest. In determining whether 
        employees share a sufficient community of interest, the Board 
        shall consider--
                    ``(A) similarity of wages, benefits, and working 
                conditions;
                    ``(B) similarity of skills and training;
                    ``(C) centrality of management and common 
                supervision;
                    ``(D) extent of interchange and frequency of 
                contact between employees;
                    ``(E) integration of the work flow and 
                interrelationship of the production process;
                    ``(F) the consistency of the unit with the 
                employer's organizational structure;
                    ``(G) similarity of job functions and work; and
                    ``(H) the bargaining history in the particular unit 
                and the industry.
        To avoid the proliferation or fragmentation of bargaining 
        units, employees shall not be excluded from the unit unless the 
        interests of the group seeking a separate unit are sufficiently 
        distinct from those of other employees to warrant the 
        establishment of a separate unit. Whether additional employees 
        should be included in a proposed unit shall be determined based 
        on whether such additional employees and proposed unit members 
        share a sufficient community of interest, with the sole 
        exception of proposed accretions to an existing unit, in which 
        the inclusion of additional employees shall be based on whether 
        such additional employees and existing unit members share an 
        overwhelming community of interest and the additional employees 
        have little or no separate identity.''; and
            (3) by striking ``Provided, That the Board'' and inserting 
        the following:
    ``(2) The Board''.
                                 <all>
