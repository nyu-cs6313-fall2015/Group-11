                                 A BILL


 
   To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to include 
 certain areas within the frontier and remote area levels designations.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. MODIFYING HRSA METHODOLOGY FOR DESIGNATION OF FRONTIER AND 
              REMOTE AREAS.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in developing the 
methodology for the designation of frontier and remote areas published 
in the Federal Register on May 5, 2014 (79 Fed. Reg. 25599), the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--
            (1) designate as a frontier area any area in Hawaii or 
        Alaska that is defined or designated as rural under the law of 
        the respective State for purposes of determining whether the 
        area qualifies as rural for a Federal program; and
            (2) include, in addition to the frontier and remote area 
        levels otherwise defined pursuant to such methodology, a level 
        (developed in accordance with a process established by the 
        Secretary) for areas that have unique characteristics (such as 
        being geographically isolated) that should qualify such areas 
        for such designation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
