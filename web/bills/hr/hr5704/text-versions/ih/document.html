                                 A BILL


 
To amend title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 
              to establish a Master Teacher Corp program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Master Teacher Corps Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) As stated in The Heart of the Matter, a report 
        published by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, our 
        need for a broadly literate population is more urgent than 
        ever.
            (2) As citizens, we need to absorb an ever-growing body of 
        information and to assess the sources of that information.
            (3) As workers, we need to adapt to an ever-accelerating 
        rate of technological change and to reflect on the implications 
        of these changes.
            (4) As members of a global community, we need to look 
        beyond our borders to communicate and interact with individuals 
        from societies and cultures different from our own.
            (5) As a Nation, we need to provide an educational 
        foundation for our future stability and prosperity--drawing on 
        all areas of knowledge.
            (6) Good teachers matter. Students with highly skilled 
        teachers can gain an additional year's worth of learning 
        compared to their peers in other classrooms. Moreover, having 
        an effective teacher for three to four years in a row can erase 
        the income-based achievement gap.
            (7) Attrition among new teachers is exceptionally high. As 
        many as 50 percent of new teachers leave within their first 
        five years teaching. Moreover, many of those leaving are the 
        highly performing new teachers.
            (8) Short-term, in-service professional development has not 
        been found to be effective. Rather, successful professional 
        development is extensive, sustained, focused on content, and 
        embedded in the day-to-day work of teachers.
            (9) Teacher induction and mentoring programs increase job 
        satisfaction and retention among new teachers. Furthermore, 
        research shows that additional young people would consider 
        teaching if the profession offered more opportunities for 
        advancement and collaboration.
            (10) Programs that provide teachers with opportunities to 
        lead and grow, and to be recognized and compensated for their 
        leadership, are key to keeping talented teachers in the 
        classroom.
            (11) A Master Teacher Corps will provide schools a way to 
        use their human capital to improve student achievement by 
        providing their best teachers with an opportunity to share best 
        practices and support other teachers.

    (a) In General.--Part A of title II of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended by adding at
