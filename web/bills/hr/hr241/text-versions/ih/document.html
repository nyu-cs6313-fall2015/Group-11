    ``(d)(1) In managing the provision of hospital care and medical 
services under section 1710(a) of this title, the Secretary shall 
ensure that for each veteran seeking such care or services from a 
Department medical facility, the standard for access to care, 
determined from the date on which the veteran contacts the Department 
seeking an appointment until the date on which a visit with an 
appropriate health care provider is completed, is 30 days.
    ``(2) The Secretary shall periodically review the performance of 
Department medical facilities compared to the standard established 
under paragraph (1). The Secretary shall submit to the Committees on 
Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a semi-
annual report providing an assessment of the Department's performance 
in meeting that standard.
    ``(3)(A) Not later than 60 days after the end of a calendar-year 
quarter, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' 
Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report for that 
calendar-year quarter on the experience of the Department during the 
quarter covered by the report with respect to waiting times for 
veterans seeking appointments at Department medical facilities.
    ``(B) Each report under subparagraph (A) shall include each of the 
following:
            ``(i) The total number of veterans waiting by the following 
        categories:
                    ``(I) Those waiting under 30 days for scheduled 
                appointments.
                    ``(II) Those waiting over 30 days but less than 60 
                days.
                    ``(III) Those waiting over 60 days but less than 4 
                months.
                    ``(IV) Those waiting over 4 months but who cannot 
                be scheduled within 6 months.
                    ``(V) Any remaining veterans who cannot be 
                scheduled, with the reasons therefor.
            ``(ii) For each category set forth in subparagraph (A), 
        distinctions between--
                    ``(I) waiting times for primary care and specialty 
                care; and
                    ``(II) waiting times for veterans who are newly 
                enrolled versus those who were enrolled before October 
                1, 2001.
            ``(iii) The number of veterans who have enrolled in the 
        patient enrollment system under section 1705 of this title but 
        have not since such enrollment sought care at a Department 
        medical facility.''.

medical services provided on or after the date of the enactment of this 
Act.
