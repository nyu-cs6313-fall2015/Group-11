Park, to conduct a study of potential land acquisitions, and for other 
                               purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``San Antonio Missions National 
Historical Park Boundary Expansion Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. BOUNDARY EXPANSION.

     Section 201(a) of Public Law 95-629 (16 U.S.C. 410ee(a)) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``In order'' and inserting ``(1) In 
        order'';
            (2) by striking ``The park shall also'' and inserting the 
        following:
    ``(2) The park shall also'';
            (3) by striking ``After advising the'' and inserting the 
        following:
    ``(5) After advising the''.
            (4) by inserting after paragraph (2) (as so designated by 
        paragraph (2)) the following:
    ``(3) The boundary of the park is further modified to include 
approximately 137 acres, as depicted on the map titled `San Antonio 
Missions National Historical Park Proposed Boundary Addition', numbered 
472/113,006A, and dated June 2012. The map shall be on file and 
available for inspection in the appropriate offices of the National 
Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior.
    ``(4) The Secretary may not acquire by condemnation any land or 
interest in land within the boundaries of the park. The Secretary is 
authorized to acquire land and interests in land that are within the 
boundaries of the park pursuant to paragraph (3) by donation or 
exchange only (and in the case of an exchange, no payment may be made 
by the Secretary to any landowner). No private property or non-Federal 
public property shall be included within the boundaries of the park 
without the written consent of the owner of such property. Nothing in 
this Act, the establishment of the park, or the management plan of the 
park shall be construed to create buffer zones outside of the park. 
That an activity or use can be seen or heard from within the park shall 
not preclude the conduct of that activity or use outside the park.''.
            Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to expand the 
        boundary of the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, 
        and for other purposes.''.
