                                 A BILL


 
To establish a Road Usage Fee Pilot Program to study mileage-based fee 
                    systems, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Road Usage Fee Pilot Program Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The 2009 report of the National Surface Transportation 
        Infrastructure Financing Commission recommends a transition 
        away from the fuel tax to a more stable funding source, noting 
        that a mileage-based fee system is the consensus choice for 
        policy leaders.
            (2) The 2008 report of the National Surface Transportation 
        and Revenue Study Commission recommends further study of the 
        implementation of mileage-based fee systems at the State level 
        and of their compatibility with a national revenue system, 
        noting that in the long run, a mileage-based fee system seems 
        the most likely and appropriate method to be implemented.
            (3) According to the Congressional Budget Office, the 
        revenue raised from the gas tax since its last increase in 1992 
        has lost over one-third of its purchasing power due to 
        increasing fuel efficiency, changing transportation patterns, 
        and inflation.
            (4) By 2030, the corporate average fuel economy standards 
        will have reduced Highway Trust Fund receipts by more than 20 
        percent.
            (5) The fuel tax revenue mechanism results in some 
        industries paying more than their commensurate road use.
            (6) Since 1990, while gas tax revenues have consistently 
        decreased, the number of vehicle miles traveled nationally has 
        consistently increased.

SEC. 3. ROAD USAGE FEE PILOT PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of the Treasury (in this Act 
referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a competitive grant 
program to be known as the Road Usage Fee Pilot Program (in this Act 
referred to as the ``Program'') to make grants to eligible entities 
to--
            (1) conduct pilot studies of methods for recording and 
        reporting the number of miles traveled by particular vehicles;
            (2) conduct pilot studies of payment, enforcement, and 
        privacy protection methods for mileage-based fee systems; and
            (3) implement mileage-based fee systems in jurisdictions 
        that have adopted a plan for such systems.
    (b) Application Required.--To be eligible for a grant under the 
Program, an eligible entity shall submit to the Secretary an 
application at such time, in such form, and containing such information 
and assurances as the Secretary may require.
    (c) Selection of Pilot Studies.--In awarding grants under the 
Program, the Secretary shall select pilot studies that, in combination, 
explore means to address the following concerns:
            (1) Protection of personal privacy.
            (2) Ease of public compliance.
            (3) Level of public acceptance.
            (4) Geographic and income equity.
            (5) Integration with State and local transportation revenue 
        mechanisms.
            (6) Administrative issues.
            (7) Cost.
            (8) Enforcement issues.
            (9) Potential for fraud or evasion.
            (10) Feasibility of implementation.
    (d) Priority.--In awarding grants under the Program, the Secretary 
shall give priority to pilot studies that--
            (1) serve as a model for broad implementation of a mileage-
        based fee system;
            (2) address concerns of rural and urban user equity;
            (3) involve multistate projects;
            (4) have a high volume of enrolled vehicles;
            (5) integrate with State and local revenue systems;
            (6) integrate with local demand management plans;
            (7) are likely to lead to implementation of mileage-based 
        fee systems, dependent on the results of the program;
            (8) integrate with other intelligent transportation system 
        technologies; and
            (9) test the proposed revenue collection system by 
        collecting and distributing revenue.
    (e) Required Minimum Funds for Planning Organizations.--In awarding 
grants under the Program, the Secretary shall ensure that not less than 
10 percent of funds available under the Program in a fiscal year are 
reserved for pilot studies carried out in conjunction with metropolitan 
planning organizations or regional transportation planning 
organizations.
    (f) Cost Sharing.--An eligible entity that receives a grant under 
this Act shall provide funds, from non-Federal sources, in an amount 
equal to 20 percent of the amount of grant funds provided to the entity 
to carry out the activities supported by the grant.

SEC. 4. WORKING GROUPS.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Transportation, shall establish the following working 
groups:

                    (B) develop national technology standards and make

                transportation data laws; and
                    (C) balance the effectiveness of revenue systems 
                with user privacy.
            (2) A transportation system and equity working group that 
        shall evaluate the costs of collection and administration of

        in achieving rural and urban user equity.
            (3) An environmental working group that shall evaluate the 
        potential of the methods studied in the Program to manage
