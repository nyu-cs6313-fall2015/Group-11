  <summary>1/27/2014--Introduced.
Dairy COOL Act of 2014 - Amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to define dairy product for country of origin purposes.

Requires a retailer of a covered commodity that is a dairy product to designate the origin of the covered commodity as: (1) each country in which or from which the one or more dairy ingredients or dairy components of the covered commodity were produced, originated, or sourced; and (2) each country in which the covered commodity was processed.

Declares that, with respect to a dairy product produced exclusively in the United States, designation by a retailer of the state, region, or locality of production shall be sufficient to identify the United States as the country of origin.</summary>
