    decisions that maintain the health, safety, and best interests of a 
    child while at the same time encouraging the emotional and 
    developmental growth of the child, that a caregiver shall use when 
    determining whether to allow a child in foster care under the 
    responsibility of the State to participate in extracurricular, 
    enrichment, cultural, and social activities.
        ``(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term `caregiver' 
    means a foster parent with whom a child in foster care has been 
    placed or a designated official for a child care institution in 
    which a child in foster care has been placed.

        suitable for children of the same chronological age or level of 
        maturity or that are determined to be developmentally-
        appropriate for a child, based on the development of cognitive, 
        emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities that are typical 
        for an age or age group; and
            ``(ii) in the case of a specific child, activities or items 
        that are suitable for the child based on the developmental 
        stages attained by the child with respect to the cognitive, 
        emotional, physical, and behavioral capacities of the child.
        ``(B) In the event that any age-related activities have 
    implications relative to the academic curriculum of a child, 
    nothing in this part or part B shall be construed to authorize an 
    officer or employee of the Federal Government to mandate, direct, 
    or control a State or local educational agency, or the specific 
    instructional content, academic achievement standards and 
    assessments, curriculum, or program of instruction of a school.''.

        social, extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social 
        activities, including sports, field trips, and overnight 
        activities lasting 1 or more days, and to decisions involving 
        the signing of permission slips and arranging of transportation 
        for the child to and from extracurricular, enrichment, and 
        social activities'' before the semicolon.
        (3) Technical assistance.--The Secretary of Health and Human 
    Services shall provide assistance to the States on best practices 
    for devising strategies to assist foster parents in applying a 
    reasonable and prudent parent standard in a manner that protects 
    child safety, while also allowing children to experience normal and 
    beneficial activities, including methods for appropriately 
    considering the concerns of the biological parents of a child in 
    decisions related to participation of the child in activities (with 
    the understanding that those concerns should not necessarily 
    determine the participation of the child in any activity).

471(a)(10) (42 U.S.C. 671(a)(10)) is amended to read as follows:

        standards for the institutions or homes, including standards 
        related to admission policies, safety, sanitation, and 
        protection of civil rights, and which shall permit use of the 
        reasonable and prudent parenting standard;
            ``(B) that the standards established pursuant to 
        subparagraph (A) shall be applied by the State to any foster 
        family home or child care institution receiving funds under 
        this part or part B and shall require, as a condition of each 
        contract entered into by a child care institution to provide 
        foster care, the presence on-site of at least 1 official who, 
        with respect to any child placed at the child care institution, 
        is designated to be the caregiver who is authorized to apply 
        the reasonable and prudent parent standard to decisions 
        involving the participation of the child in age or 
        developmentally-appropriate activities, and who is provided 
        with training in how to use and apply the reasonable and 
        prudent parent standard in the same manner as prospective 
        foster parents are provided the training pursuant to paragraph 
        (24);
            ``(C) that the standards established pursuant to 
        subparagraph (A) shall include policies related to the 
        liability of foster parents and private entities under contract 
        by the State involving the application of the reasonable and 
        prudent parent standard, to ensure appropriate liability for 
        caregivers when a child participates in an approved activity 
        and the caregiver approving the activity acts in accordance 
        with the reasonable and prudent parent standard; and
            ``(D) that a waiver of any standards established pursuant 
        to subparagraph (A) may be made only on a case-by-case basis 
        for nonsafety standards (as determined by the State) in 
        relative foster family homes for specific children in care;''.

    care until 18 years of age have regular, ongoing opportunities to 
    engage in age or developmentally-appropriate activities as defined 
    in section 475(11).''.

    requirements imposed by the amendments made by this section, the 
    plan shall not be regarded as failing to meet any of the additional

        are already working to address the sex trafficking of children

    SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING OFFERING OF VOLUNTARY 
      PARENTING TIME ARRANGEMENTS.
    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
        (1) The separation of a child from a parent does not end the 
    financial or other responsibilities of the parent toward the child.
        (2) Increased parental access and visitation not only improve 
    parent-child relationships and outcomes for children, but also have 
    been demonstrated to result in improved child support collections, 
    which creates a double win for children--a more engaged parent and 
    improved financial security.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
        (1) establishing parenting time arrangements when obtaining 
    child support orders is an important goal which should be 
    accompanied by strong family violence safeguards; and
        (2) States should use existing funding sources to support the 
    establishment of parenting time arrangements, including child 
    support incentives, Access and Visitation Grants, and Healthy 
    Marriage Promotion and Responsible Fatherhood Grants.

        agencies operating programs under State plans approved under 
        this part are required under applicable Federal law to 
        electronically exchange with another State agency; and

        applicable Federal law.
        ``(2) Requirements.--The data exchange standards required by 
    paragraph (1) shall, to the extent practicable--

        searchable, computer-readable format, such as the eXtensible 
        Markup Language;
            ``(B) contain interoperable standards developed and 
        maintained by intergovernmental partnerships, such as the 
        National Information Exchange Model;
            ``(C) incorporate interoperable standards developed and

        improves program efficiency and effectiveness; and
            ``(F) be capable of being continually upgraded as 
        necessary.
        ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
    be construed to require a change to existing data exchange 
    standards found to be effective and efficient.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
shall issue a proposed rule within 24 months after the date of the 
enactment of this section. The rule shall identify federally required 
data exchanges, include specification and timing of exchanges to be 
standardized, and address the factors used in determining whether and 
when to standardize data exchanges. It should also specify State 
implementation options and describe future milestones.
    SEC. 305. REPORT TO CONGRESS.

            available to custodial and noncustodial parents are non-
            duplicative, evidence-based, and produce quality outcomes, 
            and connecting custodial and noncustodial parents to those 
            services and support programs;
