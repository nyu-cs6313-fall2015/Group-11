    (a) Competitive Grants Authorized.--
            (1) Authorization and primary purpose.--The Secretary of 
        the Air Force may make a grant, on a competitive basis, to an 
        existing biofuels research center in the United States to 
        conduct pilot-scale research, development, and testing of bio-
        based fuels that are suitable for use by the Air Force as an 
        aviation fuel for jet aircraft.
            (2) Additional purposes.--Grant funds provided under 
        paragraph (1) may also be used by the grant recipient to train 
        military and civilian personnel in the new technologies and to 
        conduct a study regarding the economic feasibility of a full-
        scale bio-based aviation fuel production facility.
    (b) Grant Applications and Selection.--
            (1) In general.--Grant applicants shall submit an 
        application to the Secretary of the Air Force at such time, in 
        such manner, and accompanied by such information as the 
        Secretary may reasonably require.
            (2) Selection preference.--In conducting the competition 
        for selection of the grant recipient, the Secretary shall give 
        a preference to an existing biofuels research center in the 
        United States that--
                    (A) has the capacity and expertise necessary to 
                quickly and efficiently conduct the pilot-scale 
                research, development, and testing described in 
                subsection (a)(1); and

                            (ii) a military installation with 
                        responsibility for military air transportation; 
                        and
                            (iii) a private or commercial airport with 
                        capacity to host a research and pilot 
                        production facility.
    (c) Grant Amounts.--Grants under subsection (a) may not exceed a 
total $25,000,000. With the approval of the Secretary of the Air Force, 
grant funds may be used for infrastructure to facilitate the pilot-
scale research, development, and testing described in subsection 
(a)(1).
    (d) Source of Funds.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
the Secretary of Defense shall transfer to the Secretary of the Air 
Force $25,000,000 from unobligated amounts in the Afghanistan 
Infrastructure Fund to provide funds for grants under subsection (a). 
The transferred funds shall be available to the Secretary of the Air 
Force, until expended, only for the purpose of making grants under 
subsection (a). The Secretary of the Air Force shall obligate such 
funds as soon as practicable after the establishment of the grant 
program.
