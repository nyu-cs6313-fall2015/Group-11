        Code is amended by adding at the end the following new 
        paragraph:
            ``(10) Required minimum distribution transferred to health

                has attained the age of 70\1/2\ and who elects the 
                application of this paragraph for a taxable year, gross 
                income of the individual for the taxable year does not 
                include a qualified HSA transfer to the extent such 
                transfer is otherwise includible in gross income.
                    ``(B) Qualified hsa transfer.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, the term `qualified HSA transfer' means any 
                distribution from an individual retirement plan--
                            ``(i) to a health savings account of the 
                        individual in a direct trustee-to-trustee 
                        transfer,

                        distribution calendar year ending during the 
                        taxable year.
                    ``(C) Application of section 72.--Notwithstanding 
                section 72, in determining the extent to which an 
                amount is treated as a distribution for purposes of 
                paragraph (1), the entire amount of the distribution 
                shall be treated as includible in gross income without 
                regard to paragraph (1) to the extent that such amount 
                does not exceed the aggregate amount which would have 
                been so includible if all amounts in all individual 
                retirement plans of the individual were distributed 
                during such taxable year and all such plans were 
                treated as 1 contract for purposes of determining under 
                section 72 the aggregate amount which would have been 
                so includible. Proper adjustments shall be made in 
                applying section 72 to other distributions in such 
                taxable year and subsequent taxable years.

        attained the age of 70\1/2\ and who elects the application of 
        this subsection for a taxable year, gross income of the 
        individual for the taxable year does not include a qualified 
        HSA transfer to the extent such transfer is otherwise 
        includible in gross income.
            ``(2) Qualified hsa transfer.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `qualified HSA transfer' means any

        income without regard to paragraph (1) to the extent that such 
        amount does not exceed the aggregate amount which would have 
        been so includible if all amounts in all eligible retirement 
        plans of the individual were distributed during such taxable 
        year and all such plans were treated as 1 contract for purposes 
        of determining under section 72 the aggregate amount which 
        would have been so includible. Proper adjustments shall be made 
        in applying section 72 to other distributions in such taxable 
        year and subsequent taxable years.
            ``(4) Eligible retirement plan.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `eligible retirement plan' has the meaning 
        given such term by subsection (c)(8)(B) (determined without 
        regard to clauses (i) and (ii) thereof).''.
