SEC. 3. ASSESSMENT OF SMART GRID COST EFFECTIVENESS IN PRODUCTS.

    (a) Assessment.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary and the Administrator shall each assess the 
potential for cost-effective integration of Smart Grid technologies and 
capabilities in all products that are reviewed by the Department of 
Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, respectively, for 
potential designation as Energy Star products.
    (b) Analysis.--(1) Not later than 2 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the Administrator shall each 
prepare an analysis of the potential energy savings, greenhouse gas 
emission reductions, and electricity cost savings that could accrue for 
each of the products identified by the assessment in subsection (a) in 
the following optimal circumstances:
            (A) The products possessed Smart Grid capability and 
        interoperability that is tested and proven reliable.
            (B) The products were utilized in an electricity utility 
        service area which had Smart Grid capability and offered 
        customers rate or program incentives to use the products.
            (C) The utility's rates reflected national average costs, 
        including average peak and valley seasonal and daily 
        electricity costs.
            (D) Consumers using such products took full advantage of 
        such capability.
            (E) The utility avoided incremental investments and rate 
        increases related to such savings.
    (2) The analysis under paragraph (1) shall be considered the ``best 
case'' Smart Grid analysis. On the basis of such an analysis for each 
product, the Secretary and the Administrator shall determine whether 
the installation of Smart Grid capability for such a product would be 
cost effective. For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``cost 
effective'' means that the cumulative savings from using the product 
under the best case Smart Grid circumstances for a period of one-half 
of the product's expected useful life will be greater than the 
incremental cost of the Smart Grid features included in the product.
    (3) To the extent that including Smart Grid capability in any 
products analyzed under paragraph (2) is found to be cost effective in 
the best case, the Secretary and the Administrator shall, not later 
than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act take each of the 
following actions:
            (A) Inform the manufacturer of such product of such finding 
        of cost effectiveness.
            (B) Assess the potential contributions the development and 
        use of products with Smart Grid technologies bring to reducing 
        peak demand and promoting grid stability.
            (C) Assess the potential national energy savings and 
        electricity cost savings that could be realized if Smart Grid 
        potential were installed in the relevant products reviewed by 
        the Energy Star program.
            (D) Assess and identify options for providing consumers 
        information on products with Smart Grid capabilities, including 
        the necessary conditions for cost-effective savings.
            (E) Submit a report to Congress summarizing the results of 
        the assessment for each class of products, and presenting the 
        potential energy and greenhouse gas savings that could result 
        if Smart Grid capability were installed and utilized on such 
        products.

SEC. 4. INCLUSIONS OF SMART GRID CAPABILITY ON APPLIANCE ENERGY GUIDE 
              LABELS.

    Section 324(a)(2) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42

                        depended on the Smart Grid capability of the 
                        utility system in which the product was 
                        installed and the active utilization of that 
                        feature by the customer; and
                            ``(III) on a utility system with Smart Grid 
                        capability, the use of the product's Smart Grid

        neutral and objective manner.
    (4) The applicable peak demand reduction goals shall provide that--
            (A) load-serving entities will reduce or mitigate peak 
        demand by a minimum percentage amount from the applicable 
        baseline to a lower peak demand during calendar year 2015;
            (B) load-serving entities will reduce or mitigate peak 
        demand by a minimum percentage greater amount from the 
        applicable baseline to a lower peak demand during calendar year 
        2018; and
            (C) the minimum percentage reductions established as peak 
        demand reduction goals shall be the maximum reductions that are 
        realistically achievable with an aggressive effort to deploy 
        Smart Grid and peak demand reduction technologies and methods, 
        including those listed in subsection (d).
    (d) Plan.--Each load-serving entity shall prepare a peak demand 
reduction plan that demonstrates its ability to meet each applicable
