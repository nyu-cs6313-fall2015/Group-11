                    (B) Regulations.--The Board, through regulations,

                calculate the average daily closing price accordingly.
            (2) Bank holding company.--The term ``bank holding 
        company'' has the same meaning given such term in section 2 of 
        the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1841), but

                bank holding company--
                            (i) has the capital, on a total 
                        consolidated basis, necessary to absorb losses 
                        as a result of adverse economic conditions; and
                            (ii) is sufficiently capitalized to meet

                        determines, after conducting a stress test 
                        pursuant to clause (i), that the bank holding

                basis points;
                    (D) the Board shall notify the company that it will 
                be placed into receivership in accordance with
