Directs federal agency heads to use the expedited procedures of this Act to make final decisions relating to a federal project or operation to provide additional water supplies or to address emergency drought conditions.\n\nDirects the Secretaries to authorize the CVP and the SWP, combined, to operate at levels that result in negative Old and Middle River flows for a cumulative period of 28 days during certain high-flow conditions on the Sacramento River.\n\nTitle II: Protection Of Third-Party Water Rights - Directs the Secretary of the Interior to confer with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife on potential impacts to any consistency determination for operations of the SWP resulting from the implementation of this Act.\n\nRequires the Secretary, in the operation of the CVP, to: (1) adhere to California laws governing water rights priorities and honor water rights senior to those held by the United States for operation of the CVP, regardless of the source of priority; and (2) allocate water provided for irrigation purposes to existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed (i.e., water service contractors within the Shasta, Trinity, and Sacramento River Diversions of the CVP) in compliance with specified requirements.\n\nRequires the Secretary to ensure that actions taken to comply with environmental laws do not: (1) result in the involuntary reduction of water supply or fiscal impacts to recipients of water from either the SWP or the United States, or (2) cause redirected adverse water supply or fiscal impacts to those within the Sacramento River or San Joaquin River watersheds or the SWP service area.\n\nRequires the Secretary to direct the Bureau of Reclamation to develop and implement a program to enable existing CVP agricultural water service contractors within the Sacramento River Watershed to reschedule water from one year to the next.\n\nTitle III: Miscellaneous Provisions - Declares that nothing in this Act preempts or modifies any existing obligation of the United States under federal reclamation law to operate the CVP in conformity with state law, including established water rights priorities. Terminates this Act on the later of September 30, 2016, or the date on which the governor of California suspends the state of drought emergency declaration."
