            ``(1) ensure that the Department of Transportation and 
        agencies of jurisdiction possess sufficient information early 
        in the review process to determine a statement of a

of jurisdiction likely to have substantive review or approval 
responsibilities on transportation projects shall, within 90 days of 
the date of enactment of GROW AMERICA Act, jointly develop a checklist 
to help project sponsors identify potential natural, cultural, and 
historic resources in the area of a proposed project. The purpose of

                            (i) In general.--The term ``small business 
                        concern'' means a small business concern as the 
                        term is used in section 3 of the Small Business 
                        Act (15 U.S.C. 632).

                        concern'' does not include any concern or group

                        economically disadvantaged individual or 
                        individuals that have average annual gross

                individuals.--The term ``socially and economically 
                disadvantaged individuals'' has the meaning given the 
                term in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 
                U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting regulations 
                issued pursuant to that Act, except that women shall be

                    (A) survey and compile a list of the small business 
                concerns referred to in paragraph (2) in the State, 
                including the location of the small business concerns

            (4) Uniform certification.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish

                business concern for the purpose of this subsection.
                    (B) Inclusions.--The minimum uniform criteria

                enterprise awards, commitments, and achievements; and

                determines to be appropriate for the proper monitoring 
                of the disadvantaged business enterprise program.
            (6) Compliance with court orders.--Nothing in this 
        subsection limits the eligibility of an individual or entity to 
        receive funds made available under titles II and III of this 
        Act and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, if the 
        entity or person is prevented, in whole or in part, from 
        complying with paragraph (2) because a Federal court issues a 
        final order in which the court finds that a requirement or the

                of unsafe conditions and practices, causes an emergency 
                situation involving a hazard of death, personal injury, 
                or significant harm to the environment, the Secretary 
                immediately may order restrictions and prohibitions, 
                without regard to section 553 and section 554 of title 
                5, United States Code, that may be necessary to abate 
                the emergency situation.
                    ``(B) Emergency condition or practice.--The order 
                shall describe the condition or practice, or a 
                combination of conditions and practices, that causes 
                the emergency situation and promulgate standards and 
                procedures for obtaining relief from the order. This 
                paragraph does not affect the Secretary's discretion 
                under this subsection to maintain the order in effect 
                for as long as the emergency situation exists.
                    ``(C) Review of orders.--After issuing an order 
                under this subsection, the Secretary shall provide an 
                opportunity for review of the order under section 554 
                of title 5, United States Code. If a petition for 
                review is filed and the review is not completed by the 
                end of the 30-day period beginning on the date the 
                order was issued, the order stops being effective at 
                the end of that period unless the Secretary decides in 
                writing that the emergency situation still exists.
                    ``(D) Civil actions to compel issuance of orders.--
                An employee of a rail fixed guideway public 
                transportation system provider who may be exposed to 
                imminent physical injury during that employment because 
                of the Secretary's failure, without any reasonable 
                basis, to issue an order under paragraph (1) of this 
                subsection, or the employee's authorized 
                representative, may bring a civil action against the 
                Secretary in a district court of the United States to 
                compel the Secretary to issue an order. The action 
                shall be brought in the judicial district in which the 
                emergency situation is alleged to exist, in which the 
                employing provider has its principal executive office, 
                or in the District of Columbia. The Secretary's failure 
                to issue an order under paragraph (1) of this 
                subsection may be reviewed only under section 706 of 
                title 5, United States Code.''.

inserting the following at the end:

            ``(1) In general.--A report, data, investigation, or other

        be disclosed to the public pursuant to section 522(b)(3)(B) of

                investigation or other information collected or 
                obtained by the Secretary or his representative has 
                been de-identified.
                    ``(B) De-identified defined.--In this subsection, 
                the term `de-identified' means the process by which all 
                information that is likely to establish the identity of 
                specific persons or entities submitting reports, data, 
                investigation or other information is removed from the

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct a study, in 
consultation with, as appropriate, Amtrak, commuter, and other 
passenger rail operators, rail carriers that own rail infrastructure 
over which both passenger and freight trains operate, States, the 
Surface Transportation Board, and groups representing rail passengers 
and customers, in order to evaluate the shared-use of right-of-way by 
passenger and freight rail systems and the operational, institutional, 
and legal structures that would best support improvements to both of 
these systems.
    (b) Areas of Study.--In conducting the study, the Secretary shall 
evaluate--
            (1) the access and use of railroad right-of-way by a 
        railroad that does not own the right-of-way. This evaluation 
        shall include an analysis of passenger rail services that 
        operate over privately owned right-of-way, including access 
        agreements, costs of access, and the resolution of disputes 
        relating to such access or costs;
            (2) the effectiveness of existing contractual and 
        regulatory mechanisms for establishing, measuring, and 
        enforcing train performance standards, including identification 
        of gaps in those existing mechanisms and designation of 
        possible new approaches;
            (3) mechanisms for measuring and maintaining benefits 
        resulting from publically funded freight and/or intercity 
        passenger rail improvements, including those improvements 
        directed towards shared-use right-of-way;
            (4) standard approaches to operations, capacity, and cost 
        estimation modeling that allows for transparent decision-making 
        while also protecting the proprietary interests of all parties; 
        and
            (5) other issues identified by the Secretary.
    (c) Report.--Within 180 days after the establishment of a dedicated 
Rail Account within the Transportation Trust Fund, the Secretary shall 
submit recommendations developed pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), 
including any legislative proposals consistent with such 
recommendations, to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
    (d) Implementation.--The Secretary shall integrate the 
recommendations submitted under subsection (c) into its financial 
assistance programs under subtitle V and section 502 of the Railroad 
Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (45 U.S.C. 822), as 
appropriate. The Secretary may promulgate a rulemaking or rulemakings 
to integrate such recommendations, if appropriate.
    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated to the Secretary such sums as necessary to conduct the 
study described in this section, to remain available until expended.

SEC. 9208. DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES; DISPARITY AND 
              AVAILABILITY STUDY.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation shall continue 
actions to conduct a nationwide disparity and availability study to 
establish the availability and utilization of small business concerns 
owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals (``small disadvantaged businesses'') in publicly funded 
railroad projects.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Small business concern.--The term ``small business 
        concern'' means a small business concern as the term is used in 
        section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). The term 
        ``small business concern'' does not include any concern or 
        group of concerns controlled by the same socially and 
        economically disadvantaged individual or individuals that have 
        average annual gross receipts during the preceding 3 fiscal 
        years in excess of $22,410,000, as adjusted annually by the 
        Secretary for inflation.
            (2) Socially and economically disadvantaged individual.--
        The term ``socially and economically disadvantaged individual'' 
        has the meaning given the term in section 8(d) of the Small 
        Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting 
        regulations issued pursuant to that Act, except that women 
        shall be presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged 
        individuals for purposes of this section.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate a 
report of the results of the nationwide disparity and availability 
study.
    (d) Secretarial Action.--If the Secretary finds a strong basis in 
evidence demonstrating that gender or race discrimination or the 
effects of such discrimination is adversely impacting the award and 
administration of contracts to small disadvantaged businesses in 
Federal financial assistance programs for rail transportation 
administered by the Department of Transportation, the Secretary should 
take appropriate and necessary action to remedy the effects of such 
discrimination.

                    (C) This paragraph is enacted by the Congress--
                            (i) as an exercise of the rulemaking power

                        respectively, and as such is deemed a part of 
                        the rules of each House, respectively, and such 
                        procedures supersede other rules only to the 
                        extent that they are inconsistent therewith;

                        of that House) at any time, in the same manner 
                        and to the same extent as in the case of any

authority shall be treated as direct spending or mandatory spending for 
all purposes.
    (b) Prior Funding of the Highway Trust Fund.--To the extent that 
contract authority from the Highway Trust Fund enacted prior to the 
date of the enactment of this Act produces outlays in fiscal year 2015 
or beyond, as of October 1, 2014, those outlays shall be treated as 
direct spending or mandatory spending for all purposes and shall be 
attributed to the Transportation Trust Fund.

SEC. 11003. TREATMENT FOR STATUTORY PAYGO AND RELATED PURPOSES.

    (a) General Rule.--Except as provided in subsection (b), and 
consistent with the definition of direct spending in section 250(c)(8) 
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as 
amended (2 U.S.C. 900(c)(8)), the following shall be treated as direct 
spending for purposes of Presidential and Congressional budgets and the 
Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (124 Stat. 8):
            (1) Contract authority of the Transportation Trust Fund 
        under this Act, the outlays flowing therefrom, and the outlays 
        flowing from contract authority previously provided from the 
        Highway Trust Fund.
            (2) Except as provided in section 11004, 11005, and 11006 
        of this title, legislation reauthorizing or amending this Act.
    (b) Transitional Rule; Excess Revenues Are Dedicated to Deficit 
Reduction.--For purposes of Presidential and Congressional budgets and 
the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (124 Stat. 8), calculations of 
the budgetary effects of this Act when it is initially enacted shall be 
as follows:
            (1) The baseline projections of total outlays for the 
        Highway Trust Fund and of new outlays for the general fund 
        accounts listed in paragraph (2) shall be treated as offsets to 
        the total level of mandatory outlays of the Transportation 
        Trust Fund resulting from this Act.
                    (A) For this purpose, ``new outlays'' means outlays 
                that flow from contract authority provided by this Act.
                    (B) For this purpose, the budgetary resources to 
                which the baseline projection shall apply are--
                            (i) the discretionary budget authority 
                        provided for fiscal year 2014, for the accounts 
                        listed in paragraph (2); and
                            (ii) the obligation limits for fiscal year 
                        2014 applicable to the Highway Trust Fund, and 
                        shall be projected under section 257(c) of the 
                        Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
                        Act of 1985, as amended (2 U.S.C. 907(c)), 
                        except that contract authority of the Highway 
                        Trust Fund not subject to those obligation 
                        limits shall be projected under section 257(b) 
                        of that Act.
            (2) The general fund programs referred to in paragraph (1) 
        are--
                    (A) the general fund portion of National Highway 
                Traffic Safety Administration, Operations and Research 
                (69X0650).
                    (B) Federal Transit Administration, Administrative 
                Expenses (69 1120).
                    (C) Federal Transit Administration, Capital 
                Investment Grants (69X1134).
                    (D) Federal Transit Administration, Research and 
                University Research Centers (69X1137).
                    (E) Federal Transit Administration, Technical 
                Assistance and Standards Development (69X1142).
                    (F) Federal Railroad Administration, Operating 
                Subsidy Grants to the National Railroad Passenger 
                Corporation (69X0121).
                    (G) Federal Railroad Administration, Capital and 
                Debt Service Grants to the National Railroad Passenger 
                Corporation (69X0125).
                    (H) National Infrastructure Investments (69X0143).
            (3) If the increase in net governmental receipts under this 
        Act, relative to current law, exceeds the increase in mandatory 
        outlays under this Act as measured under paragraph (1) for 
        either or both of the periods covered by the five-year 
        scorecard and the ten-year scorecard established by the 
        Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (124 Stat. 8), the amounts 
        of that excess in net governmental receipts shall not be 
        recorded on those respective scorecards, with the result that 
        this Act shall not be shown as reducing Pay-As-You-Go deficits 
        or increasing Pay-As-You-Go surpluses.

SEC. 11004. SCORING OF CHANGES IN CONTRACT AUTHORITY IN APPROPRIATIONS 
              ACTS.

    Consistent with scorekeeping guidelines in effect from 1990 through 
the enactment of this Act, changes enacted in annual appropriations 
Acts during a session of Congress to the level of contract authority 
provided by this Act shall be scored as discretionary to the extent 
they increase or decrease contract authority in the current year or the 
budget year, and shall be scored as mandatory or direct spending to the 
extent they increase or decrease contract authority in an outyear. To 
the extent any such change in contract authority produces changes in 
estimated outlays in any year, that change in outlays shall be scored 
as discretionary if it is generated by a change in contract authority 
that is scored as discretionary, and shall be scored as mandatory if it 
is generated by a change in contract authority that is scored as 
mandatory.
