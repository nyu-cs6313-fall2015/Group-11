                    ``(A) In general.--In the case of a taxpayer whose 
                principal place of residence for any taxable year is 
                located in a high cost area, there shall be substituted 
                for each specified amount an amount which bears the 
                same proportion to such specified amount as the SPM 
                with respect to such high cost area bears to the 
                national average SPM.
                    ``(B) High cost area.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, the term `high cost area' means any 
                metropolitan statistical area or non-metropolitan area 
                the SPM for which exceeds the national average SPM.
                    ``(C) Specified amounts.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, the term `specified amount' means each of 
                the following:
                            ``(i) The `400' amount contained in the

                        subsection (c)(1)(A).
                    ``(D) SPM.--For purposes of this paragraph--
                            ``(i) In general.--The term `SPM' means, 
                        with respect to each calendar year, the 
                        Supplemental Poverty Measure as determined by 
                        the Bureau of the Census.
                            ``(ii) National average spm.--The national 
                        average SPM shall be determined without regard 
                        to Alaska and Hawaii.
                            ``(iii) Determination for taxable year 
                        based on preceding calendar year.--SPM with 
                        respect to any taxable year shall be determined 
                        on the basis of the calendar year preceding the 
                        calendar year in which the taxable year begins.
                    ``(E) Alternative measure of cost-of-living.--If 
                the Secretary determines that another measure of cost-
                of-living is more appropriate than the SPM for purposes 
                of this paragraph, the Secretary shall use such measure 
                in lieu of the SPM.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act.
