                        conservation contribution (as defined in 
                        subsection (h)(1)) which--

                                Act,
                        shall be allowed to the extent that the 
                        aggregate amount of such contributions does not 
                        exceed the excess of the taxpayer's taxable 
                        income over the amount of charitable 
                        contributions allowable under subparagraph (A).
                            ``(ii) Carryover.--If the aggregate amount 
                        of contributions described in clause (i) 
                        exceeds the limitation of clause (i), such 
                        excess shall be treated (in a manner consistent 
                        with the rules of subsection (d)(2)) as a 
                        charitable contribution to which clause (i) 
                        applies in each of the 15 succeeding years in 
                        order of time.

                        (i), the term `Native Corporation' has the 
                        meaning given such term by section 3(m) of the 
                        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.
                            ``(iv) Valid existing rights preserved.--
                        Nothing in this provision shall be construed to 
                        modify the existing property rights validly 
                        conveyed to Native Corporations under the 
                        Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.''.
