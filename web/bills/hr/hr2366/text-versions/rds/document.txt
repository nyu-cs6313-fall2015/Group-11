                                 AN ACT


 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration 
                   of the centennial of World War I.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``World War I American Veterans 
Centennial Commemorative Coin Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The year 2018 is the 100th anniversary of the signing 
        of the armistice with Germany ending World War I battlefield 
        hostilities.
            (2) On the 6th of April 1917, the United States of America 
        entered World War I by declaring war against Germany.
            (3) Two million American soldiers served overseas during 
        World War I.
            (4) More than four million men and women from the United 
        States served in uniform during World War I.
            (5) The events of 1914 through 1918 shaped the world and 
        the lives of millions of people for decades.
            (6) Over 9 million soldiers worldwide lost their lives 
        between 1914 and 1918.
            (7) The centennial of America's involvement in World War I 
        offers an opportunity for people in the United States to 
        commemorate the commitment of their predecessors.
            (8) Frank Buckles, the last American veteran from World War 
        I died on February 27, 2011.
            (9) He was our last direct American link to the ``war to 
        end all wars''.
            (10) While other great conflicts, including the Civil War, 
        World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, have all 
        been memorialized on United States commemorative coins, there 
        currently exists no coin to honor the brave veterans of World 
        War I.
            (11) The 112th Congress established the World War I
