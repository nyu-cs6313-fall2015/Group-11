of economically beneficial uses of the rights-of-way associated with 
highways constructed with Federal assistance, which shall include--
            (1) the identification of economically beneficial 
        activities that may be carried out with respect to those 
        rights-of-way to ensure that--
                    (A) those rights-of-way are used in the most 
                economically beneficial manner compatible with 
                transportation purposes; and
                    (B) economic underutilization of those rights-of-
                way is minimized to the extent possible;
            (2) an analysis of the costs and benefits, including with 
        respect to safety, of carrying out the economically beneficial 
        activities identified under paragraph (1);
            (3) an analysis of barriers to carrying out the 
        economically beneficial activities identified under paragraph 
        (1); and
            (4) an analysis of the revenue that may be generated by 
        carrying out the economically beneficial activities identified 
        under paragraph (1) and how that revenue may be used to support 
        transportation infrastructure.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress and make available to 
States a report on the results of the study conducted under subsection 
(a), which shall include legislative recommendations based on the
