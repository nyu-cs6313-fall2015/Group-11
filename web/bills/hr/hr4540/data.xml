  <summary>5/1/2014--Introduced.
Accountability in Deferred Prosecution Act of 2014 - Requires the Attorney General to: (1) issue public written guidelines for deferred prosecution agreements and nonprosecution agreements, (2) establish rules for the selection of independent monitors for deferred prosecution agreements, and (3) place the text of deferred prosecution agreements on the public website of the Department of Justice (DOJ). Defines "deferred prosecution agreement" as an agreement between a federal prosecutor and an organization to conditionally defer criminal prosecution of that organization. Defines "nonprosecution agreement" as an agreement between a federal prosecutor and an organization to conditionally decide not to file criminal charges against the organization.

Requires a deferred prosecution agreement to be filed in an appropriate U.S. district court. Requires such court to approve an agreement if it is consistent with the guidelines for such agreements and is in the interests of justice.</summary>
