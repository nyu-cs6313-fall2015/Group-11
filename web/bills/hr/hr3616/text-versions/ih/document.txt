                                 A BILL


 
     To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to distribute 
additional information to Medicare beneficiaries to prevent health care 
                     fraud, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Seniors 
from Health Care Fraud Act of 2013''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Seniors are more vulnerable to fraud than the general 
        population.
            (2) Because seniors require more health care services than 
        the general population, they need more information on health 
        care schemes so they can protect themselves.
            (3) The Department of Health and Human Services should 
        provide more up-to-date information in order to educate seniors 
        on health care scams.

SEC. 2. DISTRIBUTION OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO SENIORS TO PREVENT 
              HEALTH CARE FRAUD.

    Section 1804 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395b-2) is

                                such a scheme would educate criminals 
                                rather than seniors.
