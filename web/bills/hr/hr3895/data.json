Authorizes the Administrator, in lieu of reclassifying an area as nonattainment for ozone, to extend such date if the Administrator: (1) determines that the area is a downwind area with respect to such standard, (2) approves a plan revision for such area prior to a reclassification, (3) determines that the petitioning downwind area has demonstrated that it is affected by transport from an upwind area to a degree that affects the area's ability to attain such standard, and (4) provides measures to ensure that no area downwind of the area receiving the extended attainment date will be affected by transport to a degree that affects the other area's ability to attain such standard. Provides for the withdrawal of a reclassification determination.\n\nRequires such extended attainment date to provide for attainment of such ozone standard in the downwind area as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the new date that the area would have been subject to had it been reclassified.\n\nTitle IX: Sub-basin Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions - Requires the Administrator, in requiring any owner or operator of any facility in the petroleum and natural gas system source category to report greenhouse gas emissions from facilities in such category, to allow such owner or operator to: (1) designate sub-basins consisting of similar fields within a larger basin, and (2) report such emissions from such sub-basins instead of reporting such emissions from the larger basin.\n\nTitle X: Implementation of National Ocean Policy - Prohibits federal departments and agencies from performing activities to implement Executive Order 13547, entitled \"Stewardship of the Ocean, Our Coasts, and the Great Lakes.\"\n\nTitle XI: Other Provisions - Requires: (1) the administrative record compiled by an agency regarding an application for a permit, authorization, or other agency action involving a Priority Energy Project to be the sole and exclusive record for any appeal or review of such action, and (2) such record to be closed upon final agency action and subject to no further evidentiary proceedings or requirements unless requested by the applicant.\n\nRequires an agency to: (1) prepare and submit a Statement of Energy Effects to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), for each proposed significant energy action; and (2) publish such Statement, or a summary of it, in each related notice of proposed rulemaking and in any resulting final rule.\n\nRequires the approval to construct or operate a Priority Energy Project pursuant to any federal permit to remain valid and authorized for the later of: (1) 18 months following the date on which the last permit needed by such Project to commence construction or operation is final and no longer subject to judicial review, (2) three years, or (3) five years in the case of a nationwide permit issued by the Army Corps of Engineers for activities that impact the aquatic environment.\n\nTitle XII: Future Nuclear Energy - Streamline America's Future Energy Nuclear Act - Directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to implement an expedited procedure for issuing a Combined Construction and Operating License.\n\nRequires the NRC to reduce by one-half the time necessary to certify a reactor design and present a certification schedule to Congress within a year of this Act's enactment. Instructs the NRC to outline to Congress an approach that will allow development of technology-neutral guidelines for nuclear plant licensing in the future that would allow for the more seamless entry of new technologies into the marketplace.\n\nDirects DOE and the NRC to reevaluate and accelerate the Next Generation Nuclear Power Plant schedule with the purpose of significant acceleration.\n\n Prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from using the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to arbitrarily prevent uranium mining on federal lands.
