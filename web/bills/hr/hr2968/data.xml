  <summary>8/1/2013--Introduced.
Commute Less Act of 2013 - Requires metropolitan planning organization (MPO) transportation plans to include, among other things, employer and transportation management organization outreach activities and strategies to help create and expand employer-based commuter programs.

Defines "employer-based commuter program" to mean a program implemented by employers to provide their employees with alternatives to driving to and from work in a vehicle occupied by a single individual.

Requires each MPO to establish an employer advisory council consisting of representatives of employers in the transportation management area. Requires each council to develop and maintain a commuter trip reduction plan that identifies area goals for the reduction of vehicle miles traveled during peak commuting hours.

Requires MPO transportation improvement programs (TIPs) to include, among other things, a list of projects identified in a commuter trip reduction plan that help achieve such reduction goals.

Authorizes the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to make a grant to a national nonprofit organization or other entity engaged in efforts relating to employer-based commuter programs to establish and operate an information clearinghouse for employer investment in transportation and employer-based commuter programs.

Requires recipients of federal assistance for the construction of federal-aid highway projects costing $75 million or more, or that will reduce traffic flow for more than 120 days, to prepare congestion mitigation plans that include funding for projects to reduce vehicle miles traveled during peak commuting hours along impacted corridors.

Requires the Secretary to: (1) develop and implement a plan to expand and promote employer-based commuter programs; and (2) report to Congress recommendations on how to better integrate such programs into disaster emergency planning, preparedness, and response activities.</summary>
