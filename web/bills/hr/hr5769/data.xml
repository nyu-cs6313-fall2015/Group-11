 (Sec. 605) Directs the Coast Guard to arrange for an assessment by the National Academy of Sciences of authorities concerning vessels and seamen that have been delegated to the Coast Guard and impact the ability of vessels documented under U.S. laws to effectively compete in international transportation markets. Requires the Coast Guard to report on the assessment.

 (Sec. 610) Bars DHS and EPA from prohibiting a vessel operating within the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve from taking up or discharging ballast water to allow for safe and efficient vessel operation if the uptake or discharge meets all federal and state ballast water management requirements that would apply if the area were not a marine sanctuary.
