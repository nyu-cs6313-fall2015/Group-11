(This prohibition does not apply with respect to garbage discharged overboard, other discharges when the vessel is operating in a capacity other than as a means of transportation, discharges of ballast water held in ships to increase stability, or any discharge that contributes to a violation of a water quality standard or poses an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment.)\n\n (Sec. 603) Directs DOT to submit to Congress a national maritime strategy that:\n\n identifies federal regulations that reduce the competitiveness of U.S. flag vessels in international markets; identifies the impact of reduced cargo flow due to reductions in the number of Armed Forces members stationed or deployed outside the United States; and includes recommendations to make U.S. flag vessels more competitive in shipping routes, and to enhance U.S. shipbuilding capability. Requires DOT to recommend strategies to increase the use of U.S. flag vessels to carry imports and exports, third-party inspection and certification authorities, and short sea transportation routes.\n\n (Sec. 604) Exempts the vessel \"John Craig\" (United States official number D1110613) from a requirement that passenger vessel operators be licensed by DHS, provided that Kentucky has implemented a similar licensing requirement and the vessel is operating on a specified portion of the River.\n\n Authorizes DHS to issue a coastwise endorsement to the \u201cF/V Western Challenger\u201d (IMO number 5388108). (A coastwise endorsement entitles a vessel to employment in unrestricted coastwise trade, dredging, towing, and any other employment for which a registry or fishery endorsement is not required.)\n\n (Sec. 605) Directs the Coast Guard to arrange for an assessment by the National Academy of Sciences of authorities concerning vessels and seamen that have been delegated to the Coast Guard and impact the ability of vessels documented under U.S. laws to effectively compete in international transportation markets. Requires the Coast Guard to report on the assessment.\n\n (Sec. 606) Requires DHS to report on the status of the final rule that relates to the Coast Guard\u2019s Notice of Arrival and Departure (NOAD) and Automatic Identification System (AIS) requirements.\n\n (Sec. 607) Authorizes the Coast Guard to convey 0.2 acres of property at 527 River Street in Rochester, New York to Rochester, New York.\n\n (Sec. 608) Authorizes the Department of the Interior to convey 0.86 acres of fast lands in the narrows of Puget Sound, Washington to Gig Harbor, Washington upon the Coast Guard's relinquishment of the property.\n\n (Sec. 609) Deems the vessel assigned U.S. official number 1205366 (rebuilt after a fire) to be a new vessel on the date of delivery of the vessel after January 1, 2012, from a privately owned U.S. shipyard if no encumbrances are on record with the Coast Guard at the time of the issuance of the new certificate of documentation.\n\n (Sec. 610) Bars DHS and EPA from prohibiting a vessel operating within the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve from taking up or discharging ballast water to allow for safe and efficient vessel operation if the uptake or discharge meets all federal and state ballast water management requirements that would apply if the area were not a marine sanctuary.\n\n (Sec. 611) Requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to allocate and assign a specified number of parking spaces at DHS' St. Elizabeth Campus to Coast Guard personnel assigned to the Campus based on a schedule."
