        safety net clinic and through the use of the facilities and 
        equipment, including qualified electronic health records, of 
        the clinic. The determination of whether an eligible 
        professional is a QSNC-based eligible professional shall be 
        made on the basis of the site of service (as defined by the

qualified safety net clinic may demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology by such clinic for purposes of satisfying the 
requirement described in paragraph (6)(C)(i)(II).

receive payments described in paragraph (1)(B) before the date on which 
the Secretary establishes the procedure described in subparagraph (A). 
On and after that date, a qualified safety net clinic may receive such 
payments if the qualified safety net clinic notifies the Secretary that 
the qualified safety net clinic elects to receive such payments in lieu 
of the Secretary making payments described in paragraph (1)(A) to the 
eligible professionals who practice predominately in the qualified 
safety net clinic.
    ``(C) On or after the date that the Secretary establishes the 
procedure described in subparagraph (A), an eligible professional who 
practices predominately in a qualified safety net clinic, as described 
in paragraph (2)(A)(iii), shall not be eligible to receive payments 
described in paragraph (1)(A) if the qualified safety net clinic 
receives payments described in paragraph (1)(B).''.
