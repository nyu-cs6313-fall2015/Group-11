  To amend the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act to provide for 
State and tribal management and protection of wild free-roaming horses 
                  and burros, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Wild Horse Oversight Act''.

              HORSES AND BURROS.

    Public Law 92-195 (commonly known as the ``Wild Free-Roaming Horses 
and Burros Act'') is amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 12. STATE AND TRIBAL MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION.

    ``(a) In General.--Except as provided by subsection (b), at the 
request of the legislature or Governor of a State or the governing body 
of a federally recognized Indian tribe, the Secretary of the Interior 
and the Secretary of Agriculture shall allow the State or federally 
recognized Indian tribe to assume all management and protection 
functions under this Act regarding wild free-roaming horses and burros 
on land within the boundaries of the State or federally recognized 
Indian tribe. After a State or federally recognized Indian tribe 
assumes such functions, wild free-roaming horses and burros shall be 
managed by the State or federally recognized Indian tribe in accordance 
with this Act and in the same manner as any other non-federally 
regulated species regarding functions not specified in this Act.
    ``(b) Inventory.--The Secretary concerned shall continue to 
maintain the inventory required by section 3(b)(1).''.
