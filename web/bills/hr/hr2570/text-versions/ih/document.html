                                 A BILL


 
    To exempt the vessel John Craig from certain requirements when 
 operating on a portion of the Kentucky River, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Valley View Ferry Preservation Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Valley View Ferry is the oldest continuously 
        operated ferry west of the Appalachian Mountains and the third 
        oldest in the United States.
            (2) The vessel utilized by the Valley View Ferry, the 
        vessel John Craig, does not have steering capabilities; 
        instead, it is attached to 2 overhead, \7/8\ inch diameter 
        cables that guide the vessel to each side of the river.
            (3) The crossing distance for the Valley View Ferry is 
        approximately 500 feet.
            (4) The Valley View Ferry is located on the Kentucky River 
        between the cities of Lexington, Nicholasville, and Richmond in 
        Central Kentucky.
            (5) The John Craig is a 24-ton vessel that is 60 feet long 
        and 14 feet wide.
            (6) The Valley View Ferry does not carry vehicles with 
        combustible materials.
            (7) The Valley View Ferry is a toll-free ferry.
            (8) Federal regulations changed in 2006, which established 
        a new requirement that the Valley View Ferry comply with all 
        Coast Guard inspection and licensing regulations.
            (9) The new licensing regulations for operators of the 
        vessel John Craig threaten to close the historic ferry.
            (10) While the Coast Guard should maintain safety 
        inspection authority with respect to the Valley View Ferry, 
        licensing authority should reside with the Commonwealth of 
        Kentucky.
