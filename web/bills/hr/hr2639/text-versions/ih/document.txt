        paragraph (1), the secondary party shall be treated as a 
        nonparty to the action against the primary party for purposes 
        of discovery, hearings, trial, or otherwise. The stay shall 
        continue until such time that a final adjudication in the 
        action against the primary party has been entered and all 
        appeals thereof exhausted.
    ``(b) Other Authority Not Affected.--Nothing in this section shall 
be construed as abrogating a court's discretion to grant any stay or

Circumstances.--If, under any provision of Federal law (including the
