Preempts state law and regulations concerning a credit repair organization to the extent they would apply to consumer reporting agencies subject to this Act.\n\nDirects the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to study whether, in addition to these persons, any other person should be exempt from the Credit Repair Organizations Act."
