Limits to one hour any debate on the bill. Prohibits the measure from being amendable and a motion to commit from being in order.\n\nApplies similar procedures for Senate consideration of the House passed bill.\n\nMakes it out of order in the Senate to consider the bill before the passage of the conference report on the budget resolution for its fiscal year.\n\nIncreases the public debt limit from $14,294,000,000,000 to $17,072,810,000,000."
