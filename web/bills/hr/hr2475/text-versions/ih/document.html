                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Attorney General to disclose each decision, order, or 
  opinion of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that includes 
 significant legal interpretation of section 501 or 702 of the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 unless such disclosure is not in 
   the national security interest of the United States and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ending Secret Law Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Secret law is inconsistent with democratic governance. 
        In order for the rule of law to prevail, the requirements of 
        the law must be publicly discoverable.
            (2) The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh 
        Circuit stated in 1998 that the ``idea of secret laws is 
        repugnant''.
            (3) The open publication of laws and directives is a 
        defining characteristic of government of the United States. The 
        first Congress of the United States mandated that every ``law, 
        order, resolution, and vote [shall] be published in at least 
        three of the public newspapers printed within the United 
        States''.
            (4) The practice of withholding decisions of the Foreign 
        Intelligence Surveillance Court is at odds with the United 
        States tradition of open publication of law.
            (5) The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court 
        acknowledges that such Court has issued legally significant 
        interpretations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 
        1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) that are not accessible to the 
        public.
            (6) The exercise of surveillance authorities under the 
        Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 
        et seq.), as interpreted by secret court opinions, potentially 
        implicates the communications of United States persons who are 
        necessarily unaware of such surveillance.
            (7) Section 501 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
        Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861), as amended by section 215 of the 
        USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107-56; 115 Stat. 287), authorizes 
        the Federal Bureau of Investigation to require the production 
        of ``any tangible things'' and the extent of such authority, as 
        interpreted by secret court opinions, has been concealed from 
        the knowledge and awareness of the people of the United States.
            (8) In 2010, the Department of Justice and the Office of 
        the Director of National Intelligence established a process to 
        review and declassify opinions of the Foreign Intelligence 
        Surveillance Court, but more than two years later no 
        declassifications have been made.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that each decision, order, or opinion 
issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court or the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review that includes significant 
construction or interpretation of section 501 or section 702 of the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1861 and 
1881a) should be declassified in a manner consistent with the 
protection of national security, intelligence sources and methods, and 
other properly classified and sensitive information.

SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT FOR DISCLOSURE OF DECISIONS, ORDERS, AND OPINIONS 
              OF THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT.
