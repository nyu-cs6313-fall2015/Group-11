Sec. 301. Preservation of United States national security objectives.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.

    Congress finds and declares the following:
            (1) United States international broadcasting exists to 
        advance the United States' interests and values by presenting 
        accurate, objective, and comprehensive news and information, 
        which is the foundation for democratic governance, to societies 
        that lack a free media.
            (2) Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
        states that ``[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion 
        and expression'', and that ``this right includes freedom to 
        hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and 
        impart information and ideas through any media and regardless 
        of frontiers''.
            (3) Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before the 
        Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives on 
        January 23, 2013, that the Broadcasting Board of Governors 
        (BBG) ``is practically a defunct agency in terms of its 
        capacity to be able to tell a message around the world. So 
        we're abdicating the ideological arena and need to get back 
        into it.''.
            (4) The BBG, which was created by Congress to oversee the 
        United States' international broadcasting in the wake of the 
        Cold War, has, because of structural and managerial issues, had 
        limited success to date in both coordinating the various 
        components of the international broadcasting framework and 
        managing the day-to-day operations of the Federal components of 
        the international broadcasting framework.
            (5) The lack of regular attendance by board members and a 
        periodic inability to form a quorum have plagued the BBG and, 
        as a result, it has been functionally incapable of running the 
        agency.
            (6) The board of governors has only achieved the full slate 
        of all nine governors for seven of its 17 years of existence, 
        which highlights the difficulties of confirming and retaining 
        governors under the current structure.
            (7) Both the Department of State's Office of Inspector 
        General and the Government Accountability Office have issued 
        reports which outline a severely dysfunctional organizational 
        structure of the Broadcasting Board of Governors.
            (8) The Inspector General of the Department of State 
        concluded in its January 2013 report that dysfunction of the 
        BBG stems from ``a flawed legislative structure and acute 
        internal dissension''.
            (9) The Inspector General of the Department of State also 
        found that the BBG's structure of nine part-time members 
        ``cannot effectively supervise all United States Government-
        supported, civilian international broadcasting'', and its 
        involvement in day-to-day operations has impeded normal 
        management functions.
            (10) The Government Accountability Office report determined 
        that there was significant overlap among the BBG's languages 
        services, and that the BBG did not systematically consider the 
        financial cost of overlap.
            (11) According to the Office of the Inspector General, the 
        BBG's Office of Contracts is not in compliance with the Federal 
        Acquisition Regulation, lacks appropriate contract oversight, 
        and violates the Anti-Deficiency Act. The Office of the 
        Inspector General also determined that the Broadcasting Board 
        of Governors has not adequately performed full and open 
        competitions or price determinations, has entered into hundreds 
        of personal service contracts without statutory authority, and 
        contractors regularly work without valid contracts in place.
            (12) The size and make-up of the BBG workforce should be 
        closely examined, given the agency's broader broadcasting and 
        technical mission, as well as changing media technologies.
            (13) The BBG should be structured to ensure that more 
        taxpayer dollars are dedicated to the substantive, 
        broadcasting, and information-related elements of the agency's 
        mission.
            (14) The lack of a coherent and well defined mission of the 
        Voice of America has led to programming that duplicates the 
        efforts of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, 
        RFE/RL, Incorporated, and the Middle East Broadcasting 
        Networks, Incorporated that results in inefficient use of tax-
        payer funding.
            (15) The annual survey conducted by the ``Partnership for 
        Public Service'' consistently ranks the Broadcasting Board of 
        Governors at or near the bottom of all Federal agencies in 
        terms of ``overall best places to work'' and ``the extent to 
        which employees feel their skills and talents are used 
        effectively''. The consistency of these low scores point to 
        structural, cultural, and functional problems at the 
        Broadcasting Board of Governors.
            (16) The Federal and non-Federal organizations that 
        comprise the United States international broadcasting framework 
        have different, yet complementary, missions that necessitate 
        coordination at all levels of management.
            (17) The Broadcasting Board of Governors has an 
        overabundance of senior civil service positions, defined here 
        as full-time employees encumbering GS-14 and GS-15 positions on 
        the General Schedule pay scale.
            (18) United States international broadcasting should seek 
        to leverage public-private partnerships, including the 
        licensing of content and the use of technology owned or 
        operated by non-governmental sources, where possible to expand 
        outreach capacity.
            (19) Shortwave broadcasting has been an important method of 
        communication that should be utilized in regions as a component 
        of United States international broadcasting where a critical 
        need for the platform exists.
            (20) Congressional action is necessary at this time to 
        improve international broadcasting operations, strengthen the 
        United States' public diplomacy efforts, enhance the grantee 
        surrogate broadcasting effort, restore focus to news, 
        programming, and content, and maximize the value of Federal and 
        non-Federal resources that are dedicated to public diplomacy 
        and international broadcasting.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            (1) To provide objective, accurate, credible, and 
        comprehensive news and information to societies that lack 
        freedom of expression and information.
            (2) To improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and 
        flexibility of United States international broadcasting to 
        allow it to adapt to constantly changing political and media 
        environments through clarification of missions, improved 
        coordination, and organizational restructuring.
            (3) To coordinate the complementary efforts of the 
        Department of State and United States international 
        broadcasting.
            (4) To create a United States international broadcasting 
        framework that more effectively leverages the broadcasting 
        tools available and creates specialization of expertise in 
        mission oriented programming, while minimizing waste and 
        inefficiency.
            (5) To improve United States international broadcasting 
        workforce effectiveness, security, and satisfaction.

        programming and content for the millions of people around the

        content from indigenous media outlets;
            (3) the Voice of America's success over more than seven

        America would benefit substantially from a recalibration of 
        Federal international broadcasting agencies and resources, 
        which would provide the Voice of America with greater mission 
        focus and flexibility in the deployment of news, programming, 
        and content.
