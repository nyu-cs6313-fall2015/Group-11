Modifies the unemployment requirement to require a signed affidavit from the unemployed individual that, during the 27-week period ending on the hiring date, such individual: (1) was receiving federal or state unemployment compensation, or (2) was unemployed and would have received unemployment compensation except for having exhausted the right to receive such compensation during such period."
