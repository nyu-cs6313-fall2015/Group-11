              PROPERTY EXPENDITURES.

                        fuel to heat a dwelling unit located in the 
                        United States and used as a residence by the 
                        taxpayer, or to heat water for use in such a 
                        dwelling unit, and
                            ``(ii) which has a thermal efficiency 
                        rating of at least 75 percent (measured by the 
                        higher heating value of the fuel).
                    ``(B) Biomass fuel.--For purposes of this section, 
                the term `biomass fuel' means any plant-derived fuel 
                available on a renewable or recurring basis, including

                        of the fuel) and which provide thermal energy 
                        in the form of heat, hot water, or steam for 
                        space heating, air conditioning, domestic hot 
                        water, or industrial process heat, but only
