Directs the Secretary to develop, maintain, and update a comprehensive workforce strategy to enhance the readiness, capacity, training, recruitment, and retention of DHS's cybersecurity workforce, which shall include a description of:\n\n a multi-phased recruitment plan, a 5-year implementation plan, a 10-year projection of the cybersecurity workforce needs of DHS, any obstacle impeding the hiring and development of such workforce, and any gap in the existing DHS cybersecurity workforce and a plan to fill such gap. Requires the Secretary to submit to the appropriate congressional committees: (1) annual updates on such assessment and on the Secretary's progress in carrying out such strategy; and (2) a report on the feasibility, cost, and benefits of establishing a Cybersecurity Fellowship Program to offer a tuition payment plan for individuals pursuing undergraduate and doctoral degrees who agree to work for DHS for an agreed-upon period."
