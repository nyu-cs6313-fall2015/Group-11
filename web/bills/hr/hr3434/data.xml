Parental Accountability for Reducing Child Poverty Act - Amends part A (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) (TANF) of title IV of the Social Security Act (SSA) to prohibit a state receiving a TANF grant from using any part of it to provide assistance to a parent, caretaker relative, or legal guardian of a child age 6 to 19 who is not attending school for at least the state-required number of days per year. Makes a similar requirement for home schooled children.
