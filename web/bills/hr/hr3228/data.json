Provides for the release of as much information regarding the facts and analysis in such decisions as is consistent with legitimate national security concerns.\n\nPermits the Advocate to petition the FISA Court, petition review pool, or FISA Court of Review for the public disclosure of decisions and related documents previously designated as classified or for the release of an unclassified summary of such materials."
