  <summary>3/27/2014--Introduced.
Business Risk Planning Act - Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to: (1) prescribe a rule for public reporting of swap transactions (including price and volume data) in illiquid markets that are not cleared and entered into by a non-financial entity that is hedging or mitigating commercial risk, and (2) ensure that such swap transaction information is publicly available no sooner than 30 days after it has been executed or at a later date the CFTC determines appropriate to protect the identity of participants and positions in illiquid markets and to prevent the elimination or reduction of market liquidity.

Defines an "illiquid market" as one in which there is relatively little volume and infrequent trading in swaps.</summary>
