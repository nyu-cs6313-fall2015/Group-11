                                 A BILL


 
 To affirm the religious freedom of taxpayers who are conscientiously 
opposed to participation in war, to provide that the income, estate, or 
 gift tax payments of such taxpayers be used for nonmilitary purposes, 
  to create the Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund to receive such tax 
    payments, to improve revenue collection, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The free exercise of religion is an inalienable right, 
        protected by the First Amendment of the United States 
        Constitution.
            (2) Congress reaffirmed this right in the Religious Freedom 
        Restoration Act of 1993, as amended in 1998, which prohibits 
        the Federal Government from imposing a substantial burden on 
        the free exercise of religion unless it demonstrates that a 
        compelling government interest is achieved by the least 
        restrictive means.
            (3) Many people immigrated to America (including members of 
        the Quaker, Mennonite, and Church of the Brethren faiths) to 
        escape persecution for their refusal to participate in warfare, 
        yet during the First World War hundreds of conscientious 
        objectors were imprisoned in America for their beliefs. Some 
        died while incarcerated as a result of mistreatment.
            (4) During the Second World War, ``alternative civilian 
        service'' was established in lieu of military service, by the 
        Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, to accommodate a 
        wide spectrum of religious beliefs and practices. Subsequent 
        case law also has expanded these exemptions, and has described 
        this policy as one of ``. . . long standing tradition in this 
        country . . .'' affording ``the important value of reconciling 
        individuality of belief with practical exigencies whenever 
        possible. It dates back to colonial times and has been 
        perpetuated in State and Federal conscription statutes,'' and 
        ``has roots deeply embedded in history.'' (Welsh v. United 
        States, 1970, Justice Harlan concurring). During and since the 
        Second World War thousands of conscientious objectors provided 
        essential staff for mental hospitals and volunteered as human 
        test subjects for arduous medical experiments, and provided 
        other service for the national health, safety and interest.
            (5) Conscientious objectors have sought alternative service 
        for their tax payments since that time. They request legal 
        relief from government seizure of their homes, livestock, 
        automobiles, and other property; and from having bank accounts 
        attached, wages garnished, fines imposed, and imprisonment 
        threatened, to compel them to violate their personal and 
        religious convictions.
            (6) Conscientious objection to participation in war in any 
        form based upon moral, ethical, or religious beliefs is 
        recognized in Federal law, with provision for alternative 
        service; but no such provision exists for taxpayers who are 
        conscientious objectors and who are compelled to participate in 
        war through the payment of taxes to support military 
        activities.
            (7) The Joint Committee on Taxation has certified that a 
        tax trust fund, providing for conscientious objector taxpayers 
        to pay their full taxes for non-military purposes, would 
        increase Federal revenues.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

provides.
    (b) Military Purpose.--For purposes of this Act, the term 
``military purpose'' means any activity or program which any agency of 
the Government conducts, administers, or sponsors and which effects an 
augmentation of military forces or of defensive and offensive

and estate taxes paid by or on behalf of taxpayers who are designated

year. Such report shall be printed in the Congressional Record upon 
receipt by the Committees. The privacy of individuals using the Fund 
shall be protected.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that any 
increase in revenue to the Treasury resulting from the creation of the 
Religious Freedom Peace Tax Fund shall be allocated in a manner 
consistent with the purposes of the Fund.
