                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 10, United States Code, to ensure that members of the 
 reserve components of the Armed Forces who have served on active duty 
 or performed active service since September 11, 2001, in support of a 
 contingency operation or in other emergency situations receive credit 
 for such service in determining eligibility for early receipt of non-
          regular service retired pay, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Guardsmen and Reservists 
Parity for Patriots Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since September 11, 2001, members of the reserve 
        components of the Armed Forces have been sent into harm's way 
        and fought alongside members of the regular components of the 
        Armed Forces.
            (2) Between September 11, 2001, and January 28, 2008, more 
        than 600,000 members of the reserve components have been 
        mobilized in support of military operations in Iraq and 
        Afghanistan and for other contingency operations.
            (3) More than 142,000 members of the reserve components 
        have been mobilized more than once during this same period.
            (4) In recognition of the service performed by these 
        members of the reserve components, Congress enacted section 647 
        of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 
        (Public Law 110-181, 122 Stat. 160), which amended section 
        12731 of title 10, United States Code, to offer an earlier 
        retirement benefit for members of the reserve components who 
        are mobilized in support of contingency operations.
            (5) However, the amendment made by section 647 of the 
        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 only 
        considers service performed after the date of the enactment of 
        such Act, January 28, 2008, and this effective date fails to 
        recognize the service and sacrifice made by members of the 
        reserve components between September 11, 2001, and January 28, 
        2008.

SEC. 3. CONSIDERATION OF SERVICE SINCE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, IN 
              DETERMINING EARLY ELIGIBILITY FOR RECEIPT OF NON-REGULAR 
              SERVICE RETIRED PAY.

    Section 12731(f)(2)(A) of title 10, United States Code, as added by 
section 647 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2008 (Public Law 110-181, 122 Stat. 160), is amended--
            (1) by striking ``January 28, 2008'' and inserting 
        ``September 11, 2001''; and
            (2) by striking ``in any fiscal year after such date'' and 
        inserting ``such duty or service after that date during fiscal 
        year 2002 and any subsequent fiscal year''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
