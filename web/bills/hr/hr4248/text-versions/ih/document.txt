To require institutions of higher education to disseminate information 
 with respect to the completion rates, employment rates, and retention 
                rates of recipients of GI Bill funding.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Education Outcomes Act''.

SEC. 2. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION WITH RESPECT TO RECIPIENTS OF GI BILL 
              FUNDING.

    Section 485(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1092) 
is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)(Q)--
                    (A) in clause (iii), by striking ``and''; and
                    (B) by adding ``and'' at the end of clause (iv); 
                and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
                            ``(v) are recipients of educational 
                        assistance provided under chapter 30 or 33 of 
                        title 38, United States Code, or chapter 1606 
                        of title 10, United States Code;''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) The information disseminated under subparagraphs (E), 
        (L), (R), (S), and (U) of paragraph (1) shall be disaggregated 
        by the recipients of educational assistance provided under 
        chapter 30 or 33 of title 38, United States Code, or chapter 
        1606 of title 10, United States Code, if the number of students 
        in such subgroup is sufficient to yield statistically reliable 
        information and reporting will not reveal personally 
        identifiable information about an individual student. If such 
        number is not sufficient for such purposes, then the 
        institution shall note that the institution enrolled too few of 
        such students to so disclose or report with confidence and 
        confidentiality.''.
                                 <all>
