  <summary>7/29/2014--Introduced.
Healthy Housing Council Act of 2014 - Establishes in the executive branch an independent Interagency Council on Healthy Housing.

Requires the Council to: (1) review federal programs and services that provide housing, health, energy, or environmental services to families and individuals; (2) monitor, evaluate, and recommend improvements in programs and services administered, funded, or financed by federal, state, and local agencies; (3) recommend ways to reduce duplication among federal programs and services; and (4) ensure collaboration among and within agencies in the provision and availability of such programs and services.

Directs the Comptroller General (GAO) to report to Congress an analysis of the same issues as, and updating the findings and conclusions of, the GAO report to the Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Government Reform of January 1999 entitled "Lead Poisoning: Federal Health Care Programs Are Not Effectively Reaching At-Risk Children" (GAO/HEHS-99-18).</summary>
