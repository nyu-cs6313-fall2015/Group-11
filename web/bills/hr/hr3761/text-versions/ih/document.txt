 To properly define and distinguish between decorative hearth products 
                       and vented hearth heaters.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. VENTED HEARTH HEATERS AND DECORATIVE HEARTH PRODUCTS.

    Section 321 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 
6291) is amended by inserting at the end the following:
            ``(67) Vented hearth heater.--The term `vented hearth 
        heater' means a vented gas fireplace, vented fireplace insert, 
        or vented stove--
                    ``(A) for which any AFUE representation, or 
                representation with respect to P.4 efficiencies 
                required for products sold in Canada, is made in any 
                manufacturer advertising or literature;
                    ``(B) that is certified to the ANSI Z21.88 standard 
                or identified in any manufacturer literature or 
                advertising as a `heater-rated' product; or
                    ``(C) that is equipped by the manufacturer with a 
                thermostatic control.
            ``(68) Decorative hearth product.--The term `decorative 
        hearth product' means a vented gas fireplace, vented fireplace 
        insert, vented stove, or vented gas log set that--
                    ``(A) is not certified to the ANSI Z21.88 standard 
                and, in the case of a vented gas fireplace, vented 
                fireplace insert, or vented stove, is certified to the 
                ANSI Z21.50 standard;
                    ``(B) is sold without a thermostat and with a 
                warranty provision expressly voiding all manufacturer 
                warranties in the event the product is used with a 
                thermostat; and
                    ``(C) contains no energy efficiency representations 
                other than P.4 efficiencies required for products sold 
                in Canada.
        Decorative hearth products shall not be considered direct 
        heating equipment for purposes of this part. A vented gas 
        fireplace, vented fireplace insert, vented stove, or vented gas 
        log set that is not a decorative hearth product shall be 
        considered direct heating equipment for purposes of this 
        part.''.
                                 <all>
