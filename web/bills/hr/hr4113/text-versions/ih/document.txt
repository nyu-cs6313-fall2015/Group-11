                community;
                    ``(B) is located in an area that is served by a 
                public water system with fewer than 3,000 connections 
                or is located in an area with no public water system;
                    ``(C) is located in an agricultural area with rural 
                residences served by a public water system or by 
                private wells; or
                    ``(D) is not only a benefit to the rural community 
                served by the project, but also a benefit to additional 
                regional partners.''.
    (b) Definition of Alternative Water Source.--Section 220(i)(1) of 
such Act (33 U.S.C. 1300(i)(1)) is amended--

                groundwater supplies by delivering surface water 
                instead of groundwater''; and
            (2) in the second sentence by inserting before the period 
        at the end the following: ``unless the project requires such 
        facilities to deliver the alternative water supply''.
