                                 An Act


 
 To award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal to Addie Mae Collins, 
 Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley to commemorate the 
  lives they lost 50 years ago in the bombing of the Sixteenth Street 
  Baptist Church, where these 4 little Black girls' ultimate sacrifice 
           served as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
    The Congress Finds the following:
        (1) September 15, 2013, will mark 50 years since the lives of 
    Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia 
    Wesley were suddenly taken by a bomb planted in the Sixteenth 
    Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
        (2) The senseless and premature death of these 4 little Black 
    girls sparked ``The Movement that Changed the World''.
        (3) On that tragic Sunday in September of 1963, the world took 
    notice of the violence inflicted in the struggle for equal rights.
        (4) The fact that 4 innocent children lost their lives as they 
    prepared for Sunday School shook the world's conscience.
        (5) This tragedy galvanized the Civil Rights Movement and 
    sparked a surge of momentum that helped secure the passage of the 
    Civil Rights Act of 1964 and later the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by 
    President Lyndon B. Johnson.
        (6) Justice was delayed for these 4 little Black girls and 
    their families until 2002, 39 years after the bombing, when the 
    last of the 4 Klansmen responsible for the bombing was charged and 
    convicted of the crime.
        (7) The 4 little Black girls are emblematic of so many who have 
    lost their lives for the cause of freedom and equality, including 
    Virgil Ware and James Johnny Robinson who were children also killed 
    within hours of the 1963 church bombing.
        (8) The legacy that these 4 little Black girls left will live 
    on in the minds and hearts of us all for generations to come.
        (9) Their extraordinary sacrifice sparked real and lasting 
    change as Congress began to aggressively pass legislation that 
    ensured equality.
        (10) Sixteenth Street Baptist Church remains a powerful symbol 
    of the movement for civil and human rights and will host the 50th 
    anniversary ceremony on Sunday, September 15, 2013.
        (11) It is befitting that Congress bestow the highest civilian 
    honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, in 2013 to the 4 little Black 
    girls, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and 
    Cynthia Wesley, posthumously in recognition of the 50th 
    commemoration of the historical significance of the bombing of the 
    Sixteenth Street Baptist Church.
