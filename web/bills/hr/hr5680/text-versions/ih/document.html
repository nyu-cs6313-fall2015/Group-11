exposures covered in a registry described in subsection (a)(3). Under 
such agreement, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies 
shall submit to the Secretary on a biennial basis a report on toxic 
substance exposure-related illnesses. Such report shall include--
            (1) a review of all scientific studies and research on the 
        association between toxic substance exposures and specific 
        diseases covered in such a registry, including the level of 
        association between such exposures and the specific diseases; 
        and
            (2) recommendations for future research.
    (c) Research Into the Effects of Toxic Exposure on Second and Third 
Generations.--In addition to the reviews under subsection (b), the 
Secretary shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of 
Sciences to review published scientific information and studies on the 
health effects on the children and grandchildren of veterans with toxic 
exposures covered in a registry described in subsection (a)(3). Under 
such agreement, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies 
shall submit to the Secretary on a biennial basis a report on toxic 
substance exposure-related illnesses. Such report shall include--
            (1) a review of all scientific studies and research on the 
        association between toxic substance exposures and specific 
        diseases covered in such a registry in such children and 
        grandchildren, including the level of association between such 
        exposures and the specific diseases; and
            (2) recommendations for future research.
    (d) Research.--The Secretary shall use the reviews conducted under 
subsections (b) and (c) to inform the decisions made by the Secretary 
with respect to selecting the research to be conducted or funded by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary shall submit to the 
Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the 
Senate a report describing how the Secretary used such reviews to make 
such selections.

              associated with toxic exposures
    ``(a) Presumption.--(1) For purposes of section 1110 of this title, 
and subject to section 1113 of this title, each illness, if any, 
described in paragraph (2) shall be considered to have been incurred in 
or aggravated by service referred to in that paragraph, notwithstanding 
that there is no record of evidence of such illness during the period 
of such service.
    ``(2) An illness referred to in paragraph (1) is any diagnosed or 
undiagnosed illness that--
            ``(A) the Secretary determines in regulations prescribed 
        under this section to warrant a presumption of service 
        connection by reason of having a positive association with 
        exposure to a toxic substance covered in the master registry; 
        and
            ``(B) becomes manifest within the period, if any, 
        prescribed in such regulations in a veteran who served in the 
        Armed Forces and by reason of such service experienced such 
        exposure.
    ``(3) For purposes of this subsection, a veteran who served in the 
Armed Forces in a location recognized under the master registry as 
being a source of exposure and has an illness described in paragraph 
(2) shall be presumed to have been exposed by reason of such service 
unless there is conclusive evidence to establish that the veteran was 
not so exposed by reason of such service.
    ``(b)(1)(A) Whenever the Secretary makes a determination described 
in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall prescribe regulations 
providing that a presumption of service connection is warranted for the 
illness covered by that determination for purposes of this section.
    ``(B) A determination referred to in subparagraph (A) is a 
determination based on sound medical and scientific evidence that a 
positive association exists between--
            ``(i) the exposure of humans or animals to a toxic 
        substance covered in the master registry; and
            ``(ii) the occurrence of a diagnosed or undiagnosed illness 
        in humans or animals.
    ``(2)(A) In making determinations for purposes of paragraph (1), 
the Secretary shall take into account--
            ``(i) the reports submitted to the Secretary by the 
        National Academy of Sciences under section 2(b) of the 
        Veterans' Toxic Wounds Research Act of 2014; and
            ``(ii) all other sound medical and scientific information 
        and analyses available to the Secretary.
    ``(B) In evaluating any report, information, or analysis for 
purposes of making such determinations, the Secretary shall take into 
consideration whether the results are statistically significant, are 
capable of replication, and withstand peer review.
    ``(3) An association between the occurrence of an illness in humans 
or animals and exposure to a toxic substance covered in the master 
registry shall be considered to be positive for purposes of this 
subsection if the credible evidence for the association is equal to or 
outweighs the credible evidence against the association.
    ``(c)(1) Not later than 60 days after the date on which the 
Secretary receives a report from the National Academy of Sciences under 
section 2(b) of the Veterans' Toxic Wounds Research Act of 2014, the 
Secretary shall determine whether or not a presumption of service 
connection is warranted for each illness, if any, covered by the 
report.
    ``(2) If the Secretary determines under this subsection that a 
presumption of service connection is warranted, the Secretary shall, 
not later than 60 days after making the determination, issue proposed 
regulations setting forth the Secretary's determination.
    ``(3)(A) If the Secretary determines under this subsection that a 
presumption of service connection is not warranted, the Secretary 
shall, not later than 60 days after making the determination, publish 
in the Federal Register a notice of the determination. The notice shall 
include an explanation of the scientific basis for the determination.
    ``(B) If an illness already presumed to be service connected under 
this section is subject to a determination under subparagraph (A), the 
Secretary shall, not later than 60 days after publication of the notice 
under that subparagraph, issue proposed regulations removing the 
presumption of service connection for the illness.
    ``(4) Not later than 90 days after the date on which the Secretary 
issues any proposed regulations under this subsection, the Secretary 
shall issue final regulations. Such regulations shall be effective on 
the date of issuance.
    ``(d) Whenever the presumption of service connection for an illness 
under this section is removed under subsection (c)--
            ``(1) a veteran who was awarded compensation for the 
        illness on the basis of the presumption before the effective 
        date of the removal of the presumption shall continue to be 
        entitled to receive compensation on that basis; and
            ``(2) a survivor of a veteran who was awarded dependency 
        and indemnity compensation for the death of a veteran resulting 
        from the illness on the basis of the presumption before that 
        date shall continue to be entitled to receive dependency and 
        indemnity compensation on that basis.
    ``(e) Master Registry Defined.--In this section, the term `master 
registry' means the registry of veterans who experienced toxic 
exposures established by section 2 of the Veterans' Toxic Wounds
