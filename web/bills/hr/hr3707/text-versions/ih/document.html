To ensure the emergency protection of Iranian dissidents living in Camp 
 Liberty/Hurriya and to provide for their admission as refugees to the 
                             United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. STATEMENT OF U.S. POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States to--
            (1) take all necessary and appropriate steps in accordance 
        with international agreements to support the commitments of the 
        United States to ensure the physical security and protection of 
        Camp Liberty/Hurriya residents, members of the opposition 
        Mujahedeen e-Khalq (MEK), in accordance with the United States 
        Embassy Statement on Transfer of Security Responsibility for 
        Camp Ashraf of December 28, 2008;
            (2) assist the United Nations High Commissioner for 
        Refugees in ensuring the rapid and orderly resettlement of all 
        residents of Camp Liberty/Hurriya to safe locations outside of 
        Iraq; and
            (3) permit the admission as refugees of the residents of 
        Camp Liberty/Hurriya to the United States, who express a desire 
        for such resettlement.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States recognized the residents of the 
        former Camp Ashraf who now reside in Camp Liberty/Hurriya as 
        ``protected persons'' under the Fourth Geneva Convention and 
        committed itself to protect the residents until their final 
        disposition.
            (2) The United States expects the Government of Iraq to 
        continue this commitment of protection of the residents of Camp 
        Liberty/Hurriya, as reflected in the United States Embassy 
        Statement on Transfer of Security Responsibility for Camp 
        Ashraf of December 28, 2008.
            (3) The residents of the former Camp Ashraf, who now reside 
        in Camp Liberty/Hurriya, renounced violence and unilaterally 
        disarmed more than a decade ago.
            (4) Dozens of residents of Camp Liberty/Hurriya were 
        permanent residents or political refugees in the United States.
            (5) Camp Liberty/Hurriya residents have provided valuable 
        intelligence to the international community concerning efforts 
        by the Government of Iran to establish a nuclear weapons 
        capability and to supply the terrorist groups in Iraq with 
        Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).
            (6) Camp Liberty/Hurriya residents share the desire of the 
        United States in seeing the establishment of a peaceful, 
        democratic, non-nuclear government in Iran with full rights for 
        women and religious and ethnic minorities.
            (7) The residents of Camp Liberty/Hurriya are cooperating 
        in the framework of an agreement between the United Nations and 
        the Government of Iraq to transfer the residents out of Iraq.
            (8) Despite Iraq's acceptance of the U.S. commitment to 
        protect Camp Ashraf residents, the unarmed residents have been 
        attacked five times in 2009, 2011, and 2013 during their 
        residence in the former Camp Ashraf and Camp Liberty/Hurriya by 
        external persons and organizations, including Iraqi security 
        forces, killing more than 100 residents and wounding 1,000 
        others.
            (9) Iraqi security forces are permanently stationed all 
        around Camp Liberty/Hurriya, despite their history of violence 
        against the unarmed residents, while all Liberty/Hurriya 
        residents are kept inside the Camp's walled compound, with no 
        freedom of movement for the residents outside the Camp and no 
        access to counsel, family, NGOs, and press.

SEC. 3. ACTIONS TO PROTECT IRANIAN DISSIDENTS LIVING IN CAMP LIBERTY/
              HURRIYA.

            (1) The United States shall take all necessary and 
        appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the residents of Camp 
        Liberty/Hurriya.
            (2) The United States shall provide all necessary and 
        appropriate assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner 
        for Refugees to process applications by the residents of Camp 
        Liberty/Hurriya for refugee status and to secure their orderly 
        resettlement in safe locations outside of Iraq, including in 
        the United States for any such residents who express such a 
        desire.
            (3) The United States shall timely admit as refugees the 
        residents of Camp Liberty/Hurriya in the U.S. and in doing so 
        shall not delay or bar such resettlement merely because any 
        such resident is or has been a member of, or supports or has 
        supported, organizations or groups that were subject to the 
        Secretary of State's decision of September 21, 2012, in Public 
        Notice 8049, notwithstanding Sec. Sec. 212(a)(3)(B) and 
        212(a)(3)(F) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, as 
        amended.
            (4) Within 90 days of the effective date of this Act, the 
        Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Department of 
        Homeland Security shall report to the Congress on steps taken 
        by the United States to guard the safety of the residents of 
        Camp Liberty/Hurriya and to secure their orderly resettlement 
        in safe locations in accordance with the provisions of this 
        Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
