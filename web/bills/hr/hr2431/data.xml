  <summary>3/6/2014--Public Law.
National Integrated Drought Information System Reauthorization Act of 2014 - Amends the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 to specify that the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Program's purpose shall be to better inform and provide for more timely decisionmaking to reduce drought related impacts and costs.

Revises NIDIS functions to require the NIDIS, among other things, to: (1) provide an effective drought early warning system consisting of certain information, forecasts, and assessments on both national and regional levels; (2) build upon existing forecasting and assessment programs and partnerships through designation of one or more cooperative institutes to assist with NIDIS functions; and (3) continue ongoing research and monitoring activities related to drought and the role of extreme weather events and climate variability in drought.

Requires the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere (who is also the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA]) to report to Congress on the NIDIS Program.

Reauthorizes NIDIS through FY2018.</summary>
