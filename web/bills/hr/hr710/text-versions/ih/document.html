introduce evidence demonstrating that the marijuana-related activities

guilty of an offense only corresponding to the amount of marijuana 
determined to be for nonmedical purposes.

proceeding to which this section applies, with respect to which a 
person successfully makes a defense under this section, shall be

defense is valid, minus such material necessarily destroyed for testing 
purposes.
    ``(d) Any marijuana seized under any Federal law shall be retained 
and not destroyed pending resolution of any forfeiture claim, if not 
later than 30 days after seizure the owner of the property notifies the 
Attorney General, or a duly authorized agent of the Attorney General, 
that a person with an ownership interest in the property is asserting 
an affirmative defense for the medical use of marijuana.
    ``(e) No plant may be seized under any Federal law otherwise 
permitting such seizure if the plant is being grown or stored pursuant 
to a recommendation by a physician or an order of a State or municipal 
agency in accordance with State law regarding the medical use of 
marijuana.
