 Ms. Ros-Lehtinen (for herself, Mr. Perry, Mr. Yoho, and Mr. DeSantis)

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To promote transparency, accountability, and reform within the United 
         Nations Human Rights Council, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United Nations Human Rights Council 
Accountability Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since its establishment in 2006, the United Nations 
        Human Rights Council has failed to meaningfully promote the 
        protection of internationally recognized human rights.
            (2) The United Nations Human Rights Council suffers from 
        fundamental and severe structural flaws since it draws its 
        members from the United Nations General Assembly without any 
        substantive membership criteria, with the perverse result that 
        a number of the world's worst human rights abusers are members 
        of the council.
            (3) For example, more than half of the members of the 
        United Nations Human Rights Council are rated ``Not Free'' or 
        only ``Partly Free'' by Freedom House in its 2014 Freedom in 
        the World report. Only a minority of members were rated 
        ``Free''.
            (4) Current membership on the United Nations Human Rights 
        Council includes some of the world's worst violators, including 
        China, Congo, Cuba, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, 
        Venezuela, Vietnam, and others.
            (5) The United Nations Human Rights Council's agenda 
        contains a permanent item for criticism of the democratic, 
        Jewish State of Israel, but no permanent items criticizing any 
        other state or non-state actor.
            (6) Since 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council has 
        a largely disproportionate number of resolutions focused on 
        criticizing Israel.
            (7) Since 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council has 
        held 22 special sessions to address dire and critical 
        humanitarian crises throughout the world, with 7 focused on 
        criticizing Israel, more than any other two nations combined, 
        despite the fact that the United Nations currently has declared 
        four of the world's humanitarian crises (Syria, Iraq, South 
        Sudan and the Central African Republic) a ``Level 3'', its 
        highest designation.
            (8) On July 23, 2014, the United Nations Human Rights 
        Council adopted a resolution to investigate purported 
        violations of international humanitarian and human rights laws 
        in Gaza and the West Bank. The resolution contained over 1,700 
        words criticizing Israel for supposed human rights violations 
        in Gaza, yet does not mention Hamas, the designated foreign 
        terrorist organization responsible for using Palestinian 
        children, women, and men as human shields and launching 
        thousands of rockets indiscriminately into Israeli civilian 
        populations, even once.
            (9) The July 23, 2014, resolution passed with 29 votes in 
        favor, 17 abstentions and the United States as the lone 
        dissenting vote.
            (10) On August 11, 2014, the United Nations named Professor 
        William Schabas to lead a panel of inquiry in accordance to the 
        July 23, 2014, resolution.
            (11) Schabas has made public statements in the past that 
        should have precluded him from heading the panel as an unbiased 
        participant, and should recuse himself. Among his incendiary 
        and biased remarks, Schabas has stated ``Actually, my favourite 
        would be Netanyahu within the dock of the International 
        Criminal Court,'' in 2012, indicating a clear conflict of 
        interests and lack of impartiality.
            (12) In 2006, the George W. Bush Administration voted 
        against the resolution that created the United Nations Human 
        Rights Council in the United Nations General Assembly over 
        concerns about the Council's reforms and its ability to 
        advocate for human rights and decided to not seek a seat on the 
        Council.
            (13) In June 2008, citing its skepticism regarding the 
        function of the United Nations Human Rights Council in terms of 
        fulfilling its mandate and its imbalanced approach and Israel 
        bashing agenda, the Bush Administration announced it would 
        limit its engagement with the Council.
            (14) In 2008, the Bush Administration announced it would 
        withhold United States funding to the United Nations regular 
        budget equivalent to the United States share of the United 
        Nations Human Rights Council budget.
            (15) In March 2009, reversing the previous Administration's 
        policy, the Obama Administration announced that the United 
        States would run for a seat on the United Nations Human Rights 
        Council, and won a seat in May 2009.
            (16) United States membership in the United Nations Human 
        Rights Council has not led to reform of its fundamental flaws 
        nor diminished the Council's virulently anti-Israel behavior. 
        The Council has passed over two dozen resolutions criticizing 
        Israel since the United States joined in 2009, and the world's 
        worst violators continue to get a pass.
