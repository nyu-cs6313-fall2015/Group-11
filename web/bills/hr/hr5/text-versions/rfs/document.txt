SEC. 7. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Elementary and Secondary Education Act prohibits 
        the Federal Government from mandating, directing, or 
        controlling a State, local educational agency, or school's 
        curriculum, program of instruction, or allocation of State and 
        local resources, and from mandating a State or any subdivision 
        thereof to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for 
        under such Act.
            (2) The Elementary and Secondary Education Act prohibits 
        the Federal Government from funding the development, pilot 
        testing, field testing, implementation, administration, or 
        distribution of any federally sponsored national test in 
        reading, mathematics, or any other subject, unless specifically 
        and explicitly authorized by law.
            (3) The Secretary of Education, through 3 separate 
        initiatives, has created a system of waivers and grants that 
        influence, incentivize, and coerce State educational agencies 
        into implementing common national elementary and secondary 
        standards and assessments endorsed by the Secretary.
            (4) The Race to the Top Fund encouraged and incentivized 
        States to adopt Common Core State Standards developed by the 
        National Governor's Association Center for Best Practices and 
        the Council of Chief State School Officers.
            (5) The Race to the Top Assessment grants awarded to the 
        Partnership for the Assessment of Readiness for College and 
        Careers (PARCC) and SMARTER Balanced Assessment Consortium 
        (SMARTER Balance) initiated the development of Common Core 
        State Standards aligned assessments that will, in turn, inform 
        and ultimately influence kindergarten through 12th-grade 
        curriculum and instructional materials.
            (6) The conditional Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
        flexibility waiver authority employed by the Department of 
        Education coerced States into accepting Common Core State 
        Standards and aligned assessments.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
States and local educational agencies should maintain the rights and 
responsibilities of determining educational curriculum, programs of 
instruction, and assessments for elementary and secondary education.

agencies in the State based on the number of eligible children enrolled 
in the public schools served by each local educational agency.

        child' means a child aged 5 to 17, inclusive, from a family 
        with an income below the poverty level on the basis of the most 
        recent satisfactory data published by the Department of

        with incomes below the poverty level for the purposes of this 
        section, a State educational agency shall use the criteria of 
        poverty used by the Census Bureau in compiling the most recent 
        decennial census, as the criteria have been updated by 
        increases in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers,

        States, not be penalized in any manner by disparities among the 
        States in curriculum, graduation requirements, and State 
        academic standards.
            ``(3) To help such children succeed in school, meet the 
        State academic standards that all children are expected to 
        meet, and graduate from high school prepared for postsecondary 
        education and the workforce without the need for remediation.

fiscal years 2014 through 2016, no State shall receive less than 90 
percent of the State's allocation under this section for the previous

        in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is of the lowest average

                year is insufficient to pay in full the amounts for

        such State's allocation, may submit a consortium arrangement to 
        the Secretary for approval.

determine the identified number of migratory children residing in each 
State for purposes of this section, the Secretary shall--

        reflects the actual number of migratory children;

        accuracy of such information;

        children who reside in each State to take into account--

                participating in evidence-based or other effective 
                special programs provided under this subpart that

        formula so as to better direct services to migratory children, 
        including the most at-risk migratory children.
    ``(g) Nonparticipating States.--In the case of a State desiring to 
receive an allocation under this subpart for a fiscal year that did not 
receive an allocation for the previous fiscal year or that has been 
participating for less than 3 consecutive years, the Secretary shall 
calculate the State's number of identified migratory children aged 3 
through 21 for purposes of subsection (a)(1)(A) by using the most 
recent data available that identifies the migratory children residing 
in the State until data is available to calculate the 3-year average 
number of such children in accordance with such subsection.

``SEC. 6201. SHORT TITLE.

    ``This part may be cited as the `Alaska Native Educational Equity, 
Support, and Assistance Act'.

``SEC. 6202. FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds and declares the following:
            ``(1) The preservation of culture and language is critical 
        to the attainment of educational success, to the betterment of 
        the conditions, and to the long-term well-being, of Alaska 
        Natives. Alaska Native students must be afforded a culturally 
        relevant education.
            ``(2) It is the policy of the Federal Government to 
        maximize the leadership of and participation by Alaska Natives 
        in the planning and the management of Alaska Native education 
        programs and to support efforts developed by and undertaken 
        within the Alaska Native community to improve educational 
        opportunity for all students.
            ``(3) Many Alaska Native children enter and exit school 
        with serious educational disadvantages.
            ``(4) Overcoming the magnitude of the geographic 
        challenges, historical inequities, and other barriers to 
        successfully improving educational outcomes for Alaska Native 
        students in rural, village, and urban settings is challenging. 
        Significant disparities between academic achievement of Alaska 
        Native students and non-Native students continues, including 
        lower graduation rates, increased school dropout rates, and 
        lower achievement scores on standardized tests.
            ``(5) The preservation of Alaska Native cultures and 
        languages and the integration of Alaska Native cultures and 
        languages into education, positive identity development for 
        Alaska Native students, and local, place-based, and culture-

                  TITLE VIII--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

SEC. 801. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) To avoid negative attention and litigation, some local 
        educational agencies have entered into agreements with 
        employees who are suspected of abusing or are known to have 
        abused students.
            (2) Instead of reporting sexual misconduct with minors to 
        the proper authorities such as the police or child welfare 
        services, under such agreements the local educational agencies, 
        schools, and employees keep the information private and 
        facilitate the employee's transfer to another local educational 
        agency.
    (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) confidentiality agreements between local educational 
        agencies or schools and suspected child sex abusers should be 
        prohibited;
            (2) the practice of employee transfers after suspected or 
        proven sexual misconduct should be stopped, and States should 
        require local educational agencies and schools to provide law 
        enforcement with all information regarding sexual conduct 
        between an employee and a minor; and
            (3) Congress should help protect children and help stop 
        this unacceptable practice in our schools.

            Passed the House of Representatives July 19, 2013.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.
