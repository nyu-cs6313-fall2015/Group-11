                                 A BILL


 
   To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for a 
 limitation under the Medicare program on charges for contract health 
  services provided to Indians by Medicare providers of services and 
                               suppliers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Native Contract and Rate Expenditure 
Act of 2014'' or the ``Native CARE Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Federal health services to maintain and improve the 
        health of American Indians and Alaska Natives are consonant 
        with and required by the Federal Government's historical and 
        unique legal relationship with, and resulting trust 
        responsibility to, the American Indian and Alaska Native 
        people.
            (2) The unmet health needs of American Indians and Alaska 
        Natives are severe and the health status of American Indians 
        and Alaska Natives is far below that of the general population 
        of the United States, resulting in an average life expectancy 
        for American Indians and Alaska Natives 4.2 years less than 
        that for the all races population of the United States.
            (3) The Indian Health Service and tribal Purchased/Referred 
        Care programs purchase primary and specialty care services from 
        private health care providers when those services are not 
        available at Indian Health Service or Tribal health facilities.
            (4) Available Purchased/Referred Care funds have been 
        insufficient to ensure access to care for American Indians and 
        Alaska Natives, resulting in rationed care and diagnosis and 
        treatment delays that lead to the need for more intensive and 
        expensive treatment, further reducing already scarce Purchased/
        Referred Care funds.
            (5) In 2003, Congress amended title XVIII of the Social 
        Security Act to require Medicare-participating hospitals to 
        accept patients referred from the Indian Health Service and 
        Tribal Purchased/Referred Care programs and to accept payment 
        at no more than Medicare rates--the Medicare-like rate cap--for 
        the services provided.
            (6) The Medicare-like rate cap only applies to hospital 
        services, and does not apply to other types of Medicare-
        participating providers and suppliers.
            (7) Unlike other Federal health care programs, the Indian 
        Health Service and Tribal Purchased/Referred Care programs 
        continue to pay full billed charges for non-hospital services.
            (8) Because Purchased/Referred programs continue to pay 
        full billed charges for non-hospital services, in many cases 
        the Indian Health Service may only treat the most desperate 
        ``Life'' or ``Limb'' cases, leading to many undesirable health 
        outcomes for American Indians and Alaska Natives, and 
        ultimately increasing costs to the Purchased/Referred Care 
        programs.
            (9) On April 11, 2013, the Government Accountability Office 
        released a report finding that capping Purchased/Referred Care 
        reimbursement at Medicare-like rates for nonhospital services 
        would enable the Indian Health Service to double the number of 
        physician services provided by adding an additional 253,000 
        patient visits annually.

SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CHARGES FOR CERTAIN CONTRACT HEALTH SERVICES
