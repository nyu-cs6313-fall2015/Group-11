\n information regarding the borrower's anticipated (in the case of a first-time borrower) or outstanding balance and anticipated monthly payment amount under at least the standard repayment plan and the income-based repayment plan; \n information regarding the borrower's obligation to repay the full amount of the loan, regardless of the progress the borrower makes in completing the borrower's program of study; \n information regarding the likely consequences of defaulting on the loan and specified information regarding the IHE's cohort default rate; \n information on the National Student Loan Data system and how the borrower can access the borrower's records; and \n contact information for the IHE's financial aid office or other office the borrower may contact to ask questions concerning the loan. \n \n Requires the annual counseling provided to a borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan made on behalf of a dependent student to include:\n\ninformation regarding the effect of accepting the loan on the borrower's eligibility for other forms of student aid; \n an explanation of the use of the master promissory note; \n an explanation that the borrower is not required to accept the full amount of the loan; \n information regarding the borrower's obligation to repay the full amount of the loan, regardless of the progress the student makes in completing the student's program of study;

(2) use the online annual counseling tool to notify a borrower who receives annual Direct Loan counseling through such tool regarding when the borrower should accept such loan; and (3) attempt to use the online exit counseling tool to provide exit counseling to a student who leaves an IHE without the prior knowledge of the IHE, provided the IHE provides exit counseling using such tool.\n\n(Sec. 5) Directs the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Institute of Education Sciences, to conduct a rigorous, longitudinal study of the impact and effectiveness of the student loan counseling required under title IV or provided through such other means the Secretary requires.\n\nRequires the study to include borrower information(in the aggregate and disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, income, and status as an individual with a disability) on:\n\n student persistence;
