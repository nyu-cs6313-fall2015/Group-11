  <summary>12/9/2014--Introduced.
Innovate America Act - Directs the Secretary of Education, in coordination with the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF), to award grants, on a competitive basis, to state educational agencies to establish or expand the number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including computer science (STEM) secondary schools in the United States from approximately 100 to approximately 200.

Requires the Secretary, in coordination with the NSF Director, to:

 develop a database identifying existing STEM secondary schools, and study how to improve retention rates of students in STEM programs at institutions of higher education. Directs the President to ensure that at least 15% of all federal funds available each fiscal year for undergraduate research opportunities at 2-year and 4-year degree granting institutions of higher education are used to fund research opportunities for postsecondary students.

Requires the NSF Director to administer a Technology Commercialization Awards Pilot Program through which promising technology advances derived from NSF research grants shall be eligible for funding.

Amends the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2002 to extend the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program to cover specifically informatics and computer science.

Directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a manufacturing assistance program for small and medium-sized domestic manufacturers to promote the manufacturing of goods in the United States and enable them to be competitive in global markets.

Requires the Under Secretary for International Trade of the Department of Commerce to report to Congress on the global competitiveness of 20 U.S. industries that export the most goods or services and the domestic and foreign regulatory and policy barriers to increasing their exports.

Requires: (1) the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), beginning in FY2015, to devise a strategy to reduce overall government printing costs over a 10-year period; and (2) each federal department and agency to issue guidance on the appropriate use of award and incentive fees in their programs.

Requires return to the Treasury of any funds intended to be awarded as incentive fees to contractors that are not paid owing to contractor inability to meet established criteria in this Act.</summary>
