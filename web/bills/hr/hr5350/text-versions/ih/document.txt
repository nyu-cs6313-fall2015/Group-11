        products made from such alloys, may be marketed, distributed, 
        or sold with labeling making claims regarding the microbial 
        reduction or infection control efficacy of the alloys if the 
        claims are consistent with the results of--
                    ``(A) federally-funded clinical trials finding 
                greater than 25 percent reductions in infection rate or 
                50 percent reductions in microbial burden; or
                    ``(B) federally-funded clinical trials finding
