			 investment in higher education, in order to strengthen the economy of the
			 United States by improving opportunities for low-income students to
			 complete higher education and join the middle class.</text>

			<paragraph id="HFCFB4CDD9D484E17B079A7E00879DD5F"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Federal Pell Grants provided under section 401 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.
			 1070a) (referred to in this Act as <quote>Federal Pell Grants</quote>) have historically been the fundamental Federal investment in helping low-income students pay for
			 college and enter the middle class. In the 1979–1980 academic year, the
			 maximum Federal Pell Grant paid for 77 percent of the average cost of
			 attendance at an in-State, 4-year institution of higher education.
			 However, in the 2012–2013 academic year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant
			 covered only about 30 percent of that average cost of attendance.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H0BFD128729234E0C9E0493FF06C06EE0"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The program providing Federal Pell Grants already acts as a quasi-entitlement, in which both
			 mandatory funding and discretionary funding combine to maintain a maximum
			 Federal Pell Grant amount.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H7E839F5302034A7992994A51CE0DD1DF"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Congressional Budget Office reports on any overall financial surplus or shortfall in the
			 funding provided for the Federal Pell Grant program. However, in recent
			 years, in order to meet the maximum Federal Pell Grant level with the
			 provided level of funding, Congress has made cuts to the program through
			 imposing additional eligibility requirements for Federal Pell Grants and
			 limiting the availability of year-round Federal Pell Grants, causing
			 significant uncertainty and reducing access to higher education for
			 millions of hardworking college students.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HDEE02667D15B4B05A1E153976D7D654C"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Removing the Federal Pell Grant program from the uncertainty of the congressional discretionary
			 appropriations process will improve student access to, and the
			 affordability of, higher education.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H7C439B67959C494FB2949FB53AE40F1F"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The <quote>traditional student</quote> who attends college for 4 years immediately after high school is now a minority of college
			 students today. Ambitious students now need more flexibility to attend
			 school year-round while juggling work schedules.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H1BBFC24B76184DC5BECD991DBB71C055"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Section 1860 of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public
			 Law 112–10, 125 Stat. 169) eliminated the provision of the Federal Pell
			 Grant program of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a et
			 seq.) that allowed 2 Federal Pell Grant awards per year, creating
			 significant hardship for many students trying to take courses over the
			 summer or outside the traditional school calendar. Allowing students to
			 continue to receive Federal Pell Grants in successive semesters, without a
			 gap, would reduce the time needed to complete their degrees.</text>
