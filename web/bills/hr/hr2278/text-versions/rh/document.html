Act (8 U.S.C. 1229c) is amended--

        under this subsection instead of being subject to proceedings 
        under section 240.'';

                (3);
                    (D) by adding after paragraph (1) the following:
            ``(2) Before the conclusion of removal proceedings.--If an 
        alien is not described in paragraph (2)(A)(iii) or (4) of 
        section 237(a), the Attorney General may permit the alien to 
        voluntarily depart the United States at the alien's own expense 
        under this subsection after the initiation of removal 
        proceedings under section 240 and before the conclusion of such 
        proceedings before an immigration judge.'';
                    (E) in paragraph (3), as redesignated--
                            (i) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as 
                        follows:
                    ``(A) Instead of removal.--Subject to subparagraph

                days. The Secretary may require an alien permitted to 
                voluntarily depart under paragraph (1) to post a 
                voluntary departure bond, to be surrendered upon proof 
                that the alien has departed the United States within

                paragraph (2) shall not be valid for any period in 
                excess of 60 days, and may be granted only after a 
                finding that the alien has the means to depart the 
                United States and intends to do so. An alien permitted 
                to voluntarily depart under paragraph (2) shall post a 
                voluntary departure bond, in an amount necessary to 
                ensure that the alien will depart, to be surrendered 
                upon proof that the alien has departed the United 
                States within the time specified. An immigration judge 
                may waive the requirement to post a voluntary departure 
                bond in individual cases upon a finding that the alien 
                has presented compelling evidence that the posting of a 
                bond will pose a serious financial hardship and the 
                alien has presented credible evidence that such a bond 
                is unnecessary to guarantee timely departure.'';

            (3) by amending subsection (c) to read as follows:
    ``(c) Conditions on Voluntary Departure.--
            ``(1) Voluntary departure agreement.--Voluntary departure 
        may only be granted as part of an affirmative agreement by the 
        alien. A voluntary departure agreement under subsection (b) 
        shall include a waiver of the right to any further motion, 
        appeal, application, petition, or petition for review relating 
        to removal or relief or protection from removal.
            ``(2) Concessions by the secretary.--In connection with the 
        alien's agreement to depart voluntarily under paragraph (1), 
        the Secretary of Homeland Security may agree to a reduction in 
        the period of inadmissibility under subparagraph (A) or (B)(i) 
        of section 212(a)(9).
            ``(3) Advisals.--Agreements relating to voluntary departure 
        granted during removal proceedings under section 240, or at the 
        conclusion of such proceedings, shall be presented on the 
        record before the immigration judge. The immigration judge 
        shall advise the alien of the consequences of a voluntary 
        departure agreement before accepting such agreement.
            ``(4) Failure to comply with agreement.--
                    ``(A) In general.--If an alien agrees to voluntary 
                departure under this section and fails to depart the 
                United States within the time allowed for voluntary 
                departure or fails to comply with any other terms of 
                the agreement (including failure to timely post any 
                required bond), the alien is--
                            ``(i) ineligible for the benefits of the 
                        agreement;

                timely appeal of the immigration judge's decision 
                granting voluntary departure, the alien may pursue the 
                appeal instead of the voluntary departure agreement. 
                Such appeal operates to void the alien's voluntary 
                departure agreement and the consequences of such 
                agreement, but precludes the alien from another grant 
                of voluntary departure while the alien remains in the 
                United States.
            ``(5) Voluntary departure period not affected.--Except as 
        expressly agreed to by the Secretary in writing in the exercise

        period allowed for voluntary departure, no motion, appeal, 
        application, petition, or petition for review shall affect, 
        reinstate, enjoin, delay, stay, or toll the alien's obligation 
        to depart from the United States during the period agreed to by 
        the alien and the Secretary.'';

voluntarily depart under this section and fails to voluntarily depart 
from the United States within the time period specified or otherwise 
violates the terms of a voluntary departure agreement, the alien will 
be subject to the following penalties:
            ``(1) Civil penalty.--The alien shall be liable for a civil 
        penalty of $3,000. The order allowing voluntary departure shall 
        specify this amount, which shall be acknowledged by the alien 
        on the record. If the Secretary thereafter establishes that the 
        alien failed to depart voluntarily within the time allowed, no 
        further procedure will be necessary to establish the amount of 
        the penalty, and the Secretary may collect the civil penalty at 
        any time thereafter and by whatever means provided by law. An 
        alien will be ineligible for any benefits under this chapter 
        until this civil penalty is paid.
            ``(2) Ineligibility for relief.--The alien shall be 
        ineligible during the time the alien remains in the United 
        States and for a period of 10 years after the alien's departure 
        for any further relief under this section and sections 240A, 
        245, 248, and 249. The order permitting the alien to depart 
        voluntarily shall inform the alien of the penalties under this

        failure to depart, or upon the alien's other violations of the 
        conditions for voluntary departure, during the period described 
        in paragraph (2). This paragraph does not preclude a motion to 
        reopen to seek withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) 
        or protection against torture, if the motion--

                voluntary departure in the country to which the alien 
                would be removed; and

        not be permitted to voluntarily depart under this section if 
        the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General 
        previously permitted the alien to depart voluntarily.

        to limit eligibility or impose additional conditions for 
        voluntary departure under subsection (a)(1) for any class of 
        aliens. The Secretary or Attorney General may by regulation 
        limit eligibility or impose additional conditions for voluntary 
        departure under subsections (a)(2) or (b) of this section for 
        any class or classes of aliens.''; and
            (6) in subsection (f), by adding at the end the following:

        1361, 1651, and 2241 of title 28, United States Code, any other 
        habeas corpus provision, and any other provision of law
