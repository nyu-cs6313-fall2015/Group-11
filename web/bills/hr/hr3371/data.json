Ford Federal Direct Loan Program) of title IV; placing such loans on their preferred list only if the loans' terms and conditions are at least as favorable as the terms and conditions on Direct loans; and prominently disclosing to borrowers the methods and criteria it used in deciding to recommend, promote, or endorse such loans."
