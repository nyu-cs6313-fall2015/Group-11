 To require the payment of the full amount of separation pay otherwise

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Military Separation Pay Fairness Act 
of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FULL SEPARATION PAY FOR FORMER MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO 
              WERE SEPARATED UNDER FORMER DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL POLICY.

    (a) Identification of Affected Members.--Not later than 60 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
shall--
            (1) identify each former member of the Armed Forces who was 
        separated from the Armed Forces for violation of the policy 
        expressed in subsection (b) of section 654 of title 10, United 
        States Code, as in effect before the effective date of the 
        Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-321; 
        124 Stat. 3516); and
            (2) determine, for each member so identified, whether the 
        member was paid the full amount of the separation pay to which 
        the member should have been entitled under section 1174 of such 
        title or was paid a reduced amount of separation pay because of 
        homosexuality, pursuant to paragraph 3.2.3.1.4 of Department of 
        Defense Instruction No. 1332.29, as in effect at the time of 
        the separation of the member.

the full amount of the separation pay to which the member should have 
been entitled under section 1174 of title 10, United States Code, the 
Secretary shall pay to the member (or to the estate of the member if 
the member is deceased) an amount equal to--
            (1) the amount of the difference between the full amount of 
        the separation pay that the member should have been paid under 
        such section and the amount of separation pay actually paid to 
        the member; and
            (2) interest on the amount determined under paragraph (1) 
        as provided in section 1035(b) of such title.

subsection (b)(2).
    (d) Source of Funds for Payments.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
make the payments required by subsection (b) using amounts appropriated 
for the payment of separation pay to members of the Armed Forces under 
section 1174 of title 10, United States Code.
