Excludes a resolution or settlement that includes no more than: (1) the right to market the generic drug before the expiration of the patent or other exclusivity period, or (2) the waiver of a patent infringement claim for damages.\n\nAuthorizes the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to exempt agreements in furtherance of market competition and for the benefit of consumers.\n\nAmends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem an applicant to have forfeited market exclusivity if the applicant enters into an agreement that violates this Act.\n\nAmends the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 to revise reporting requirements related to agreements between a generic drug applicant and a brand name drug company to include: (1) a description of the subject matter of other agreements between the parties; and (2) a certification that the materials filed represent the complete, final, and exclusive agreement between the parties."
