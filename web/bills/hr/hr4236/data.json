Ford Federal Direct Loan (DL) programs receives a prepayment for such loans, it is to be applied first toward any fees due on such loans and then, unless the borrower requests otherwise, toward the principal due on the loan that bears the highest interest rate.\n\nMakes that requirement inapplicable to income-based or income contingent repayment plans for FFELs or DLs.\n\nRequires an institution of higher education holding a borrower's loans under the Federal Perkins Loan program to first apply any excess payments by the borrower toward any fees due on such loans and then, unless the borrower requests otherwise, toward the principal due on the loan that bears the highest interest rate.\n\nAmends the Truth in Lending Act to require a private education loan holder that holds more than one private education loan for a borrower to apply any prepayments on those loans first toward any fees due on such loans and then, unless the borrower requests otherwise, toward the principal due on the loan that bears the highest interest rate."
