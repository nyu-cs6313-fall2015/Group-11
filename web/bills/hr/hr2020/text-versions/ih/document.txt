(20 U.S.C. 1094(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph:
            ``(30)(A) The institution will provide to each student 
        admitted to an undergraduate or graduate program--
                    ``(i) a multi-year tuition and fee schedule; or
                    ``(ii) a single-year tuition and fee schedule, and 
                a nonbinding, multi-year estimate of net costs after 
                all financial aid is awarded, assuming constant family 
                and student income, assets, and relevant circumstances.
            ``(B) Multi-year schedules and estimates required by 
        subparagraph (A)--
                    ``(i) may include a percentage or dollar increase 
                or decrease of any size the institution determines to 
                be appropriate from one year to the next; and
                    ``(ii) shall indicate, on a year-by-year basis, 
                costs for the normal duration of such student's 
                undergraduate or graduate program.
            ``(C) Institutions that elect a single-year tuition and fee 
        schedule under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall include with each 
        multi-year estimate provided under such subparagraph the 
        average deviation, in percentage terms, between previous year 
        estimates and actual net costs for students at their 
        institution.
            ``(D) The Secretary shall waive the requirements of 
        subparagraph (A) if the institution demonstrates to the 
        Secretary that the requirements of subparagraph (A) are not 
        practicable because of the occurrence of one or more events 
        causing the institution severe economic distress, dramatic 
        reduction of State or Federal aid, or any other circumstance 
        determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall be
