  <summary>12/3/2013--Introduced.
Update, Promote, and Develop America's Transportation Essentials Act of 2013 - Expresses the sense of Congress that by 2024,&#160;the gas tax should be repealed and replaced with a more sustainable, stable funding source.

Amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the excise tax on motor fuels, to increase the rate of tax on: (1) gasoline other than aviation gasoline to 33.3 cents per gallon after 2015 and before 2025, (2) diesel fuel or kerosene to 39.3 cents per gallon after 2015 and before 2025, and (3) diesel-water fuel emulsion. Delays the termination of such increased rates from the end of FY2016 to December 31, 2024.

Imposes a floor stocks tax on&#160;rate increases for gasoline, diesel fuel, and&#160; kerosene (other than aviation-grade kerosene), subject to specified exemptions for exempt uses and low-volume producers.</summary>
