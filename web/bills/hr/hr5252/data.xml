  <summary>7/29/2014--Introduced.
Tax and Fee Collection Fairness Act of 2014 - Prohibits a state from requiring any person&#160;to&#160;collect from, or remit on behalf of, any other person any state or local fee, tax, or surcharge imposed on a purchaser or user with respect to the purchase or use of any product or service within a state, unless there is transactional nexus between the person from whom the state seeks to require such collection or remittance and the purchaser or user of such product or service. Defines "transactional nexus" as a direct monetary transaction between the person required to collect or remit the fee, tax, or surcharge and the purchaser or user upon whom the fee, tax, or surcharge is imposed.</summary>
