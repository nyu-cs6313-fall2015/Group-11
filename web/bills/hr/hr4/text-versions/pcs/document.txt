    Section 201 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C.

``SEC. 201. REGULATORY PROCESS AND PRINCIPLES.

    ``(a) In General.--Each agency shall, unless otherwise expressly 
prohibited by law, assess the effects of Federal regulatory actions on 
State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector (other than 
to the extent that such regulatory actions incorporate requirements 
specifically set forth in law) in accordance with the following 
principles:
            ``(1) Each agency shall identify the problem that it 
        intends to address (including, if applicable, the failures of 
        private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency 
        action) as well as assess the significance of that problem.
            ``(2) Each agency shall examine whether existing 
        regulations (or other law) have created, or contributed to, the 
        problem that a new regulation is intended to correct and 
        whether those regulations (or other law) should be modified to 
        achieve the intended goal of regulation more effectively.
            ``(3) Each agency shall identify and assess available 
        alternatives to direct regulation, including providing economic 
        incentives to encourage the desired behavior, such as user fees 
        or marketable permits, or providing information upon which 
        choices can be made by the public.
            ``(4) If an agency determines that a regulation is the best 
        available method of achieving the regulatory objective, it 
        shall design its regulations in the most cost-effective manner 
        to achieve the regulatory objective. In doing so, each agency 
        shall consider incentives for innovation, consistency, 
        predictability, the costs of enforcement and compliance (to the 
        government, regulated entities, and the public), flexibility, 
        distributive impacts, and equity.
            ``(5) Each agency shall assess both the costs and the 
        benefits of the intended regulation and, recognizing that some 
        costs and benefits are difficult to quantify, propose or adopt 
        a regulation, unless expressly prohibited by law, only upon a 
        reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended 
        regulation justify its costs.
            ``(6) Each agency shall base its decisions on the best 
        reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and 
        other information concerning the need for, and consequences of, 
        the intended regulation.
            ``(7) Each agency shall identify and assess alternative 
        forms of regulation and shall, to the extent feasible, specify 
        performance objectives, rather than specifying the behavior or 
        manner of compliance that regulated entities must adopt.
            ``(8) Each agency shall avoid regulations that are 
        inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative with its other 
        regulations or those of other Federal agencies.
            ``(9) Each agency shall tailor its regulations to minimize 
        the costs of the cumulative impact of regulations.
            ``(10) Each agency shall draft its regulations to be simple 
        and easy to understand, with the goal of minimizing the 
        potential for uncertainty and litigation arising from such 
        uncertainty.
    ``(b) Regulatory Action Defined.--In this section, the term 
`regulatory action' means any substantive action by an agency (normally 
published in the Federal Register) that promulgates or is expected to 
lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including 
advance notices of proposed rulemaking and notices of proposed 
rulemaking.''.

SEC. 109. EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF STATEMENTS TO ACCOMPANY SIGNIFICANT 
              REGULATORY ACTIONS.

    (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1532) is amended to read as

    ``(a) In General.--Unless otherwise expressly prohibited by law, 
before promulgating any general notice of proposed rulemaking or any 
final rule, or within six months after promulgating any final rule that 
was not preceded by a general notice of proposed rulemaking, if the 
proposed rulemaking or final rule includes a Federal mandate that may 
result in an annual effect on State, local, or tribal governments, or 
to the private sector, in the aggregate of $100,000,000 or more in any 
1 year, the agency shall prepare a written statement containing the 
following:
            ``(1) The text of the draft proposed rulemaking or final 
        rule, together with a reasonably detailed description of the 
        need for the proposed rulemaking or final rule and an 
        explanation of how the proposed rulemaking or final rule will 
        meet that need.
            ``(2) An assessment of the potential costs and benefits of 
        the proposed rulemaking or final rule, including an explanation 
        of the manner in which the proposed rulemaking or final rule is 
        consistent with a statutory requirement and avoids undue 
        interference with State, local, and tribal governments in the 
        exercise of their governmental functions.
            ``(3) A qualitative and quantitative assessment, including 
        the underlying analysis, of benefits anticipated from the 
        proposed rulemaking or final rule (such as the promotion of the 
        efficient functioning of the economy and private markets, the 
        enhancement of health and safety, the protection of the natural 
        environment, and the elimination or reduction of discrimination 
        or bias).
            ``(4) A qualitative and quantitative assessment, including 
        the underlying analysis, of costs anticipated from the proposed 
        rulemaking or final rule (such as the direct costs both to the 
        Government in administering the final rule and to businesses 
        and others in complying with the final rule, and any adverse 
        effects on the efficient functioning of the economy, private 
        markets (including productivity, employment, and international 
        competitiveness), health, safety, and the natural environment).
            ``(5) Estimates by the agency, if and to the extent that 
        the agency determines that accurate estimates are reasonably 
        feasible, of--
                    ``(A) the future compliance costs of the Federal 
                mandate; and
                    ``(B) any disproportionate budgetary effects of the 
                Federal mandate upon any particular regions of the 
                Nation or particular State, local, or tribal 
                governments, urban or rural or other types of 
                communities, or particular segments of the private 
                sector.
            ``(6)(A) A detailed description of the extent of the 
        agency's prior consultation with the private sector and elected 
        representatives (under section 204) of the affected State, 
        local, and tribal governments.
            ``(B) A detailed summary of the comments and concerns that 
        were presented by the private sector and State, local, or 
        tribal governments either orally or in writing to the agency.
            ``(C) A detailed summary of the agency's evaluation of 
        those comments and concerns.
            ``(7) A detailed summary of how the agency complied with

                mandates'' and inserting ``Federal mandates''; and

    ``(c) Guidelines.--For appropriate implementation of subsections 
(a) and (b) consistent with applicable laws and regulations, the 
following guidelines shall be followed:
            ``(1) Consultations shall take place as early as possible, 
        before issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking, continue 
        through the final rule stage, and be integrated explicitly into 
        the rulemaking process.
            ``(2) Agencies shall consult with a wide variety of State, 
        local, and tribal officials and impacted parties within the 
        private sector (including small businesses). Geographic, 
        political, and other factors that may differentiate varying 
        points of view should be considered.
            ``(3) Agencies should estimate benefits and costs to assist 
        with these consultations. The scope of the consultation should 
        reflect the cost and significance of the Federal mandate being 
        considered.
            ``(4) Agencies shall, to the extent practicable--
                    ``(A) seek out the views of State, local, and 
                tribal governments, and impacted parties within the 
                private sector (including small business), on costs, 
                benefits, and risks; and
                    ``(B) solicit ideas about alternative methods of 
                compliance and potential flexibilities, and input on 
                whether the Federal regulation will harmonize with and 
                not duplicate similar laws in other levels of 
                government.
            ``(5) Consultations shall address the cumulative impact of 
        regulations on the affected entities.
            ``(6) Agencies may accept electronic submissions of 
        comments by relevant parties but may not use those comments as 
        the sole method of satisfying the guidelines in this 
        subsection.''.

        proposed, including whether a rule making is required by

        the agency can or should propose a rule or undertake other 
        agency action.

        the agency may address with a rule (including the degree and 
        nature of risks the problem poses and the priority of 
        addressing those risks compared to other matters or activities 
        within the agency's jurisdiction), whether the problem warrants 
        new agency action, and the countervailing risks that may be 
        posed by alternatives for new agency action.

        the problem the agency may address with a rule and whether 
        those rules could be amended or rescinded to address the 
        problem in whole or part.

                        alternatives rather than agency actions that

upon which the agency bases the proposed rule fails to comply with the 
Information Quality Act.

days after receipt of the petition, provide a reasonable opportunity 
for cross-examination at the hearing, and decide the issues presented 
by the petition not later than 60 days after receipt of the petition.

such a prima facie case.

    ``(e) Hearings for High-Impact Rules.--Following notice of a 
proposed rule making, receipt of comments on the proposed rule, and any 
hearing held under subsection (d)(4), and before adoption of any high-
impact rule, the agency shall hold a hearing in accordance with 
sections 556 and 557, unless such hearing is waived by all participants 
in the rule making other than the agency. The agency shall provide a 
reasonable opportunity for cross-examination at such hearing. The 
hearing shall be limited to the following issues of fact, except that 
participants at the hearing other than the agency may waive 
determination of any such issue:
            ``(1) Whether the agency's asserted factual predicate for 
        the rule is supported by the evidence.
            ``(2) Whether there is an alternative to the proposed rule 
        that would achieve the relevant statutory objectives at a lower 
        cost (including all costs to be considered under subsection 
        (b)(6)) than the proposed rule.
            ``(3) If there is more than one alternative to the proposed 
        rule that would achieve the relevant statutory objectives at a 
        lower cost than the proposed rule, which alternative would 
        achieve the relevant statutory objectives at the lowest cost.
            ``(4) Whether, if the agency proposes to adopt a rule that 
        is more costly than the least costly alternative that would 
        achieve the relevant statutory objectives (including all costs 
        to be considered under subsection (b)(6)), the additional 
        benefits of the more costly rule exceed the additional costs of 
        the more costly rule.
            ``(5) Whether the evidence and other information upon which 
        the agency bases the proposed rule meets the requirements of 
        the Information Quality Act.
            ``(6) Upon petition by an interested person who has 
        participated in the rule making, other issues relevant to the 
        rule making, unless the agency determines that consideration of 
        the issues at the hearing would not advance consideration of 
        the rule or would, in light of the nature of the need for 
        agency action, unreasonably delay completion of the rule 
        making. An agency shall grant or deny a petition under this 
        paragraph within 30 days of its receipt of the petition.
No later than 45 days before any hearing held under this subsection or 
sections 556 and 557, the agency shall publish in the Federal Register 
a notice specifying the proposed rule to be considered at such hearing, 
the issues to be considered at the hearing, and the time and place for 
such hearing, except that such notice may be issued not later than 15 
days before a hearing held under subsection (d)(4)(B).

following consultation with the Administrator of the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs to facilitate compliance with 
applicable rule making requirements.
    ``(2) The agency shall adopt a rule only on the basis of the best 
reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, and other 
evidence and information concerning the need for, consequences of, and 
alternatives to the rule.
    ``(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the agency shall 
adopt the least costly rule considered during the rule making 
(including all costs to be considered under subsection (b)(6)) that 
meets relevant statutory objectives.
    ``(B) The agency may adopt a rule that is more costly than the 
least costly alternative that would achieve the relevant statutory 
objectives only if the additional benefits of the more costly rule 
justify its additional costs and only if the agency explains its reason 
for doing so based on interests of public health, safety or welfare 
that are clearly within the scope of the statutory provision 
authorizing the rule.
    ``(4) When it adopts a final rule, the agency shall publish a 
notice of final rule making. The notice shall include--
            ``(A) a concise, general statement of the rule's basis and 
        purpose;

        a rule to address the problem the agency seeks to address with

        the rule is in fact achieving statutory objectives, whether the 
        rule's benefits continue to justify its costs, and whether the 
        rule can be modified or rescinded to reduce costs while 
        continuing to achieve statutory objectives; and

adoption of the rule, and, at the discretion of the President or the 
Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,

when notice or hearing is required by statute, the following do not 
apply to interpretive rules, general statements of policy, or rules of 
agency organization, procedure, or practice:

            ``(B) Paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (f).

(and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor 
in the rules issued) that compliance with subsection (c), (d), or (e) 
or requirements to render final determinations under subsection (f) of 
this section before the issuance of an interim rule is impracticable or 
contrary to the public interest, including interests of national 
security, such subsections or requirements to render final 
determinations shall not apply to the agency's adoption of an interim 
rule.
    ``(B) If, following compliance with subparagraph (A) of this 
paragraph, the agency adopts an interim rule, it shall commence 
proceedings that comply fully with subsections (d) through (f) of this 
section immediately upon publication of the interim rule, shall treat 
the publication of the interim rule as publication of a notice of 
proposed rule making and shall not be required to issue supplemental 
notice other than to complete full compliance with subsection (d). No 
less than 270 days from publication of the interim rule (or 18 months 
in the case of a major rule or high-impact rule), the agency shall 
complete rule making under subsections (d) through (f) of this 
subsection and take final action to adopt a final rule or rescind the 
interim rule. If the agency fails to take timely final action, the 
interim rule will cease to have the effect of law.

upon the agency's publication of an interim rule without compliance 
with subsection (c), (d), or (e) or requirements to render final 
determinations under subsection (f) of this section, an interested 
party may seek immediate judicial review under chapter 7 of this title 
of the agency's determination to adopt such interim rule. The record on 
such review shall include all documents and information considered by 
the agency and any additional information presented by a party that the 
court determines necessary to consider to assure justice.
    ``(3) When the agency for good cause finds (and incorporates the 
finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) 
that notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary, including 
because agency rule making is undertaken only to correct a de minimis 
technical or clerical error in a previously issued rule or for other 
noncontroversial purposes, the agency may publish a rule without 
compliance with subsection (c), (d), (e), or (f)(1)-(3) and (f)(4)(B)-
(F). If the agency receives significant adverse comment within 60 days 
after publication of the rule, it shall treat the notice of the rule as 
a notice of proposed rule making and complete rule making in compliance 
with subsections (d) and (f).

required under subsection (e) or is otherwise required by statute or at 
the agency's discretion before adoption of a rule, the agency shall

requirements of subsection (f) in adopting the rule and in providing 
notice of the rule's adoption.

service of a substantive final or interim rule shall be made not less 
than 30 days before the effective date of the rule, except--

        exemption or relieves a restriction;

person the right to petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of 
a rule.

Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs shall establish guidelines 
for the assessment, including quantitative and qualitative assessment, 
of the costs and benefits of proposed and final rules and other 
economic issues or issues related to risk that are relevant to rule 
making under this title. The rigor of cost-benefit analysis required by 
such guidelines shall be commensurate, in the Administrator's 
determination, with the economic impact of the rule.
    ``(B) To ensure that agencies use the best available techniques to 
quantify and evaluate anticipated present and future benefits, costs, 
other economic issues, and risks as accurately as possible, the 
Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs shall 
regularly update guidelines established under paragraph (1)(A) of this 
subsection.
    ``(2) The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs shall also issue guidelines to promote coordination, 
simplification and harmonization of agency rules during the rule making 
process and otherwise. Such guidelines shall assure that each agency 
avoids regulations that are inconsistent or incompatible with, or 
duplicative of, its other regulations and those of other Federal 
agencies and drafts its regulations to be simple and easy to 
understand, with the goal of minimizing the potential for uncertainty 
and litigation arising from such uncertainty.

Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs 
shall--

        that rule makings conducted in whole or in part under 
        procedures specified in provisions of law other than those of 
        subchapter II of this title conform to the fullest extent 
        allowed by law with the procedures set forth in section 553 of

        subsections 553(d)(4) and 553(e) of this section, including to 
        assure a reasonable opportunity for cross-examination. Each 
        agency shall adopt regulations for the conduct of hearings 
        consistent with the guidelines issued under this subparagraph.
    ``(4) The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs shall issue guidelines pursuant to the Information Quality Act 
to apply in rule making proceedings under sections 553, 556, and 557 of 
this title. In all cases, such guidelines, and the Administrator's 
specific determinations regarding agency compliance with such 
guidelines, shall be entitled to judicial deference.
    ``(l) Inclusion in the Record of Certain Documents and 
Information.--The agency shall include in the record for a rule making, 
and shall make available by electronic means and otherwise, all 
documents and information prepared or considered by the agency during 
the proceeding, including, at the discretion of the President or the 
Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 
documents and information communicated by that Office during 
consultation with the Agency.
    ``(m) Monetary Policy Exemption.--Nothing in subsection (b)(6), 
subparagraphs (F) and (G) of subsection (d)(1), subsection (e), 
subsection (f)(3), and subparagraphs (C) and (D) of subsection (f)(5) 
shall apply to rule makings that concern monetary policy proposed or 
implemented by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or 
the Federal Open Market Committee.''.

                their costs and benefits (including all costs to be

        understandable, consistent with relevant statutory and 
        regulatory provisions and requirements or practices of other 
        agencies, does not produce costs that are unjustified by the 
        guidance's benefits, and is otherwise appropriate.

policy issue arising out of statutory mandates, the agency shall

means and otherwise.

incompatible with, or duplicative of, the agency's governing statutes 
or regulations, with the goal of minimizing the potential for 
uncertainty and litigation arising from such uncertainty.
    ``(c) The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs shall have authority to issue guidelines for use by the 
agencies in the issuance of major guidance and other guidance. Such 
guidelines shall assure that each agency avoids issuing guidance 
documents that are inconsistent or incompatible with, or duplicative 
of, the law, its other regulations, or the regulations of other Federal 
agencies and drafts its guidance documents to be simple and easy to 
understand, with the goal of minimizing the potential for uncertainty 
and litigation arising from such uncertainty.''.

proceeding held under this section pursuant to section 553(d)(4) or

notice of proposed rule making under section 553(c), the matters to be

relevant matters and determinations, the matters and determinations 
described in subsections (b) and (f) of section 553.
    ``(g) Upon receipt of a petition for a hearing under this section, 
the agency shall grant the petition in the case of any major rule, 
unless the agency reasonably determines that a hearing would not 
advance consideration of the rule or would, in light of the need for 
agency action, unreasonably delay completion of the rule making. The 
agency shall publish its decision to grant or deny the petition when it 
renders the decision, including an explanation of the grounds for 
decision. The information contained in the petition shall in all cases 
be included in the administrative record. This subsection shall not

each agency shall publish in the Federal Register and place on its 
website a plan for the periodic review of rules issued by the agency 
which the head of the agency determines have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such determination 
shall be made without regard to whether the agency performed an 
analysis under section 604. The purpose of the review shall be to 
determine whether such rules should be continued without change, or 
should be amended or rescinded, consistent with the stated objectives 
of applicable statutes, to minimize any adverse significant economic 
impacts or maximize any beneficial significant economic impacts on a 
substantial number of small entities. Such plan may be amended by the 
agency at any time by publishing the revision in the Federal Register 
and subsequently placing the amended plan on the agency's website.
    ``(b) The plan shall provide for the review of all such agency 
rules existing on the date of the enactment of this section within 10 
years of the date of publication of the plan in the Federal Register 
and for review of rules adopted after the date of enactment of this 
section within 10 years after the publication of the final rule in the 
Federal Register. If the head of the agency determines that completion 
of the review of existing rules is not feasible by the established 
date, the head of the agency shall so certify in a statement published 
in the Federal Register and may extend the review for not longer than 2 
years after publication of notice of extension in the Federal Register. 
Such certification and notice shall be sent to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and the Congress.
    ``(c) The plan shall include a section that details how an agency 
will conduct outreach to and meaningfully include small businesses 
(including small business concerns owned and controlled by women, small 
business concerns owned and controlled by veterans, and small business 
concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals (as such terms are defined in the Small 
Business Act)) for the purposes of carrying out this section. The 
agency shall include in this section a plan for how the agency will 
contact small businesses and gather their input on existing agency 
rules.
    ``(d) Each agency shall annually submit a report regarding the 
results of its review pursuant to such plan to the Congress, the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, and, in the 
case of agencies other than independent regulatory agencies (as defined 
in section 3502(5) of title 44) to the Administrator of the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and 
Budget. Such report shall include the identification of any rule with 
respect to which the head of the agency made a determination described 
in paragraph (5) or (6) of subsection (e) and a detailed explanation of 
the reasons for such determination.
    ``(e) In reviewing a rule pursuant to subsections (a) through (d), 
the agency shall amend or rescind the rule to minimize any adverse 
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities 
or disproportionate economic impact on a specific class of small 
entities, or maximize any beneficial significant economic impact of the 
rule on a substantial number of small entities to the greatest extent 
possible, consistent with the stated objectives of applicable statutes. 
In amending or rescinding the rule, the agency shall consider the 
following factors:
            ``(1) The continued need for the rule.
            ``(2) The nature of complaints received by the agency from 
        small entities concerning the rule.

        the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
        Administration.
            ``(4) The complexity of the rule.
            ``(5) The extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates, or 
        conflicts with other Federal rules and, unless the head of the 
        agency determines it to be infeasible, State, territorial, and 
        local rules.
            ``(6) The contribution of the rule to the cumulative 
        economic impact of all Federal rules on the class of small 
        entities affected by the rule, unless the head of the agency 
        determines that such calculations cannot be made and reports 
        that determination in the annual report required under 
        subsection (d).
            ``(7) The length of time since the rule has been evaluated 
        or the degree to which technology, economic conditions, or 
        other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule.
    ``(f) Each year, each agency shall publish in the Federal Register 
and on its website a list of rules to be reviewed pursuant to such 
plan. The agency shall include in the publication a solicitation of 
public comments on any further inclusions or exclusions of rules from 
the list, and shall respond to such comments. Such publication shall 
include a brief description of the rule, the reason why the agency 
determined that it has a significant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities (without regard to whether it had prepared a 
final regulatory flexibility analysis for the rule), and request 
comments from the public, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small 
Business Administration, and the Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman 
concerning the enforcement of the rule.''.

                    (B) how the covered consent decree or settlement 
                agreement, if approved, would affect the discharge of 
                the duties described in subparagraph (A); and
                    (C) why the effects of the covered consent decree 
                or settlement agreement on the manner in which the

    (e) Submission by the Government.--

        submitted under this paragraph.
            (2) Terms.--A term described in this paragraph is--
                    (A) in the case of a covered consent decree, a term 
                that--
                            (i) converts into a nondiscretionary duty a 
                        discretionary authority of an agency to 
                        propose, promulgate, revise, or amend

                        have not been appropriated and that have not 
                        been budgeted for the regulatory action in 
                        question;
                            (iii) commits an agency to seek a 
                        particular appropriation or budget

                        committed to the agency by statute or the 
                        Constitution of the United States, without 
                        regard to whether the discretion was granted to 
                        respond to changing circumstances, to make 
                        policy or managerial choices, or to protect the 
                        rights of third parties; or
                            (v) otherwise affords relief that the court 
                        could not enter under its own authority upon a 
                        final judgment in the civil action; or

                            (i) that provides a remedy for a failure by 
                        the agency to comply with the terms of the 
                        covered settlement agreement other than the 
                        revival of the civil action resolved by the 
                        covered settlement agreement; and
                            (ii) that--
                                    (I) interferes with the authority 
                                of an agency to revise, amend, or issue 
                                rules under the procedures set forth in 
                                chapter 5 of title 5, United States 
                                Code, or any other statute or Executive

                                for a rulemaking that is the subject of 
                                the covered settlement agreement;
                                    (II) commits the agency to expend 
                                funds that have not been appropriated 
                                and that have not been budgeted for the 
                                regulatory action in question; or
                                    (III) for such a covered settlement 
                                agreement that commits the agency to 
                                exercise in a particular way discretion 
                                which was committed to the agency by 
                                statute or the Constitution of the 
                                United States to respond to changing 
                                circumstances, to make policy or 
                                managerial choices, or to protect the 
                                rights of third parties.

            (1) Amicus.--A court considering a proposed covered consent 
        decree or settlement agreement shall presume, subject to

        by any person who filed public comments or participated in a 
        public hearing on the covered consent decree or settlement

                incorporates adequate procedures for the agency to 
                comply with chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, 
                and other applicable statutes that govern rulemaking 
                and, unless contrary to the public interest, the 
                provisions of any Executive order that governs 
                rulemaking.
                    (B) Proposed covered settlement agreements.--For a

                for the agency to comply with chapter 5 of title 5, 
                United States Code, and other applicable statutes that 
                govern rulemaking and, unless contrary to the public 
                interest, the provisions of any Executive order that 
                governs rulemaking.
    (g) Annual Reports.--Each agency shall submit to Congress an annual

    If an agency moves a court to modify a covered consent decree or 
settlement agreement and the basis of the motion is that the terms of

other duties or due to changed facts and circumstances, the court shall 
review the motion and the covered consent decree or settlement 
agreement de novo.

SEC. 102. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this title is to increase accountability for and 
transparency in the Federal regulatory process. Section 1 of article I 
of the United States Constitution grants all legislative powers to 
Congress. Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its 
constitutional charge while failing to conduct appropriate oversight 
and retain accountability for the content of the laws it passes. By 
requiring a vote in Congress, the REINS Act will result in more 
carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an improved regulatory 
process, and a legislative branch that is truly accountable to the 
American people for the laws imposed upon them. Moreover, as a tax on 
carbon emissions increases energy costs on consumers, reduces economic 
growth and is therefore detrimental to individuals, families and 
businesses, the REINS Act includes in the definition of a major rule, 
any rule that implements or provides for the imposition or collection 
of a tax on carbon emissions.

        by coordinates in or derived by reference to the polygon 
        spatial data layer prepared by the Bureau of Land Management 
        and filed pursuant to paragraph (4), notwithstanding anomalies 
        that might later be discovered on the ground. The boundary 
        coordinates are locatable on the ground by use of global 
        positioning system signals. In cases where the location of the 
        stand boundary is disputed or is inconsistent with paragraph 
        (1), the location of boundary coordinates on the ground shall 
        be, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (5), finally and 
        conclusively determined for all purposes by the direct or 
        indirect use of global positioning system equipment with 
        accuracy specification of one meter or less.
            (3) Delineation of boundaries by forest service.--The O&C 
        Trust lands that, immediately before transfer to the O&C Trust, 
        were managed by the Forest Service are timber stands that can 
        be classified as having predominant stand ages of 125 years old 
        or less. Within 30 days after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall commence identification 
        of the boundaries of such stands, and the boundaries of all 
        such stands shall be identified and made available to the Board 
        of Trustees not later than 180 days following the creation of 
        the O&C Trust pursuant to subsection (a). In identifying the 
        stand boundaries, the Secretary may use geographic information 
        system data, satellite imagery, cadastral survey coordinates, 
        or any other means available within the time allowed. The 
        boundaries shall be provided to the Board of Trustees within 
        the time allowed in the form of a spatial data layer from which 
        coordinates can be derived that are locatable on the ground by 
        use of global positioning system signals. Except as provided in 
        paragraph (5), the boundaries of all timber stands constituting 
        the O&C Trust lands are finally and conclusively determined for 
        all purposes by coordinates in or derived by reference to the 
        data provided by the Secretary within the time provided by this 
        paragraph, notwithstanding anomalies that might later be 
        discovered on the ground. In cases where the location of the 
        stand boundary is disputed or inconsistent with paragraph (1), 
        the location of boundary coordinates on the ground shall be, 
        except as otherwise provided in paragraph (5), finally and 
        conclusively determined for all purposes by the boundary 
        coordinates provided by the Secretary as they are located on 
        the ground by the direct or indirect use of global positioning 
        system equipment with accuracy specifications of one meter or 
        less. All actions taken by the Secretary under this paragraph 
        shall be deemed to not involve Federal agency action or Federal 
        discretionary involvement or control.
            (4) Data and maps.--Copies of the data containing boundary 
        coordinates for the stands included in the O&C Trust lands, or 
        from which such coordinates are derived, and maps generally 
        depicting the stand locations shall be filed with the Committee 
        on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate, the Committee on 
        Natural Resources of the House of Representatives, and the 
        office of the Secretary concerned. The maps and data shall be 
        filed--
                    (A) not later than 90 days after the date of the 
                enactment of this Act, in the case of the lands 
                identified pursuant to paragraph (2); and
                    (B) not later than 180 days following the creation 
                of the O&C Trust pursuant to subsection (a), in the 
                case of lands identified pursuant to paragraph (3).
            (5) Adjustment authority and limitations.--
                    (A) No impact on determining title or property 
                ownership boundaries.--Stand boundaries identified 
                under paragraph (2) or (3) shall not be relied upon for 
                purposes of determining title or property ownership 
                boundaries. If the boundary of a stand identified under 
                paragraph (2) or (3) extends beyond the property 
                ownership boundaries of Oregon and California Railroad 
                Grant lands or O&C Region Public Domain lands, as such 
                property boundaries exist on the date of enactment of 
                this Act, then that stand boundary is deemed adjusted 
                by this subparagraph to coincide with the property 
                ownership boundary.
                    (B) Effect of data errors or inconsistencies.--Data 
                errors or inconsistencies may result in parcels of land 
                along property ownership boundaries that are 
                unintentionally omitted from the O&C Trust lands that 
                are identified under paragraph (2) or (3). In order to 
                correct such errors, any parcel of land that satisfies 
                all of the following criteria is hereby deemed to be 
                O&C Trust land:
                            (i) The parcel is within the ownership 
                        boundaries of Oregon and California Railroad 
                        Grant lands or O&C Region Public Domain lands 
                        on the date of the enactment of this Act.
                            (ii) The parcel satisfies the description 
                        in paragraph (1) on the date of enactment of 
                        this Act.
                            (iii) The parcel is not excluded from the 
                        O&C Trust lands pursuant to subsection (c)(2).
                    (C) No impact on land exchange authority.--Nothing 
                in this subsection is intended to limit the authority 
                of the Trust and the Forest Service to engage in land 
                exchanges between themselves or with owners of non-
                Federal land as provided elsewhere in this title.

    (a) Legal Status of Trust Lands.--Subject to the other provisions 
of this section, all right, title, and interest in and to the O&C Trust

        resources found thereon;
            (2) actions on the O&C Trust lands shall be deemed to 
        involve no Federal agency action or Federal discretionary 
        involvement or control and the laws of the State shall apply to 
        the surface estate of the O&C Trust lands in the manner 
        applicable to privately owned timberlands in the State; and
            (3) the O&C Trust shall be treated as the beneficial owner 
        of the surface estate of the O&C Trust lands for purposes of 
        all legal proceedings involving the O&C Trust lands.
    (b) Minerals.--
            (1) In general.--Mineral and other subsurface rights in the

        to the O&C Trust.
            (2) Rock and gravel.--
                    (A) Use authorized; purpose.--For maintenance or 
                construction on the road system under the control of 
                the O&C Trust or for non-Federal lands intermingled 
                with O&C Trust lands, the Board of Trustees may--
                            (i) utilize rock or gravel found within 
                        quarries in existence immediately before the 
                        date of the enactment of this Act on any Oregon 
                        and California Railroad Grant lands and O&C 
                        Region Public Domain lands, excluding those 
                        lands designated under subtitle C or 
                        transferred under subtitle D; and
                            (ii) construct new quarries on O&C Trust

                        may not exceed 5 acres.
                    (B) Exception.--The Board of Trustees shall not 
                construct new quarries on any of the lands transferred 
                to the Forest Service under section 321 or lands 
                designated under subtitle D.
    (c) Roads.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (b), the 
        Board of Trustees shall assume authority and responsibility 
        over, and have authority to use, all roads and the road system 
        specified in the following subparagraphs:
                    (A) All roads and road systems on the Oregon and 
                California Railroad and Grant lands and O&C Region 
                Public Domain lands owned or administered by the Bureau 
                of Land Management immediately before the date of the 
                enactment of this Act, except that the Secretary of 
                Agriculture shall assume the Secretary of Interior's 
                obligations for pro-rata maintenance expense and road 
                use fees under reciprocal right-of-way agreements for 
                those lands transferred to the Forest Service under 
                section 321. All of the lands transferred to the Forest 
                Service under section 321 shall be considered as part 
                of the tributary area used to calculate pro-rata 
                maintenance expense and road use fees.
                    (B) All roads and road systems owned or 
                administered by the Forest Service immediately before 
                the date of the enactment of this Act and subsequently 
                included within the boundaries of the O&C Trust lands.
                    (C) All roads later added to the road system for 
                management of the O&C Trust lands.

        under reciprocal rights-of-way agreements for those Oregon and 
        California Railroad Grant lands or O&C Region Public Domain 
        lands transferred to the Forest Service under section 321.
            (3) Compliance with clean water act.--All roads used, 
        constructed, or reconstructed under the jurisdiction of the O&C 
        Trust must comply with requirements of the Federal Water 
        Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) applicable to 
        private lands through the use of Best Management Practices 
        under the Oregon Forest Practices Act.
    (d) Public Access.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), public access to 
        O&C Trust lands shall be preserved consistent with the policies 
        of the Secretary concerned applicable to the O&C Trust lands as 
        of the date on which management authority over the surface 
        estate of the lands is transferred to the O&C Trust.
            (2) Restrictions.--The Board of Trustees may limit or 
        control public access for reasons of public safety or to 
        protect the resources on the O&C Trust lands.
    (e) Limitations.--The assets of the O&C Trust shall not be subject 
to the creditors of an O&C Trust county, or otherwise be distributed in 
an unprotected manner or be subject to anticipation, encumbrance, or 
expenditure other than for a purpose for which the O&C Trust was 
created.
    (f) Remedy.--An O&C Trust county shall have all of the rights and 
remedies that would normally accrue to a beneficiary of a trust. An O&C 
Trust county shall provide the Board of Trustees, the Secretary 
concerned, and the Attorney General with not less than 60 days notice 
of an intent to sue to enforce the O&C Trust county's rights under the 
O&C Trust.
    (g) Judicial Review.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), 
        judicial review of any provision of this title shall be sought

        any action brought under this paragraph within 180 days.
            (2) Decisions of board of trustees.--Decisions made by the 
        Board of Trustees shall be subject to judicial review only in 
        an action brought by an O&C County, except that nothing in this 
        title precludes bringing a legal claim against the Board of 
        Trustees that could be brought against a private landowner for 
        the same action.

SEC. 313. BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

    (a) In General.--Except as otherwise provided in this title, the 
O&C Trust lands will be managed by the Board of Trustees in compliance 
with all Federal and State laws in the same manner as such laws apply 
to private forest lands.
    (b) Timber Sale Plans.--The Board of Trustees shall approve and 
periodically update management and sale plans for the O&C Trust lands 
consistent with the purpose specified in section 311(b). The Board of 
Trustees may defer sale plans during periods of depressed timber 
markets if the Board of Trustees, in its discretion, determines that 
such delay until markets improve is financially prudent and in keeping 
with its fiduciary obligation to the O&C Trust counties.
    (c) Stand Rotation.--
            (1) 100-120 year rotation.--The Board of Trustees shall 
        manage not less than 50 percent of the harvestable acres of the 
        O&C Trust lands on a 100-120 year rotation. The acreage subject 
        to 100-120 year management shall be geographically dispersed 
        across the O&C Trust lands in a manner that the Board of 
        Trustees, in its discretion, determines will contribute to 
        aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem values.
            (2) Balance.--The balance of the harvestable acreage of the 
        O&C Trust lands shall be managed on any rotation age the Board 
        of Trustees, in its discretion and in compliance with 
        applicable State law, determines will best satisfy its 
        fiduciary obligation to provide revenue to the O&C Trust 
        counties.
            (3) Thinning.--Nothing in this subsection is intended to 
        limit the ability of the Board of Trustees to decide, in its 
        discretion, to thin stands of timber on O&C Trust lands.
    (d) Sale Terms.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the 
        Board of Trustees is authorized to establish the terms for sale 
        contracts of timber or other forest products from O&C Trust 
        lands.
            (2) Set aside.--The Board of Trustees shall establish a 
        program consistent with the program of the Bureau of Land 
        Management under a March 10, 1959 Memorandum of Understanding, 
        as amended, regarding calculation of shares and sale of timber 
        set aside for purchase by business entities with 500 or fewer 
        employees and consistent with the regulations in part 121 of 
        title 13, Code of Federal Regulations applicable to timber sale 
        set asides, except that existing shares in effect on the date 
        of enactment of this Act shall apply until the next scheduled 
        recomputation of shares. In implementing its program that is 
        consistent with such Memorandum of Understanding, the Board of 
        Trustees shall utilize the Timber Sale Procedure Handbook and 
        other applicable procedures of the Bureau of Land Management, 
        including the Operating Procedures for Conducting the Five-Year 
        Recomputation of Small Business Share Percentages in effect on 
        January 1, 2013.
            (3) Competitive bidding.--The Board of Trustees must sell 
        timber on a competitive bid basis. No less than 50 percent of 
        the total volume of timber sold by the Board of Trustees each

        the Bureau of Land Management as of January 1, 2013.
    (e) Prohibition on Export.--
            (1) In general.--As a condition on the sale of timber or 
        other forest products from O&C Trust lands, unprocessed timber 
        harvested from O&C Trust lands may not be exported.
            (2) Violations.--Any person who knowingly exports 
        unprocessed timber harvested from O&C Trust lands, who 
        knowingly provides such unprocessed timber for export by 
        another person, or knowingly sells timber harvested from O&C 
        Trust lands to a person who is disqualified from purchasing 
        timber from such lands pursuant to this section shall be 
        disqualified from purchasing timber or other forest products 
        from O&C Trust lands or from Federal lands administered under 
        this subtitle. Any person who uses unprocessed timber harvested 
        from O&C Trust lands in substitution for exported unprocessed 
        timber originating from private lands shall be disqualified 
        from purchasing timber or other forest products from O&C Trust 
        lands or from Federal lands administered under this subtitle.
            (3) Unprocessed timber defined.--In this subsection, the 
        term ``unprocessed timber'' has the meaning given such term in 
        section 493(9) of the Forest Resources Conservation and 
        Shortage Relief Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 620e(9)).
    (f) Integrated Pest, Disease, and Weed Management Plan.--The Board 
of Trustees shall develop an integrated pest and vegetation management 
plan to assist forest managers in prioritizing and minimizing the use 
of pesticides and herbicides approved by the Environmental Protection 
Agency and used in compliance with the Oregon Forest Practices Act. The 
plan shall optimize the ability of the O&C Trust to re-establish forest 
stands after harvest in compliance with the Oregon Forest Practices Act 
and to create diverse early seral stage forests. The plan shall allow 
for the eradication, containment and suppression of disease, pests, 
weeds and noxious plants, and invasive species as found on the State 
Noxious Weed List and prioritize ground application of herbicides and 
pesticides to the greatest extent practicable. The plan shall be 
completed before the start of the second year of the transition period. 
The planning process shall be open to the public and the Board of 
Trustees shall hold not less than two public hearings on the proposed 
plan before final adoption.
    (g) Access to Lands Transferred to Forest Service.--Persons acting 
on behalf of the O&C Trust shall have a right of timely access over 
lands transferred to the Forest Service under section 321 and Tribal 
lands transferred under subtitle D as is reasonably necessary for the 
Board of Trustees to carry out its management activities with regard to 
the O&C Trust lands and the O&C Trust to satisfy its fiduciary duties 
to O&C counties.
    (h) Harvest Area Tree and Retention Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--The O&C Trust lands shall include harvest 
        area tree and retention requirements consistent with State law.

        by section 324, shall be used to meet the retention 
        requirements applicable under paragraph (1).
    (i) Riparian Area Management.--
            (1) In general.--The O&C Trust lands shall be managed with 
        timber harvesting limited in riparian areas as follows:
                    (A) Streams.--For all fish bearing streams and all 
                perennial non-fish-bearing streams, there shall be no 
                removal of timber within a distance equal to the height 
                of one site potential tree on both sides of the stream 
                channel. For intermittent, non-fish-bearing streams, 
                there shall be no removal of timber within a distance 
                equal to one-half the height of a site potential tree 
                on both sides of the stream channel. For purposes of 
                this subparagraph, the stream channel boundaries are 
                the lines of ordinary high water.
                    (B) Larger lakes, ponds and reservoirs.--For all 
                lakes, ponds, and reservoirs with surface area larger 
                than one quarter of one acre, there shall be no removal 
                of timber within a distance equal to the height of one 
                site potential tree from the line of ordinary high 
                water of the water body.
                    (C) Small ponds and natural wetlands, springs and 
                seeps.--For all ponds with surface area one quarter 
                acre or less, and for all natural wetlands, springs and 
                seeps, there shall be no removal of timber within the 
                area dominated by riparian vegetation.
            (2) Measurements.--For purposes of paragraph (1), all 
        distances shall be measured along slopes, and all site 
        potential tree heights shall be average height at maturity of 
        the dominant species of conifer determined at a scale no finer 
        than the applicable fifth field watershed.
            (3) Rules of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1) shall 
        be construed--
                    (A) to prohibit the falling or placement of timber 
                into streams to create large woody debris for the 
                benefit of aquatic ecosystems; or
                    (B) to prohibit the falling of trees within 
                riparian areas as may be reasonably necessary for 
                safety or operational reasons in areas adjacent to the 
                riparian areas, or for road construction or maintenance 
                pursuant to section 312(c)(3).
    (j) Fire Protection and Emergency Response.--
            (1) Reciprocal fire protection agreements.--
                    (A) Continuation of agreements.--Subject to 
                subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D), any reciprocal fire 
                protection agreement between the State or any other 
                entity and the Secretary concerned with regard to 
                Oregon and California Railroad Grant lands and O&C 
                Region Public Domain lands in effect on the date of the 
                enactment of this Act shall remain in place for a 
                period of ten years after such date unless earlier 
                terminated by the State or other entity.
                    (B) Assumption of blm rights and duties.--The Board 
                of Trustees shall exercise the rights and duties of the 
                Bureau of Land Management under the agreements 
                described in subparagraph (A), except as such rights 
                and duties might apply to Tribal lands under subtitle 
                D.
                    (C) Effect of expiration of period.--Following the 
                expiration of the ten-year period under subparagraph 
                (A), the Board of Trustees shall continue to provide 
                for fire protection of the Oregon and California 
                Railroad Grant lands and O&C Region Public Domain 
                lands, including those transferred to the Forest 
                Service under section 331, through continuation of the 
                reciprocal fire protection agreements, new cooperative 
                agreements, or by any means otherwise permitted by law. 
                The means selected shall be based on the review by the 
                Board of Trustees of whether the reciprocal fire 
                protection agreements were effective in protecting the 
                lands from fire.
                    (D) Emergency response.--Nothing in this paragraph 
                shall prevent the Secretary of Agriculture from an 
                emergency response to a fire on the O&C Trust lands or 
                lands transferred to the Forest Service under section 
                321.
            (2) Emergency response to fire.--Subject to paragraph (1), 
        if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that fire on any of 
        the lands transferred under section 321 is burning uncontrolled 
        or the Secretary, the Board of Trustees, or contracted party 
        does not have readily and immediately available personnel and 
        equipment to control or extinguish the fire, the Secretary, or 
        any forest protective association or agency under contract or 
        agreement with the Secretary or the Board of Trustees for the 
        protection of forestland against fire, shall summarily and 
        aggressively abate the nuisance thus controlling and 
        extinguishing the fire.
    (k) Northern Spotted Owl.--So long as the O&C Trust maintains the 
100-120 year rotation on 50 percent of the harvestable acres required 
in subsection (c), the section 321 lands representing the best quality 
habitat for the owl are transferred to the Forest Service, and the O&C 
Trust protects currently occupied northern spotted owl nest sites 
consistent with the forest practices in the Oregon Forest Practices 
Act, management of the O&C Trust land by the Board of Trustees shall be 
considered to comply with section 9 of Public Law 93-205 (16 U.S.C. 
1538) for the northern spotted owl. A currently occupied northern 
spotted owl nest site shall be considered abandoned if there are no 
northern spotted owl responses following three consecutive years of 
surveys using the Protocol for Surveying Management Activities that May 
Impact Northern Spotted Owls dated February 2, 2013.

SEC. 315. DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUES FROM O&C TRUST LANDS.

    (a) Annual Distribution of Revenues.--
            (1) Time for distribution; use.--Payments to each O&C Trust 
        county shall be made available to the general fund of the O&C 
        Trust county as soon as practicable following the end of each 
        fiscal year, to be used as are other unrestricted county funds.
            (2) Amount.--The amount paid to an O&C Trust county in 
        relation to the total distributed to all O&C Trust counties for 
        a fiscal year shall be based on the proportion that the total 
        assessed value of the Oregon and California Railroad Grant 
        lands in each of the O&C Trust counties for fiscal year 1915 
        bears to the total assessed value of all of the Oregon and 
        California Railroad Grant lands in the State for that same 
        fiscal year. However, for the purposes of this subsection the 
        portion of the revested Oregon and California Railroad Grant 
        lands in each of the O&C Trust counties that was not assessed 
        for fiscal year 1915 shall be deemed to have been assessed at 
        the average assessed value of the Oregon and California 
        Railroad Grant lands in the county.
            (3) Limitation.--After the fifth payment made under this 
        subsection, the payment to an O&C Trust county for a fiscal 
        year shall not exceed 110 percent of the previous year's 
        payment to the O&C Trust county, adjusted for inflation based 
        on the consumer price index applicable to the geographic area 
        in which the O&C Trust counties are located.
    (b) Reserve Fund.--
            (1) Establishment of reserve fund.--The Board of Trustees

        practicable, the Board of Trustees shall establish and seek to 
        maintain an annual balance of $125,000,000 in the Reserve Fund, 
        to be derived from revenues generated from management 
        activities involving O&C Trust lands. All annual revenues 
        generated in excess of operating costs and payments to O&C 
        Trust counties required by subsection (a) and payments into the 
        Conservation Fund as provided in subsection (c) shall be 
        deposited in the Reserve Fund.
            (3) Expenditures from reserve fund.--The Board of Trustees 
        shall use amounts in the Reserve Fund only--
                    (A) to pay management and administrative expenses 
                or capital improvement costs on O&C Trust lands; and
                    (B) to make payments to O&C Trust counties when 
                payments to the counties under subsection (a) are

                year's payments.
    (c) O&C Trust Conservation Fund.--
            (1) Establishment of conservation fund.--The Board of 
        Trustees shall use a portion of revenues generated from 
        activity on the O&C Trust lands, consistent with paragraph (2), 
        to establish and maintain a O&C Trust Conservation Fund. The 
        O&C Trust Conservation Fund shall include no Federal 
        appropriations.
            (2) Revenues.--Following the transition period, five 
        percent of the O&C Trust's annual net operating revenue, after 
        deduction of all management costs and expenses, including the 
        payment required under section 317, shall be deposited to the 
        O&C Trust Conservation Fund.
            (3) Expenditures from conservation fund.--The Board of 
        Trustees shall use amounts from the O&C Trust Conservation Fund

                conservation easements from willing private landowners 
                in the State;
                    (B) to fund watershed restoration, remediation and 
                enhancement projects within the State; or
                    (C) to contribute to balancing values in a land 
                exchange with willing private landowners proposed under 
                section 323(b), if the land exchange will result in a 
                net increase in ecosystem benefits for fish, wildlife, 
                or rare native plants.

SEC. 316. LAND EXCHANGE AUTHORITY.

    (a) Authority.--Subject to approval by the Secretary concerned, the 
Board of Trustees may negotiate proposals for land exchanges with

        the O&C Trust lands proposed for exchange.
            (4) The proposed exchange is reasonably likely to increase 
        the net income to the O&C Trust counties over the next 20 years 
        and not decrease the net income to the O&C Trust counties over 
        the next 10 years.
    (c) Acreage Limitation.--The Secretary concerned shall not approve 
land exchanges under this section that, taken together with all 
previous exchanges involving the O&C Trust lands, have the effect of 
reducing the total acreage of the O&C Trust lands by more than five 
percent from the total acreage to be designated as O&C Trust land under 
section 311(c)(1).
    (d) Inapplicability of Certain Laws.--Section 3 of the Oregon 
Public Lands Transfer and Protection Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-321;

            (1) The non-Federal lands are completely within the State.
            (2) The non-Federal lands have high wildlife conservation 
        or recreation value or the exchange is necessary to increase 
        management efficiencies of lands administered by the Forest 
        Service for the purposes of the National Forest System.
            (3) The non-Federal lands have equal or greater value to 
        the Federal lands purposed for exchange or a balance of values 
        can be achieved--
                    (A) with a grant of funds provided by the O&C Trust 
                pursuant to section 315(c); or

            (1) The O&C Trust lands to be exchanged have high wildlife 
        value or ecological value or the exchange would facilitate 
        resource management or otherwise contribute to the management 
        efficiency of the lands administered by the Forest Service.
            (2) The exchange is requested or approved by the Board of 
        Trustees for the O&C Trust and will not impair the ability of 
        the Board of Trustees to meet its fiduciary responsibilities.
            (3) The lands to be exchanged by the Forest Service do not 
        contain stands of timber meeting the definition of old growth 
        established by the Old Growth Review Panel pursuant to section 
        324.
            (4) The lands to be exchanged are equal in acreage.
    (d) Acreage Limitation.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall not 
approve land exchanges under this section that, taken together with all 
previous exchanges involving the lands described in subsection (a),

   SUBDIVISION B--NATIONAL STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL MINERALS PRODUCTION

SEC. 100. SHORT TITLE.

    This subdivision may be cited as the ``National Strategic and 
Critical Minerals Production Act of 2014''.

SEC. 100A. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The industrialization of China and India has driven 
        demand for nonfuel mineral commodities, sparking a period of 
        resource nationalism exemplified by China's reduction in 
        exports of rare-earth elements necessary for 
        telecommunications, military technologies, healthcare 
        technologies, and conventional and renewable energy 
        technologies.
            (2) The availability of minerals and mineral materials are 
        essential for economic growth, national security, technological 
        innovation, and the manufacturing and agricultural supply 
        chain.
            (3) The exploration, production, processing, use, and 
        recycling of minerals contribute significantly to the economic 
        well-being, security and general welfare of the Nation.
            (4) The United States has vast mineral resources, but is 
        becoming increasingly dependent upon foreign sources of these 
        mineral materials, as demonstrated by the following:
                    (A) Twenty-five years ago the United States was 
                dependent on foreign sources for 30 nonfuel mineral 
                materials, 6 of which the United States imported 100 
                percent of the Nation's requirements, and for another 
                16 commodities the United States imported more than 60 
                percent of the Nation's needs.
                    (B) By 2011 the United States import dependence for 
                nonfuel mineral materials had more than doubled from 30 
                to 67 commodities, 19 of which the United States 
                imported 100 percent of the Nation's requirements, and 
                for another 24 commodities, imported more than 50 
                percent of the Nation's needs.
                    (C) The United States share of worldwide mineral 
                exploration dollars was 8 percent in 2011, down from 19 
                percent in the early 1990s.
                    (D) In the 2012 Ranking of Countries for Mining 
                Investment, out of 25 major mining countries, the 
                United States ranked last with Papua New Guinea in 
                permitting delays, and towards the bottom regarding 
                government take and social issues affecting mining.

  TITLE I--DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SOURCES OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL 
                                MINERALS

SEC. 101. IMPROVING DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC AND CRITICAL MINERALS.

    Domestic mines that will provide strategic and critical minerals 
shall be considered an ``infrastructure project'' as described in 
Presidential Order ``Improving Performance of Federal Permitting and 
Review of Infrastructure Projects'' dated March 22, 2012.

SEC. 102. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAD AGENCY.

    (a) In General.--The lead agency with responsibility for issuing a 
mineral exploration or mine permit shall appoint a project lead who 
shall coordinate and consult with cooperating agencies and any other 
agency involved in the permitting process, project proponents and 
contractors to ensure that agencies minimize delays, set and adhere to 
timelines and schedules for completion of the permitting process, set 
clear permitting goals and track progress against those goals.
    (b) Determination Under NEPA.--To the extent that the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 applies to any mineral exploration or 
mine permit, the lead agency with responsibility for issuing a mineral 
exploration or mine permit shall determine that the action to approve 
the exploration or mine permit does not constitute a major Federal 
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment 
within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 if 
the procedural and substantive safeguards of the permitting process 
alone, any applicable State permitting process alone, or a combination 
of the two processes together provide an adequate mechanism to ensure 
that environmental factors are taken into account.
    (c) Coordination on Permitting Process.--The lead agency with 
responsibility for issuing a mineral exploration or mine permit shall 
enhance government coordination for the permitting process by avoiding 
duplicative reviews, minimizing paperwork and engaging other agencies 
and stakeholders early in the process. The lead agency shall consider 
the following best practices:
            (1) Deferring to and relying upon baseline data, analyses 
        and reviews performed by State agencies with jurisdiction over 
        the proposed project.
            (2) Conducting any consultations or reviews concurrently 
        rather than sequentially to the extent practicable and when 
        such concurrent review will expedite rather than delay a 
        decision.
    (d) Schedule for Permitting Process.--At the request of a project 
proponent, the lead agency, cooperating agencies and any other agencies 
involved with the mineral exploration or mine permitting process shall 
enter into an agreement with the project proponent that sets time 
limits for each part of the permitting process including the following:
            (1) The decision on whether to prepare a document required 
        under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
            (2) A determination of the scope of any document required 
        under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
            (3) The scope of and schedule for the baseline studies 
        required to prepare a document required under the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
            (4) Preparation of any draft document required under the 
        National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
            (5) Preparation of a final document required under the 
        National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.
            (6) Consultations required under applicable laws.

        applicable law.
            (9) A final or any interim decisions.
    (e) Time Limit for Permitting Process.--In no case should the total 
review process described in subsection (d) exceed 30 months unless 
agreed to by the signatories of the agreement.
    (f) Limitation on Addressing Public Comments.--The lead agency is 
not required to address agency or public comments that were not 
submitted during any public comment periods or consultation periods 
provided during the permitting process or as otherwise required by law.
    (g) Financial Assurance.--The lead agency will determine the amount 
of financial assurance for reclamation of a mineral exploration or 
mining site, which must cover the estimated cost if the lead agency 
were to contract with a third party to reclaim the operations according 
to the reclamation plan, including construction and maintenance costs 
for any treatment facilities necessary to meet Federal, State or tribal 
environmental standards.
    (h) Application to Existing Permit Applications.--This section 
shall apply with respect to a mineral exploration or mine permit for 
which an application was submitted before the date of the enactment of 
this Act if the applicant for the permit submits a written request to 
the lead agency for the permit. The lead agency shall begin 
implementing this section with respect to such application within 30 
days after receiving such written request.
    (i) Strategic and Critical Minerals Within National Forests.--With 
respect to strategic and critical minerals within a federally 
administered unit of the National Forest System, the lead agency 
shall--
            (1) exempt all areas of identified mineral resources in 
        Land Use Designations, other than Non-Development Land Use 
        Designations, in existence as of the date of the enactment of 
        this Act from the procedures detailed at and all rules 
        promulgated under part 294 of title 36, Code for Federal 
        Regulations;
            (2) apply such exemption to all additional routes and areas 
        that the lead agency finds necessary to facilitate the 
        construction, operation, maintenance, and restoration of the 
        areas of identified mineral resources described in paragraph 
        (1); and
            (3) continue to apply such exemptions after approval of the 
        Minerals Plan of Operations for the unit of the National Forest 
        System.

SEC. 103. CONSERVATION OF THE RESOURCE.

    In evaluating and issuing any mineral exploration or mine permit, 
the priority of the lead agency shall be to maximize the development of 
the mineral resource, while mitigating environmental impacts, so that 
more of the mineral resource can be brought to the market place.

SEC. 104. FEDERAL REGISTER PROCESS FOR MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINING 
              PROJECTS.

    (a) Preparation of Federal Notices for Mineral Exploration and Mine 
Development Projects.--The preparation of Federal Register notices 
required by law associated with the issuance of a mineral exploration 
or mine permit shall be delegated to the organization level within the 
agency responsible for issuing the mineral exploration or mine permit. 
All Federal Register notices regarding official document availability, 
announcements of meetings, or notices of intent to undertake an action 
shall be originated and transmitted to the Federal Register from the 
office where documents are held, meetings are held, or the activity is 
initiated.
    (b) Departmental Review of Federal Register Notices for Mineral 
Exploration and Mining Projects.--Absent any extraordinary circumstance 
or except as otherwise required by any Act of Congress, each Federal 
Register notice described in subsection (a) shall undergo any required 
reviews within the Department of the Interior or the Department of 
Agriculture and be published in its final form in the Federal Register 
no later than 30 days after its initial preparation.
