        and ensure that the benefits of development support local 
        communities, under this title, the Secretary shall make every 
        effort to promote the development of onshore American energy, 
        and shall take into consideration the socioeconomic impacts, 
        infrastructure requirements, and fiscal stability for local 
        communities located within areas containing onshore energy 
        resources; and
            (3) the Congress will monitor the deployment of personnel 
        and material onshore to encourage the development of American 
        manufacturing to enable United States workers to benefit from 
        this title through good jobs and careers, as well as the

                       CHAPTER 4--JUDICIAL REVIEW

SEC. 1141. DEFINITIONS.

    In this chapter--
            (1) the term ``covered civil action'' means a civil action 
        containing a claim under section 702 of title 5, United States 
        Code, regarding agency action (as defined for the purposes of 
        that section) affecting a covered energy project on Federal 
        lands of the United States; and
            (2) the term ``covered energy project'' means the leasing 
        of Federal lands of the United States for the exploration, 
        development, production, processing, or transmission of oil, 
        natural gas, wind, or any other source of energy, and any 
        action under such a lease, except that the term does not 
        include any disputes between the parties to a lease regarding 
        the obligations under such lease, including regarding any 
        alleged breach of the lease.

SEC. 1142. EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR CERTAIN CIVIL ACTIONS RELATING TO 
              COVERED ENERGY PROJECTS.

    Venue for any covered civil action shall lie in the district court 
where the project or leases exist or are proposed.

SEC. 1143. TIMELY FILING.

    To ensure timely redress by the courts, a covered civil action must

date of the final Federal agency action to which it relates.

SEC. 1144. EXPEDITION IN HEARING AND DETERMINING THE ACTION.

    The court shall endeavor to hear and determine any covered civil 
action as expeditiously as possible.

SEC. 1145. STANDARD OF REVIEW.

decision shall be presumed to be correct, and the presumption may be 
rebutted only by the preponderance of the evidence contained in the 
administrative record.

SEC. 1146. LIMITATION ON INJUNCTION AND PROSPECTIVE RELIEF.

    In a covered civil action, the court shall not grant or approve any 
prospective relief unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly 
drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of a 
legal requirement, and is the least intrusive means necessary to 
correct that violation. In addition, courts shall limit the duration of 
preliminary injunctions to halt covered energy projects to no more than 
60 days, unless the court finds clear reasons to extend the injunction. 
In such cases of extensions, such extensions shall only be in 30-day 
increments and shall require action by the court to renew the 
injunction.

SEC. 1147. LIMITATION ON ATTORNEYS' FEES.

    Sections 504 of title 5, United States Code, and 2412 of title 28, 
United States Code, (together commonly called the Equal Access to

party in such a covered civil action receive payment from the Federal 
Government for their attorneys' fees, expenses, and other court costs.

SEC. 1148. LEGAL STANDING.

    Challengers filing appeals with the Department of the Interior

        Secretary of Agriculture with regard to lands administered by 
        the Forest Service, shall develop and publish every 4 years a 
        Quadrennial Federal Onshore Energy Production Strategy. This 
        Strategy shall direct Federal land energy development and 
        department resource allocation in order to promote the energy 
        and national security of the United States in accordance with 
        Bureau of Land Management's mission of promoting the multiple 
        use of Federal lands as set forth in the Federal Land Policy 
        and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.).
            ``(2) In developing this Strategy, the Secretary shall 
        consult with the Administrator of the Energy Information 
        Administration on the projected energy demands of the United

        Federal onshore lands can put the United States on a trajectory 
        to meet that demand during the next 4-year period. The 
        Secretary shall consider how Federal lands will contribute to 
        ensuring national energy security, with a goal for increasing

all necessary authority to make determinations regarding which 
additional lands will be made available in order to meet the production 
objectives established by strategies under this section. The Secretary 
shall also take all necessary actions to achieve these production 
objectives unless the President determines that it is not in the 
national security and economic interests of the United States to 
increase Federal domestic energy production and to further decrease 
dependence upon foreign sources of energy. In administering this 
section, the relevant Secretary shall only consider leasing Federal 
lands available for leasing at the time the lease sale occurs.
    ``(d) State, Federally Recognized Indian Tribes, Local Government, 
and Public Input.--In developing each strategy, the Secretary shall 
solicit the input of affected States, federally recognized Indian 
tribes, local governments, and the public.

siting, or production that will prevent meeting the goal. In addition, 
the Secretary shall make suggestions to help meet any shortfalls in 
meeting the production goals.

environmental impact statement. This programmatic environmental impact 
statement will be deemed sufficient to comply with all requirements 
under that Act for all necessary resource management and land use plans 
associated with the implementation of the strategy.
    ``(g) Congressional Review.--At least 60 days prior to publishing a 
proposed strategy under this section, the Secretary shall submit it to 
the President and the Congress, together with any comments received

State, federally recognized Indian tribe, or local government was not 
accepted.

of this section, the term `strategic and critical energy minerals' 
means those that are necessary for the Nation's energy infrastructure 
including pipelines, refining capacity, electrical power generation and

plaintiff does not ultimately prevail, the court shall award to the 
defendant (including any intervenor-defendants), other than the United 
States, fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection 
with the energy related action, unless the court finds that the 
position of the plaintiff was substantially justified or that special 
circumstances make an award unjust. Whether or not the position of the 
plaintiff was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis 
of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the energy 
related action for which fees and other expenses are sought.
    (f) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply:

                            (i) any person or entity to conduct 
                        activities on Indian Land, which activities

            (4) Ultimately prevail.--The phrase ``ultimately prevail'' 
        means, in a final enforceable judgment, the court rules in the 
        party's favor on at least one cause of action which is an 
        underlying rationale for the preliminary injunction, 
        administrative stay, or other relief requested by the party, 
        and does not include circumstances where the final agency 
        action is modified or amended by the issuing agency unless such 
        modification or amendment is required pursuant to a final
