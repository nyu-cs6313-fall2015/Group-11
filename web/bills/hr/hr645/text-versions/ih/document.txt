        consumer report, or cause a consumer report or investigative 
        consumer report to be procured, with respect to any consumer

        consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, or credit 
        capacity--
                    ``(A) for employment purposes; or

                holds, employment with a State or local government 
                agency which otherwise requires use of a consumer 
                report.
                    ``(C) When the consumer applies for, or currently 
                holds, a supervisory, managerial, professional, or 
                executive position at a financial institution.
                    ``(D) When otherwise required by law.

        The exceptions described in paragraph (3) shall have no effect 
        upon the other requirements of this Act, including requirements
