 To expand retroactive eligibility of the Army Combat Action Badge to 
  include members of the Army who participated in combat during which 
 they personally engaged, or were personally engaged by, the enemy at 
                 any time on or after December 7, 1941.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. RETROACTIVE AWARD OF ARMY COMBAT ACTION BADGE.

    (a) Authority To Award.--The Secretary of the Army may award the 
Army Combat Action Badge (established by order of the Secretary of the 
Army through Headquarters, Department of the Army Letter 600-05-1, 
dated June 3, 2005) to a person who, while a member of the Army, 
participated in combat during which the person personally engaged, or 
was personally engaged by, the enemy at any time during the period 
beginning on December 7, 1941, and ending on September 18, 2001 (the 
date of the otherwise applicable limitation on retroactivity for the 
award of such decoration), if the Secretary determines that the person 
has not been previously recognized in an appropriate manner for such 
participation.
    (b) Procurement of Badge.--The Secretary of the Army may make 
arrangements with suppliers of the Army Combat Action Badge so that 
eligible recipients of the Army Combat Action Badge pursuant to 
subsection (a) may procure the badge directly from suppliers, thereby 
eliminating or at least substantially reducing administrative costs for 
the Army to carry out this section.
