SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) There is enormous potential for increasing renewable 
        energy production and energy efficiency installation in the 
        United States.
            (2) A major barrier to rapid expansion of renewable energy 
        and energy efficiency is upfront capital costs. Government tax 
        incentives and other assistance programs have proven beneficial 
        in encouraging private sector development, manufacturing and 
        installation of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects 
        nationwide. However, these government incentives are not 
        currently meeting demand from the private sector, and we are 
        not taking full advantage of the potential for clean energy and 
        transportation, as well as energy efficiency in the United 
        States.
            (3) Other nations, including China and Germany are ahead of 
        the United States in manufacturing and deploying various clean 
        energy technologies, even though the United States invented 
        many of these technologies.
            (4) Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency 
        projects in the United States create green jobs for U.S. 
        citizens across the United States. Hundreds of thousands of 
        jobs could be created through expanded government support for 
        clean energy and energy efficiency.
            (5) As Americans choose energy efficiency and clean energy 
        and transportation, it reduces our dependence on foreign oil 
        and improves our energy security.
            (6) Bonds are a low-cost method for encouraging clean 
        energy, not requiring direct budget allocations or 
        expenditures. The projects supported through Clean Energy 
        Victory Bonds will create jobs and business revenues that will 
        increase Federal tax revenues, while simultaneously reducing 
        health and environmental costs incurred by the Federal 
        Government nationwide.
            (7) In World War II, over 80 percent of American households 
        purchased Victory Bonds to support the war effort, raising over 
        $185 billion, or over $2 trillion in today's dollars.

                  TITLE I--CLEAN ENERGY VICTORY BONDS

                the Treasury may identify.
            (3) Limitation.--There are authorized to be appropriated 
        for such promotional activities not more than--
                    (A) $10,000,000 in the first year after the date of 
                the enactment of this Act, and
                    (B) $2,000,000 in each year thereafter.
    (e) Future Capitalization.--
            (1) In general.--After the initial capitalization limit is 
        reached under subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury may 
        issue additional Clean Energy Victory Bonds on the credit of 
        the United States.
            (2) Single issue limitation.--No such additional issue may 
        exceed $7,500,000,000.
            (3) Aggregate limitations.--The aggregate of any such 
        additional issues during the 4-year period beginning on the day

        any such additional issues after the expiration of such 4-year 
        period may not exceed $50,000,000,000.

investments, and may be accepted as security for all fiduciary, trust, 
and public funds, the investment or deposit of which shall be under the 
authority or control of the United States or any officer or officers 
thereof.
