Terminates such a designation when the President certifies to Congress that either or both of these circumstances no longer apply.\n\nDeems Syria to be a country of conflict concern.\n\nDirects the President, with respect to a country of conflict concern, to require a U.S. national to obtain a license to: (1) travel to it, or (2) provide material support to entities that are engaged in armed conflict in it. Applies specified penalties to a person who violates such requirements."
