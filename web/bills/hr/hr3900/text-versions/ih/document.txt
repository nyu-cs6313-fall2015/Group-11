subsections:
    ``(e) Implementation of Directive.--In carrying out the directive 
issued under subsection (a)(1), the head of each element of the 
intelligence community shall--
            ``(1) provide the Comptroller General with timely access to 
        information concerning the programs and activities of the 
        intelligence community for any audit, investigation, program 
        evaluation, report, or review for which the Comptroller General 
        considers such information necessary; and
            ``(2) in providing such access--
                    ``(A) cooperate with the Comptroller General to the 
                fullest extent possible and provide timely responses to 
                requests for information;
                    ``(B) not categorically deny the Comptroller 
                General access to information requested in furtherance 
                of an audit or evaluation;
                    ``(C) carefully consider requests for information 
                based on consultation with the Comptroller General;
                    ``(D) work with the Comptroller General to explore 
                alternative means to accommodate a request for access 
                to specific information if the head of an element of 
                the intelligence community determines that such element 
                is unable to provide the Comptroller General with 
                access to the specific information requested; and
                    ``(E) narrowly construe any limitation on access to 
                information by the Comptroller General described in 
                such directive.
    ``(f) Congressional Notification of Implementation.--
            ``(1) Denials of access.--If, after following the 
        requirements of this section and the directive issued under 
        subsection (a)(1), the head of an element of the intelligence 
        community determines that such element cannot comply with a 
        request by the Comptroller General for access to information, 
        the head of such element shall, in a timely manner and at the 
        same time as the head of such element notifies the Comptroller 
        General of the denial of access to such information, submit to 
        the Director of National Intelligence, the Comptroller General, 
        and Congress a written justification for denying such access.
            ``(2) Semiannual reports.--
                    ``(A) Director of national intelligence.--The 
                Director of National Intelligence shall semiannually 
                submit to Congress and the Comptroller General in 
                electronic form a report describing any instances in 
                which the head of an element of the intelligence 
                community denied the Comptroller General access to 
                information that the Comptroller General requested, 
                including the written justification for such denial 
                submitted to the Comptroller General in accordance with 
                paragraph (1).
                    ``(B) Comptroller general.--Not later than 30 days 
                after receiving a report in accordance with 
                subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General shall submit 
                to Congress in electronic form a report containing any 
                comments the Comptroller General considers appropriate 
                in response to such report.''.
