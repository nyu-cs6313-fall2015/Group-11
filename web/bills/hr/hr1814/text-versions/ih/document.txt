subparagraph:
                    ``(C) Additional religious exemption.--
                            ``(i) In general.--Such term shall not 
                        include an individual for any month during a

                        statement, as part of the return of tax for the 
                        taxable year, that the individual was not 
                        covered under minimum essential coverage at any 
                        time during such taxable year and that the 
                        individual's sincerely held religious beliefs 
                        would cause the individual to object to medical 
                        health care that would be covered under such 
                        coverage.
                            ``(ii) Nullified if receipt of medical

                        shall not apply to an individual for any month 
                        during a taxable year if the individual 
                        received medical health care during the taxable 
                        year.
