To amend section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide 
 an additional religious exemption from the individual health coverage 
                                mandate.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

    This Act may be cited as the ``Equitable Access to Care and Health 
Act'' or the ``EACH Act''.

SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION TO HEALTH COVERAGE MANDATE.

    (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 5000A(d) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraph:
                    ``(C) Additional religious exemption.--
                            ``(i) In general.--Such term shall not 
                        include an individual for any month during a 
                        taxable year if such individual files a sworn 
                        statement, as part of the return of tax for the 
                        taxable year, that the individual was not 
                        covered under minimum essential coverage at any 
                        time during such taxable year and that the 
                        individual's sincerely held religious beliefs 
                        would cause the individual to object to medical 
                        health care that would be covered under such 
                        coverage.
                            ``(ii) Nullified if receipt of medical 
                        health care during taxable year.--Clause (i) 
                        shall not apply to an individual for any month 
                        during a taxable year if the individual 
                        received medical health care during the taxable 
                        year.
