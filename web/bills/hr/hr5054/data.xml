  <summary>7/10/2014--Introduced.
Veterans' Whistleblower and Patient Protection Act of 2014 - Establishes within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) an Office of Whistleblower and Patient Protection.

Requires the Director of such Office to establish a dedicated Internet website and toll-free telephone number for any individual to file a complaint regarding an alleged prohibited personnel practice committed by a VA officer or employee or the safety of a patient at a VA medical facility.

Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to refer to the Director for investigation any such complaint the Secretary receives directly. Prohibits the Secretary from referring any such complaint to any other element of the VA.

Requires the Secretary to ensure that VA employees located at a medical facility are able to efficiently refer any such complaints received to the Director. Prohibits the Director from disclosing the identity of any individual who files such a complaint without the individual's consent, except when necessary because of an imminent danger to public health or safety or imminent violation of any criminal law.

Requires the Director to: (1) investigate each complaint to determine whether there is a substantial likelihood that it discloses a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific danger to public health and safety; (2) make such determination within 240 days after its receipt; (3) notify the Secretary upon making a positive determination and refer the complaint, as appropriate, to the head of the appropriate federal department or agency; and (4) coordinate with the VA's Inspector General and Special Counsel to avoid duplicative actions.</summary>
