                                 A BILL


 
    To protect the academic futures of collegiate student athletes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Collegiate Student 
Athlete Protection Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Institutions of higher education that have athletic 
        programs that offer athletically related student aid 
        collectively generate billions of dollars annually from 
        contracts for media rights, and the revenue from such contracts 
        would not exist without the efforts of student athletes.
            (2) Providing adequate health and safety protection for 
        student athletes can help prevent serious injury and death.
            (3) Current and former student athletes are often left to 
        pay for medical expenses incurred from injuries suffered while 
        participating in intercollegiate athletics.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) institutions of higher education exist to further 
        educate, and to provide an opportunity to acquire a degree to, 
        all students who attend such institutions;
            (2) institutions of higher education should ensure that a 
        sports-related injury does not hinder the opportunity of a 
        student athlete to graduate from the institution of higher 
        education the student athlete attends at the time of such 
        injury;
            (3) institutions of higher education should make graduation 
        of all student athletes a priority, regardless of the on-field 
        performance of the student athletes;
            (4) institutions of higher education should provide student 
        athletes with the same due process protections afforded to 
        students who do not participate in athletics;
            (5) acknowledging the bodily risks taken by the student 
        athletes, institutions of higher education should ensure that 
        student athletes who otherwise could not afford proper health 
        insurance are provided such insurance to pay for sports-related 
        injuries; and
            (6) due to the record level of revenues that athletic 
        programs provide for institutions of higher education, such 
        institutions have the responsibility to provide student 
        athletes with the highest level of education, and to provide 
        effective efforts to ensure that student athletes attain higher 
        education degrees from such institutions.

SEC. 2. PROGRAM PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS.

    (a) New Requirement for Programs of Assistance.--Section 487(a) of 
the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1094(a)) is amended by

        athletic program and that annually receives $10,000,000 or more 
        in income derived from media rights (as calculated in 
        accordance with subparagraph (B)) for the athletic program of 
        the institution, the institution will comply with the 
        requirements under subsection (k).
            ``(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, an institution of

                    ``(i) annual income derived from any contract for 
                media rights signed with any media entity by the 
                institution, determined by averaging the income derived 
                from the contract annually over the lifetime of the 
                contract;
                    ``(ii) disbursements to the institution as a member 
                institution of an athletic conference, representing 
                member shares of the media rights of such conference;

                    ``(iii) disbursements to the institution as a 
                participant in an event that is hosted by an entity
