                                 A BILL


 
 To ensure that women seeking an abortion receive an ultrasound and an 
opportunity to review the ultrasound before giving informed consent to 
                          receive an abortion.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Heartbeat Informed Consent Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The presence of a heartbeat in a woman's unborn child 
        will be a material consideration to many women contemplating 
        abortion.
            (2) The presence of a heartbeat in a woman's unborn child 
        is a developmental fact that illustrates to the woman that her 
        baby is already alive.
            (3) On about the 21st or 22nd day after fertilization 
        (which is about 5 weeks from the first day of the last 
        menstrual period) the heart of an unborn child begins to beat.
            (4) The heartbeat of an unborn child can be visually 
        detected at an early stage of pregnancy using an ultrasound 
        machine, typically, at 4 to 4.5 weeks after fertilization (6 to 
        6.5 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period) on 
        transvaginal ultrasound, and at 5.5 to 6 weeks after 
        fertilization (7.5 to 8 weeks from the first day of the last 
        menstrual period) on transabdominal ultrasound.
            (5) The heartbeat of an unborn child can be made audible at 
        later stages, including by using a handheld Doppler fetal 
        monitor.
            (6) Less than five percent of all natural pregnancies end 
        in spontaneous miscarriage after detection of cardiac activity. 
        A fetal heartbeat is therefore a key medical indicator that an 
        unborn child is likely to achieve the capacity for live birth.
            (7) The observation of a heartbeat in a woman's unborn 
        child, when a heartbeat has been detected, is an important 
        component of full informed consent.
            (8) Ensuring full informed consent for an abortion is 
        imperative, because of the profound physical and psychological 
        risks of an abortion. As the Supreme Court has observed, 
        ``[t]he medical, emotional, and psychological consequences of 
        an abortion are serious and can be lasting.'' H.L. v. Matheson, 
        450 U.S. 398, 411 (1981). The woman's decision whether to abort 
        ``is an important, and often a stressful one, and it is 
        desirable and imperative that it be made with full knowledge of 
        its nature and consequences.'' Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 
        428 U.S. 52, 67 (1976). ``Whether to have an abortion requires 
        a difficult and painful moral decision,'' in which ``some women 
        come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once 
        created and sustained,'' and ``[s]evere depression and loss of 
        esteem can follow . . . The State has an interest in ensuring 
        so grave a choice is well informed. It is self-evident that a 
        mother who comes to regret her choice to abort must struggle 
        with grief more anguished and sorrow more profound when she 
        learns, only after the event, what she once did not know . . 
        .'' Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 159-160 (2007).
            (9) Requiring providers to give a woman an opportunity to 
        observe her unborn child's heartbeat is constitutionally 
        permissible, and the ultrasound image of an unborn child is 
        truthful, nonmisleading information. ``In attempting to ensure 
        that a woman apprehend the full consequences of her decision, 
        the State furthers the legitimate purpose of reducing the risk 
        that a woman may elect an abortion, only to discover later, 
        with devastating psychological consequences, that her decision 
        was not fully informed. If the information the State requires 
        to be made available to the woman is truthful and not 
        misleading, the requirement may be permissible.'' (Opinion of 
        O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 
        U.S. 833, 882 (1992)).
            (10) Further, recent research, taking into account 22 
        studies with control groups and more than 877,000 women over a 
        14-year period, finds that women who have had an abortion have 
        an 81 percent increased risk for mental health problems and 10 
        percent of the mental health problems of women who have had an 
        abortion are directly attributed to abortion.

        specific medical conditions that support such determination and 
        include such certification in the medical file of the pregnant 
        woman. The certification shall be kept by the abortion provider

been performed in violation of this title, or the parent or legal 
guardian of such a woman if she is an unemancipated minor, may commence 
a civil action against the abortion provider for any knowing or 
reckless violation of this title for actual and punitive damages.''.

SEC. 4. PREEMPTION.

    Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall be 
construed to preempt any provision of State law to the extent that such 
State law establishes, implements, or continues in effect greater 
disclosure requirements regarding abortion than those provided under 
this Act and the amendments made by this Act.

SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY.

    If any provision of this Act, an amendment by this Act, or the 
application of such provision or amendment to any person or
