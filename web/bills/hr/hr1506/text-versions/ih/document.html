                                 A BILL


 
To reduce the number of nuclear-armed submarines operated by the Navy, 
  to prohibit the development of a new long-range penetrating bomber 
 aircraft, to reduce the number of intercontinental ballistic missiles 
     operated by the Department of Defense, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Smarter Approach to Nuclear 
Expenditures Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the U.S.S.R. no longer 
        exists, and the Cold War is over. The nature of threats to the 
        national security and military interests of the United States 
        has changed. However, the United States continues to maintain 
        an enormous arsenal of nuclear weapons and delivery systems 
        that were devised with the Cold War in mind.
            (2) The current nuclear arsenal of the United States 
        includes approximately 5,000 total nuclear warheads, of which 
        approximately 2,000 are deployed with three delivery 
        components: long-range strategic bomber aircraft, land-based 
        intercontinental ballistic missiles, and submarine-launched 
        ballistic missiles. The bomber fleet of the United States 
        comprises 93 B-52 and 20 B-2 aircraft. The United States 
        maintains 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The United 
        States also maintains 14 Ohio-class submarines, up to 12 of 
        which are deployed at sea. Each of these submarines is armed 
        with up to 96 independently targetable nuclear warheads.
            (3) This Cold War-based approach to nuclear security comes 
        at significant cost. Over the next 10 years, the United States 
        will spend hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining its 
        nuclear force. A substantial decrease in the nuclear arsenal of 
        the United States is prudent for both the budget and national 
        security.
            (4) The national security interests of the United States 
        can be well served by reducing the total number of deployed 
        nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, as suggested by 
        the Department of Defense's January 2012 strategic guidance 
        titled ``Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st 
        Century Defense''. Furthermore, a number of arms control, 
        nuclear, and national security experts have urged the United 
        States to reduce the number of deployed nuclear warheads to no 
        more than 1,000.
            (5) Economic security and national security are linked and 
        both will be well served by smart defense spending. Admiral 
        Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated on 
        June 24, 2010, that ``Our national debt is our biggest national 
        security threat'' and on August 2, 2011, stated that ``I 
        haven't changed my view that the continually increasing debt is 
        the biggest threat we have to our national security.''.
            (6) The Government Accountability Office has found that 
        there is significant waste in the construction of the nuclear 
        facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration of 
        the Department of Energy.
