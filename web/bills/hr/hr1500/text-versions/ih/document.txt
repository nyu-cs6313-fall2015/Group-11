                                 A BILL


 
To amend section 9A of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act 
 to require that local school wellness policies include a requirement 
that students receive 50 hours of school nutrition education per school 
                                 year.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Nutrition Education Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Section 9A of the Richard B. Russell National School 
        Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758b) requires all local educational 
        agencies participating in a program authorized by the Richard 
        B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) 
        or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) to 
        establish a local school wellness policy for schools under the 
        jurisdiction of local educational agency that include nutrition 
        promotion and education. However, there are no specific 
        requirements regarding the amount of time or type of classes 
        that school children have to spend or take in nutrition 
        education.
            (2) Some schools include in their health education classes 
        some general information about nutrition, but there are no 
        specific guidelines of what the minimum requirements should be. 
        The mean number of hours spent on nutrition education in the 
        first 4 years of school is only 13 hours per year. A minimum of 
        50 hours per year are thought to be necessary to influence 
        behavior.
            (3) Each local educational agency participating in a 
        program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School 
        Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) or the Child Nutrition Act 
        of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.) should have a minimum 
        requirement for amount of time per year students should spend 
        on nutrition education and the type of instruction that should 
        be provided as part of such education.

SEC. 3. SCHOOL NUTRITION EDUCATION REQUIREMENT.

                effectiveness of the requirements of school nutrition 
                education described in subparagraphs (A) through 
                (I);''.
