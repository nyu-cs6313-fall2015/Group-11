                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to prohibit 
 corporations which employ or retain registered lobbyists from making 
 expenditures or disbursements for electioneering communications under 
                   such Act, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Pick Your Poison 
Act of 2013''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Independent expenditures made in connection with 
        elections for public office, including those made by 
        corporations, give rise to corruption and the appearance of 
        corruption, as well as undue influence and access.
            (2) This corruption, and the appearance of this corruption, 
        threatens to cause the electorate to lose faith in our 
        democracy.

SEC. 2. BAN ON EXPENDITURES AND DISBURSEMENTS FOR ELECTIONEERING 
              COMMUNICATIONS BY CORPORATIONS EMPLOYING OR RETAINING 
              REGISTERED LOBBYISTS.

    Section 316 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 
441b) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(d) Special Rule for Corporations Employing or Retaining 
Registered Lobbyists.--A corporation may not make any expenditure, or 
make any disbursement for an electioneering communication, if it 
employs or retains a registered lobbyist under the Lobbying Disclosure 
Act of 1995.''.
