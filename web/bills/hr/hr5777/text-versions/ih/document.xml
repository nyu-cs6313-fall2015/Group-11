			 in its Notice 2014–21 is advisory, subject to public comment and not in
			 final form pending the expiration of the comment period. As such, Congress
			 believes that the current guidance is less than optimal for the American

			 regulations consistent with the following.</act-name></text></subsection><subsection id="idD733B68D2F404F8D97F1466EBB79516F"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Treatment as currency</header><text>It is the sense of Congress that virtual currencies should be treated as currency instead of
			 property in order to foster an equitable tax treatment and prevent a tax
			 treatment that would discourage the use of any cryptocurrency. Tax
			 treatment of cryptocurrency as property does not account for the
			 substantial illiquidity and highly limited acceptance and use of
			 cryptocurrency, and substantially and unfairly discourages taxpayers
			 engaging in a trade or business from using cryptocurrency in commerce.
			 This circumstance is likely to discourage economic activity and stifle
			 innovation and growth. At present, a taxpayer accepting cryptocurrency for
			 goods or services will be taxed on the fair market value of the
			 cryptocurrency despite the fact that exchange rates (from cryptocurrency
			 to conventional currency) are both highly volatile and published or
			 available only on a small number of proto-exchanges in the early stages of
			 development, acceptance and awareness by cryptocurrency users. As a
			 result, current tax treatment will measure income on the basis of an
			 illiquid and likely inaccurate fair market value that exceeds the
			 taxpayer’s true fair market value and hence income, resulting in the risk
			 of a consistent overtaxation or overpayment that will act as a strong
			 deterrent to or penalty for accepting cryptocurrency in payment. Such tax
			 treatment is inconsistent with the tax treatment of secured notes for
			 payment in trade or commerce, which recognizes a discount from the face
			 value of the note due to the illiquid nature of the payment. (Note: See
			 IRS Pub. 525 at 4.)</text></subsection><subsection id="id1FE3D1C61B4F45E98AF1C9685A59F3E8"><enum>(d)</enum><header>Revenue in trade or business; taxation upon monetizing event</header><text>It is the sense of Congress that taxpayers accepting cryptocurrency in trade or commerce should be
			 deemed to realize actual income only when cryptocurrency is monetized
			 through conversion or exchange into dollars or any official government
			 currency, and that fair market value should be calculated as net proceeds
			 from the conversion.  (Note: This treatment seeks to achieve the most
			 accurate and fair measure of actual income received, as distinguished from
			 theoretical income in the form of cryptocurrency which, until its
			 conversion to dollars, remains under substantial risk of diminution from
			 illiquidity or other conversion risks or inefficiencies. This treatment is
			 consistent with tax treatment of statutory stock options where the taxable
			 event is not the receipt or exercise of the option, but the sale of the
			 underlying stock for proceeds in cash. The goal here is to have income
			 taxed when the income is actual instead of theoretical and subject to
			 substantial if not total risk of loss through liquidity problems, exchange
			 problems or other barriers to monetization.)  Accordingly, as it is the
			 further sense of Congress that income on cryptocurrency received in trade
			 or business should be defined as the net proceeds from conversion of the
			 received cryptocurrency into dollars, the Service is hereby directed to
			 revise or issue interim regulations consistent herewith.</text></subsection><subsection id="id958E2E793C804A378E64DD984E0584DE"><enum>(e)</enum><header>Revenue from mining or creation of cryptocurrency</header><text>It is the sense of Congress that the Service’s guidance that taxpayers should have the fair market
			 value of the cryptocurrency they successfully <term>mine</term> or produce included in gross income is inequitable, overstates actual income by overstating fair
			 market value by not accounting for the liquidity risk or the risk that
			 substantial effort may yield no production, and strongly and unfairly
			 penalizes or discourages such income producing efforts and deters economic
			 growth, activity and innovation.  Accordingly, as it is the further sense
			 of Congress that mined produced cryptocurrency should be taxed as income
			 only when actual income is realized by a transfer and conversion of
			 proceeds into dollars, the Service is hereby directed to revise or issue
			 interim regulations consistent herewith.</text></subsection></section><section display-inline="no-display-inline" id="id7A948890735644A281DE0B0BFBCC4F30"><enum>6.</enum><header>Severability</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">If any provision of this title, or any amendment made by this title, or the application of that
