Requires the public disclosure of possible defects of motor vehicles or related equipment reported to the Secretary by motor vehicle manufacturers (Early Warning data).\n\nDirects the Secretary to require a manufacturer in cases where the defect has caused a fatality to provide, and make public, certain additional information in its report to the Secretary.\n\nDirects the Secretary to give public notice on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website of all inspections and investigations conducted by the Secretary to enforce a motor vehicle safety requirement or order, or that are related to a motor vehicle accident due to a possible defect.\n\nDirects the Secretary to: (1) take specified actions to improve public accessibility to vehicle safety information on NHTSA's website, and (2) promulgate rules requiring the senior senior official for safety for a corporation to be responsible for requests for information in NHTSA safety or compliance investigations.\n\nRequires the DOT Office of the Inspector General to study NHTSA use of Early Warning data.\n\nProhibits certain vehicle safety officials, for the one-year period after termination of NHTSA employment, from knowingly making any communication to or appearance before NHTSA on behalf of a manufacturer subject to NHTSA regulation in connection with any matter involving vehicle safety on which such person seeks official action by a NHTSA officer or employee.\n\nEstablishes the Vehicle Safety Fund to meet U.S. obligations in carrying out NHTSA vehicle safety programs. Requires the Secretary to assess and collect, for deposit in the Fund, a vehicle safety user fee from the manufacturer for each motor vehicle certified compliant with applicable motor vehicle safety standards.\n\nIncreases civil penalties for persons who violate federal motor vehicle safety requirements.\n\nRequires the Secretary to: (1) notify manufacturers of motor vehicles or motor vehicle equipment whose defect or noncompliance with federal motor vehicle safety standards presents a substantial likelihood of death or serious injury to the public, and (2) expedite proceedings for a decision and issuance of an imminent hazard order. Directs the Secretary to issue procedures for the issuance and enforcement of such orders.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from promulgating motor vehicle safety regulations that address preemption of state tort law without congressional authorization."
