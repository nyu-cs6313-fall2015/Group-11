Go to High School, Go to College Act - Amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to carry out (from July 1, 2014, through June 30, 2020) a program awarding Early College Federal Pell Grants to students to support their enrollment in, and completion of, postsecondary courses offered through early college high schools.

Deems students who would be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant if not for their enrollment in secondary school to be eligible for an Early College Federal Pell Grant upon their completion of a full-time postsecondary semester or its equivalent.

Allows students to receive Early College Federal Pell Grants in an amount equal to the cost of not more than four full-time postsecondary semesters or the equivalent while enrolled in postsecondary courses offered by an early college high school.
