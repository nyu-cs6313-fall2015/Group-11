                proof that the polar bear was legally harvested by the 
                person before February 18, 1997; or
                    ``(II) who has submitted, in support of a permit 
                application submitted before May 15, 2008, proof that 
                the polar bear was legally harvested by the person 
                before May 15, 2008, from a polar bear population from
