  <summary>5/30/2014--Introduced.
Prohibits federal funds from being used to enter into agreements with, make grants or awards to, or provide loans or loan guarantees to institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in a boycott of the Israeli government, economy, or academia.

Terminates the application of that prohibition to an IHE that the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Education, determines has ceased participating in such a boycott.</summary>
