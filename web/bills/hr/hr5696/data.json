States that Hong Kong is ineligible for treatment different from that accorded to China under U.S. laws or agreements unless the President certifies to Congress that Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous to justify different treatment.\n\nAuthorizes the President to waive such ineligibility if waiver is in the U.S. national interest and Congress is given a justification of the waiver on or before the date it takes effect."
