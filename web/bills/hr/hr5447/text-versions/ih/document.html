        bee' means any bee that is raised and housed in a managed hive 
        or other appropriate housing and used for honey production, 
        managed pollination of crops, or breeding for commercial 
        purposes.''.
    (b) Expedited Registration of Pesticides To Improve Managed

                        parasitic pests.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:
                    ``(D) An application for registration or an 
                amendment that is reasonably expected to improve the 
                health of managed pollinator bees, including managing 
                resistance to parasitic pests of managed pollinator 
                bees, shall qualify for expedited review according to 
                subparagraph (B) pursuant to the applicable decision 
                time review period under section 33.''.

        and Forestry of the Senate a report that addresses the extent 
        and scope of the threat to the health of managed pollinator 
        bees from--
                    (A) pathological factors, including the species of 
                parasitic mite known as Varroa mite (Varroa 
                destructor), other arthropod pests, and fungal, 
                microbial, and viral diseases; and
                    (B) environmental factors, including the habitat,

                parasitic pests of managed pollinator bees, including 
                products to mitigate resistance to products currently 
                available.
            (3) Definition of managed pollinator bee.--In this 
        subsection, the term ``managed pollinator bee'' means any bee
