                        business size standards, consistent with the 
                        principles of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 
                        which requires Federal agencies, including the 
                        Department of Health and Human Services, to 
                        fully consider during the rulemaking process

                        such subparagraph shall cover each of the years 
                        in which the rebasing adjustment under such 
                        section 1895(b)(3)(A)(iii) is to be applied; 
                        and
                            (ii) the Secretary shall include a 
                        cumulative analysis of other Medicare home 
                        health reimbursement reductions established by 
                        statute or regulation, consistent with the 
                        requirements of Executive Order 13563.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services shall submit to Congress a report on the study

                as a result of the findings of such study, the 
                Secretary intends to use the authority under section 
                1871 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395hh) to 
                modify the adjustment described in paragraph (1)(A) and 
                the extent of any such modification; and
                    (B) in the case the Secretary determines not to use 
                such authority, the rationale for such determination.
