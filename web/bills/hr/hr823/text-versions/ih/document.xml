			 that by restructuring NASA we can make the Agency less political and more
			 professional so that visionary NASA scientists, engineers, and astronauts will
			 continue to inspire future generations by their continuing mission: to explore
			 strange new worlds, to seek out new life, to boldly go where no one has gone
			 before.</text>
