    ``(a) In General.--In the case of any claim for disability 
compensation under chapter 11 of this title that is not adjudicated 
before the date that is 125 days after the date of the submittal of the 
claim, the Secretary shall pay to the claimant provisional benefits

payable to a claimant under this section is an amount equal to the 
lesser of the following:
            ``(1) The average amount payable to a person who receives 
        payments of compensation for the type of disability for which 
        the claimant submitted the claim.

misrepresentation, or bad faith on the part of the claimant.''.
