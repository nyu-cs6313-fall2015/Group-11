(Currently, students must take those tests in each of grades 3 through 8.) Authorizes a public school to administer the academic assessments in mathematics: (1) in each of grades 4, 6, and 8; or (2) in each of grades 4 and 8 if the school is at the 15th percentile or above for mathematics in the state or its students are making appropriate progress, as determined by the Secretary of Education, toward state mathematics achievement standards. Authorizes a public school to administer the academic assessments in reading or language arts: (1) in each of grades 3, 5, and 7; or (2) in each of grades 3 and 7 if the school is at the 15th percentile or above for reading or language arts or its students are making appropriate progress toward state reading or language arts achievement standards.\n\nExcludes limited English proficient students who are in their first 12 months of enrollment in a public school from the determination as to whether students are making AYP toward state academic achievement standards.\n\nProhibits the Secretary from waiving the application of any of this Act's provisions."
