			<paragraph id="H4A83CB5875684F63886A2518F6735240"><enum>(1)</enum><text>On July 5, 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services released more than 600 pages of a
			 final rule to implement the provisions of the Patient Protection and
			 Affordable Care Act and the health care provisions of the Health Care and
			 Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (commonly referred to as <quote>Obamacare</quote> or the <quote>ACA</quote>).</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H91304F7F037F41648BE9B71AA44A8966"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Such final rule included an announcement that the Federal Government would no longer verify that
			 each applicant for premium tax credits or cost-sharing reductions for
			 coverage offered through an Exchange established under the Patient
			 Protection and Affordable Care Act are actually qualified for such credits
			 or reductions. Instead, the Administration would rely on self-attestation
			 and sample audits of a sample population to <quote>protect</quote> the integrity of this new $1 trillion entitlement program.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HC188C32F97094073A4D9AD2FB57590B1"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Department of Health and Human Services later announced a change in such policy and stated it
			 would extend the sample population to 100 percent. This change, though
			 announced, was never made to the final rule, meaning there was no
			 guarantee to the American people that applicants would be verified.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H69F26701407E4F66A3B4FDAE7616F099"><enum>(4)</enum><text>It is estimated that not verifying eligibility for such credits and reductions could likely equate
			 to approximately $250 billion in fraudulent payments through payments of
			 such Obamacare premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H912D3BC0445C4B08ABEE19FA224D21E2"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The final rule provides that the Department of Health and Human Services will offer to perform this
			 verification procedure for States that are establishing a State-based
			 Exchange, but will be unable to do so until 2015. As a result, such States
			 will not be required to randomly verify employer-sponsored coverage until
			 2015.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H11497B395E7643629EE64162763DCED7"><enum>(6)</enum><text>In order to protect taxpayers after the Department of Health and Human Services failed to implement
			 a new rule that it would ensure Congress and taxpayers that verification
			 of eligibility would be performed, the House of Representatives advanced
			 legislation, H.R. 2775, the No Subsidies Without Verification Act. This
			 legislation would have provided the force of law to ensure that
			 verification would occur prior to the issuance of any Obamacare premium
			 tax credit or cost-sharing reduction.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HE7FCB20D086049A7BD0F66C6447BAF2A"><enum>(7)</enum><text>On September 12, 2013, this legislation was passed in the House of Representatives with bipartisan
			 support by a 235 to 191 vote margin.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HFAF1D656C8D74BD5820D6D482BF4CAD4"><enum>(8)</enum><text>On September 10, 2013, the Obama Administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy to H.R.
			 2775 that stated <quote>the Administration strongly opposes House passage of H.R. 2775 because the goal of the bill is
			 already being accomplished while the text of the bill would create delays
			 that could cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the
			 security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H50A644712C72492F852F8E11923C5A74"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The Statement of Administration Policy also stated that <quote>H.R. 2775 is unnecessary because the Secretary of Health and Human Services has already put in
			 place an effective and efficient system for verification of eligibility
			 for premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions.</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H8547EABFAC7A47EEB2CB49F9022AFAFB"><enum>(10)</enum><text>On October 16, 2013, the Senate removed the verification mechanism of H.R. 2775 and replaced it
			 with language that required a report to Congress by the Secretary of
			 Health and Human Services no later than January 1, 2014.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H04FA042DEB924DCD8EB04E585C376B03"><enum>(11)</enum><text>On January 1, 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services submitted a mandated report to
			 Congress entitled, <quote>Verification of Household Income and Other Qualifications for the Provision of Affordable Care At
			 Premium Tax Credits and Cost-Sharing Reductions</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HE2C3FD4F1536477899C435410EA617CC"><enum>(12)</enum><text>This report to Congress states, <quote>In accordance with statute and applicable implementing regulations, when a consumer submits an
			 application for insurance affordability programs (which include APTCs,
			 CSRs, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the
			 Basic Health Program (BHP)), the Exchange verifies information provided by
			 the consumer on the application as a component of making an eligibility
			 determination. The processes for verifying information in order to
			 determine eligibility for enrollment in a qualified health plan (QHP)
			 through the Exchange and for APTC under section 36B of the Internal
			 Revenue Code (the Code) and CSRs under section 1402 of the ACA are
			 specified in the ACA and its implementing regulations. Pursuant to both
			 statute and applicable regulations, the Exchanges have implemented
			 numerous processes to carry out the verification of information provided
			 by applicants.</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HF8DD3EB8FDB64D9898C846BCB4CFC61F"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Beginning in 2014, Federal subsidies have been made available to help individuals purchase health
			 insurance through an Exchange through premium tax credits and cost-sharing
			 reductions. On April 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services
			 delayed implementation of income ver­i­fi­ca­tion systems in order to
			 increase
			 sign-ups for health care plans through the healthcare.gov website.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H098BB64871AD4B9A9DADE4F9911A76F3"><enum>(14)</enum><text>Various reports indicate that the internal portions of the healthcare.gov website are yet to be
			 finalized, thus leaving the Department of Health and Human Services unable
			 to perform the verification it stated it was performing. The Obama
			 Administration is operating a new Federal entitlement program that fails
			 to prevent fraudulent subsidy claims before administered. In doing so, the
			 Department of Health and Human Services has created a new <quote>pay and chase</quote> program that places taxpayers at financial risk of fraudulent claims.</text>
