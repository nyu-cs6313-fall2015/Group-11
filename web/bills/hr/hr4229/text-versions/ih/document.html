SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following--
            (1) On February 12, 2014, also known in Venezuela as the 
        National Youth Day, students began protesting in several cities 
        against Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro's inability to stem 
        violent crime, his undemocratic actions, and a rapidly 
        deteriorating economy marked by high inflation and shortages of 
        consumer goods.
            (2) On February 12, 2014, a judge issued an arrest warrant 
        for Leopoldo Lopez, leader of the opposition party Voluntad 
        Popular, for unfounded allegations in connection with the 
        student protests.
            (3) On February 17, 2014, the Government of Venezuela 
        notified the United States Department of State that it had 
        declared 3 consular officers at the United States Embassy in 
        Venezuela personae non gratae.
            (4) On February 18, 2014, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez 
        turned himself in to Venezuelan authorities, was arrested, and 
        unjustly charged with criminal incitement, conspiracy, arson, 
        and intent to damage property.
            (5) Leopoldo Lopez is currently being held in a prison at a 
        military facility.
            (6) Nongovernmental human rights organizations have alleged 
        that the charges brought against Leopoldo Lopez appear to be a 
        politically motivated attempt to silence dissent in the 
        country.
            (7) As of March 13, 2014, there have been 24 people killed, 
        over 100 injured, and many persons unjustly detained in 
        relation to pro-democracy demonstrations throughout Venezuela.
            (8) On February 19, 2014, President Obama criticized the 
        Government of Venezuela for arresting protesters, called for 
        their release, and urged the government to focus on the 
        ``legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people''.
            (9) According to the Department of State's Country Reports 
        on Human Rights Practices for 2013 for Venezuela, ``The 
        principal human rights abuses reported during the year included 
        corruption, politicization in the judicial system, and 
        government actions to impede freedom of expression and restrict 
        freedom of the press. The government did not respect judicial 
        independence or permit judges to act according to the law 
        without fear of retaliation. The government used the judiciary 
        to intimidate and selectively prosecute political, union, 
        business, and civil society leaders who were critical of 
        government policies or actions. The government harassed and 
        intimidated privately owned television stations, other media 
        outlets, and journalists throughout the year, using threats, 
        fines, property seizures, targeted regulations, arrests, and 
        criminal investigations and prosecutions.''.
            (10) According to the Department of State's Country Reports 
        on Human Rights Practices for 2013 for Venezuela, ``The 
        following human rights problems were reported by NGOs, the 
        media, and in some cases the government itself: unlawful 
        killings, including summary killings by police elements; 
        torture and other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment; 
        harsh and life-threatening prison conditions and lack of due 
        process rights that contributed to widespread violence, riots, 
        injuries, and deaths in prisons; inadequate juvenile detention 
        centers; arbitrary arrests and detentions; corruption and 
        impunity in police forces; political prisoners; interference 
        with privacy rights; corruption at all levels of government; 
        threats against domestic NGOs; violence against women; anti-
        Semitism in the official media; trafficking in persons; 
        violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity; and 
        restrictions on workers' right of association.''.
            (11) According to Freedom House's Freedom in the World 
        report of 2013 on Venezuela, ``Nicolas Maduro, further weakened 
        the independent media, reduced the opposition's ability to 
        serve as a check on government policy, and made threats to 
        civil society groups.''.

SEC. 8. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON REDUCTION IN IMPORTATION OF PETROLEUM 
              AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS OF VENEZUELAN ORIGIN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On May 24, 2011, the United States Government decided 
        to impose sanctions on the state-owned oil company of Venezuela 
        called Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) under the Iran Sanctions 
        Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note), for 
        delivering at least two cargoes of reformate to Iran between 
        December 2010 and March 2011, worth approximately $50,000,000.
            (2) In 2012, Venezuela was the fourth largest foreign 
        supplier of crude oil to the United States.
            (3) In 2012, the United States imported less barrels of 
        total crude oil than in 2005.
            (4) According to the U.S. Energy Information 
        Administration, the United States imported approximately 24,000 
        barrels per day from Venezuela in 2013, compared to 29,000 
        barrels per day in 2012, a 17 percent decrease, and imports 
        from Venezuela have fallen by nearly half since 2004.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It should be the policy of the United 
States to reduce petroleum imports from Venezuela in order to prevent 
its leader Nicolas Maduro from using the profits from the sale of 
petroleum to fund his regime's oppression and human rights violations 
against the people of Venezuela, and to continue the existing downward 
trend of petroleum imports from Venezuela.

SEC. 9. COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO PROMOTE INTERNET FREEDOM AND ACCESS 
              TO INFORMATION.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of State, in consultation with heads of other Federal 
departments and agencies, as appropriate, shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees a comprehensive strategy to--
            (1) assist the people Venezuela to produce, access, and 
        share information freely and safely via the Internet;
            (2) increase the capabilities and availability of secure 
        mobile and other communications through connective technology 
        among human rights and democracy activists in Venezuela;
            (3) provide resources for digital safety training for media 
        and academic and civil society organizations in Venezuela;
            (4) increase emergency resources for the most vulnerable 
        human rights advocates seeking to organize, share information, 
        and support human rights in Venezuela;
            (5) expand surrogate radio, television, live stream, and 
        social network communications inside Venezuela;
            (6) expand activities to safely assist and train human 
        rights, civil society, and democracy activists in Venezuela to 
        operate effectively and securely;
            (7) expand access to proxy servers for democracy activists 
        in Venezuela; and
            (8) discourage telecommunications and software companies 
        from facilitating Internet censorship by the Government of 
        Venezuela.

SEC. 10. COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ENSURE THAT VENEZUELA WILL UPHOLD 
              DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional 
committees a comprehensive strategy to ensure that the Government of 
Venezuela will uphold--
            (1) free, fair, and transparent elections--
                    (A) conducted under the supervision of 
                internationally recognized observers; and
