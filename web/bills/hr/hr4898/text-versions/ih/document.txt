at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(e)(1) In carrying out this section, the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs shall determine that if any veteran has been waiting for 14 
days or longer for an appointment to receive hospital care or medical 
services, including primary care, in a Department facility that the 
Department facility is not capable of furnishing the care or services 
required. The Secretary shall ensure that such care or services are 
provided to such a veteran at a non-Department facility under a 
contract under this section.
    ``(2) If, in the course of receiving hospital care or medical 
services in a non-Department facility, a veteran is referred to another 
non-Department facility for specialty care, such referral shall be 
submitted to the Secretary who may reject such referral during the 72-
hour period following such submittal. If the Secretary does not reject 
the referral during such period, the Secretary shall ensure that such 
specialty care is provided to the veteran at a non-Department facility 
under a contract under this section.''.
