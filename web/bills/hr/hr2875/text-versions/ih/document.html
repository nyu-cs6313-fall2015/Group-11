SEC. 2. STUDIES.

    (a) Measures To Improve Flood Protection and Climate Resilience for 
New York City.--
            (1) Study.--The Secretary of the Army shall conduct a study 
        of measures to improve flood protection and climate resilience 
        for New York City, using both traditional engineering and green 
        infrastructure technologies.
            (2) Contents.--In conducting the study, the Secretary 
        shall--
                    (A) assess traditional engineering solutions,

                    (B) assess, in consultation with the Administrator 
                of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
                the use of alternative approaches, including oyster 
                reef restoration, tidal wetland restoration and 
                construction, and other natural designs that reduce 
                storm surge impacts and retain storm water while 
                providing additional environmental benefits;
                    (C) identify the cost and time associated with 
                implementing the measures described in subparagraphs

                    (D) make a recommendation as to which of such 
                measures would provide the greatest protection for New 
                York City coastal communities and critical 
                infrastructure from an event of a magnitude that is 
                equal to or greater than Hurricane Sandy.

        Secretary shall carry out the activities under this section in
