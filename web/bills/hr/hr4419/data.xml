  <summary>4/8/2014--Introduced.
Sage-Grouse and Endangered Species Conservation and Protection Act - Amends the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to extend to five years the deadlines for determining whether there is substantial evidence in support of a petition to add or remove a species from the list of endangered or threatened species and the petition is warranted. Prohibits a petition from being considered for 10 years after either a determination is made that the petition is not warranted or a regulation to list a species is withdrawn.

Requires the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Commerce as appropriate (the Secretary) to make publicly available a cost-benefit analysis of listing the species when a petition is found to be warranted.

Prohibits the Secretary from adding to the list a species in a state in which the majority of lands are managed by the federal government, unless specified information is provided to the state.

Requires conservation measures to be conducted on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land and National Forest System lands to address the habitat and viability of: (1) endangered or threatened species, and (2) other species to alleviate the need to list a species under such Act. Establishes a program to sell certain public land parcels to generate revenues for such measures.

Requires activities on BLM or forest land parcels of 10,000 acres or less and that are related to threats to protected species to be: (1) categorically excluded from the requirements relating to environmental assessments or environmental impact statements under the National Environmental Policy Act, and (2) exempt from the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and related requirements.

Requires the Secretary to use the best scientific and economic data available in conducting the five-year reviews of the status of listed species.

Deems a designation of critical habitat that restricts the uses of land to be a regulatory taking of property.</summary>
