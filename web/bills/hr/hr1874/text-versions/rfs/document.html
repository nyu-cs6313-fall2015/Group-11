bill or resolution reported by any committee of the House of 
Representatives or the Senate (except the Committee on Appropriations 
of each House), as a supplement to estimates prepared under section 
402, a macroeconomic impact analysis of the budgetary effects of such 
bill or resolution for the ten fiscal-year period beginning with the 
first fiscal year for which an estimate was prepared under section 402 
and each of the next three ten fiscal-year periods. The Director shall 
submit to such committee the macroeconomic impact analysis, together 
with the basis for the analysis. As a supplement to estimates prepared 
under section 402, all such information so submitted shall be included 
in the report accompanying such bill or resolution.
    ``(b) Economic Impact.--The analysis prepared under subsection (a) 
shall describe the potential economic impact of the applicable major 
bill or resolution on major economic variables, including real gross 
domestic product, business investment, the capital stock, employment, 
interest rates, and labor supply. The analysis shall also describe the 
potential fiscal effects of the bill or resolution, including any 
estimates of revenue increases or decreases resulting from changes in 
gross domestic product. To the extent practicable, the analysis should 
use a variety of economic models in order to reflect the full range of 
possible economic outcomes resulting from the bill or resolution. The 
analysis (or a technical appendix to the analysis) shall specify the 
economic and econometric models used, sources of data, relevant data 
transformations, and shall include such explanation as is necessary to 
make the models comprehensible to academic and public policy analysts.
    ``(c) Reporting on Accuracy of Macroeconomic Impact Analyses.--Upon 
completion of the fifth fiscal year beginning after the date of 
enactment of any major bill or joint resolution for which the 
Congressional Budget Office prepared an analysis under subsection (a), 
the Congressional Budget Office shall report on the accuracy of the 
original macroeconomic impact analysis of such enacted bill or joint 
resolution and submit these reports to the Committees on the Budget of 
the House of Representatives and the Senate.

                proposal;
                    ``(B) an estimate of revenue feedback expected to 
                result from enactment of the proposal; and

                assumptions and the source of data underlying that 
                estimate;

        resolution if the gross budgetary effects of such bill or 
        resolution for any fiscal year in the period for which an

analysis prepared by the Joint Committee on Taxation for any provisions
