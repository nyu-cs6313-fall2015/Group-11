Budget Office shall, to the extent practicable, prepare for each major 
bill or resolution reported by any committee of the House of 
Representatives or the Senate (except the Committee on Appropriations 
of each House), as a supplement to estimates prepared under section 
402, a macroeconomic impact analysis of the budgetary effects of such 
bill or resolution for the ten fiscal-year period beginning with the 
first fiscal year for which an estimate was prepared under section 402 
and each of the next three ten fiscal-year periods. Such estimate shall 
be predicated upon the supplemental projection described in section 
202(e)(4). The Director shall submit to such committee the 
macroeconomic impact analysis, together with the basis for the 
analysis. As a supplement to estimates prepared under section 402, all 
such information so submitted shall be included in the report 
accompanying such bill or resolution.
    ``(b) Economic Impact.--The analysis prepared under subsection (a) 
shall describe the potential economic impact of the applicable major 
bill or resolution on major economic variables, including real gross 
domestic product, business investment, the capital stock, employment, 
interest rates, and labor supply. The analysis shall also describe the 
potential fiscal effects of the bill or resolution, including any 
estimates of revenue increases or decreases resulting from changes in 
gross domestic product. To the extent practicable, the analysis should 
use a variety of economic models in order to reflect the full range of 
possible economic outcomes resulting from the bill or resolution. The 
analysis (or a technical appendix to the analysis) shall specify the 
economic and econometric models used, sources of data, relevant data 
transformations, and shall include such explanation as is necessary to 
make the models comprehensible to academic and public policy analysts.

                proposal;

                result from enactment of the proposal; and

                assumptions and the source of data underlying that 
                estimate;

        resolution if the gross budgetary effects of such bill or 
        resolution for any fiscal year in the period for which an 
        estimate is prepared under section 402 is estimated to be 
        greater than .25 percent of the current projected gross 
        domestic product of the United States for any such fiscal year;
            ``(3) the term `budgetary effect', when applied to a major 
        bill or resolution, means the changes in revenues, outlays, 
        deficits, and debt resulting from that measure; and
