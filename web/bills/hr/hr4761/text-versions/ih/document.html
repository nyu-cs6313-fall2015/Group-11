                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the maximum 
  nameplate capacity of a small wind turbine qualifying for an energy 
               credit from 100 kilowatts to 20 megawatts.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Wind Energy Expansion Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Distributed wind power, commonly referred to as ``small 
        and community wind'', is the use of wind turbines that are 
        typically modest in size at homes, farms, businesses, and 
        public places to offset all or a portion of the site's energy 
        consumption.
            (2) Distributed wind power can be employed efficiently at 
        millions of sites, which means it has the potential to produce 
        very large amounts of electricity across the Nation and abroad, 
        even in the most remote or dangerous locations.
            (3) This segment of the renewable energy industry provides 
        myriad public benefits, including high levels of domestic 
        manufacturing, energy resilience and independence, and 
        thousands of small business jobs in dozens of states.
            (4) The National Renewable Energy Laboratory and others 
        have demonstrated that distributed wind power provides a strong 
        economic multiplier effect, which means greater local revenue 
        for the communities that install distributed wind turbines.
            (5) There are barriers to the market penetration of 
        distributed wind power that have nothing to do with this proven 
        technology, including inconsistent Federal policy and 
        problematic local zoning ordinances.
            (6) Harnessing the power of the wind at homes, farms, 
        schools, businesses, and on certain public lands supports 
        American small businesses, the economy, energy security, and 
        the environment.
            (7) Expanding the investment tax credit for distributed 
        wind builds on the success of the existing credit, tracks the 
        development of distributed wind technology, and is a proven and 
        efficient method of supporting this development.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO ENERGY CREDIT FOR DISTRIBUTED WIND TURBINES.

    Section 48(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to 
qualified small wind property) is amended--
            (1) by striking subparagraph (A) and inserting the 
        following new subparagraph:
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified small wind 
                energy property' means--
                            ``(i) property which uses a qualifying 
                        small wind turbine to generate electricity, or
                            ``(ii) property which uses 1 or more wind 
                        turbines with an aggregate nameplate capacity 
                        of more than 100 kilowatts but not more than 20 
                        megawatts.'', and
            (2) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D) 
        and inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new 
        subparagraph:
                    ``(C) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe 
                such regulations as may be appropriate to prevent 
                improper division of property to attempt to meet the 
                limitation under subparagraph (A)(ii).''.
