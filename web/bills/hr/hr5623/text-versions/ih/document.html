_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To establish a National Parents Corps Program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Parents Corps Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Nearly 25 percent of children in the United States ages 
        12 to 17 have used an illicit drug in their lifetime, according 
        to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration's 2012 
        National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).
            (2) The American Lung Association states, approximately 
        4,000 children under age 18 try their first cigarette and more 
        than 950 of them will become new, regular daily smokers. 
        Moreover, according to NSDUH, among children ages 12 to 17 who 
        smoked cigarettes in the last month, 54.6 percent also used an 
        illicit drug.
            (3) The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids says parents have 
        more influence over their children than friends, music, TV, the 
        Internet, and celebrities. It adds, children whose parents 
        teach them about drug risks are significantly less likely to 
        use drugs.
            (4) In response to concerns about youth violence and drug, 
        tobacco, and alcohol use by youth, the White House unveiled the 
        Parents Corps in 2003. It was initially a 3-year initiative 
        operating in 9 States to bring together citizenship, service, 
        and responsibility to empower parents to keep their children, 
        schools, and communities drug-free.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL PARENTS CORPS PROGRAM.

    (a) Grant To Establish the Program.--Subject to the availability of 
appropriations to carry out this Act, the Administrator shall, not 
later than 3 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, award 
a grant to an eligible nonprofit entity to establish a National Parents 
Corps Program (referred to in this Act as the ``Program'') to promote 
safety, combat youth violence, and combat drug and alcohol abuse in 
schools in the United States. The eligible nonprofit entity awarded 
such grant shall be known as the ``NPCP Nonprofit Partner''.
    (b) Program Activities.--The NPCP Nonprofit Partner shall use the 
grant awarded under this section to establish and administer the 
Program, which shall include--
            (1) employing Parent Leaders to carry out the Program at 
        eligible schools that are selected to host Parent Leaders, in 
        accordance with sections 4 and 5; and
            (2) working with schools, parents of children enrolled in 
        schools, local nonprofit organizations, and law enforcement 
        agencies and officers to promote safety, combat youth violence, 
        and combat drug, alcohol, and tobacco abuse in schools.

SEC. 4. PARTICIPATION OF SCHOOLS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of 
enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the NPCP Nonprofit 
Partner shall solicit applications from eligible schools desiring to 
participate in the Program by hosting a Parent Leader. Each eligible 
school selected to host a Parent Leader shall enter into a memorandum 
of understanding with the NPCP Nonprofit Partner--
            (1) in which the eligible school agrees to participate in 
        the Program and host a Parent Leader for the number of years 
        that is equal to the number of grade levels taught at the 
        school; and
            (2) that outlines the parameters and goals of hosting a 
        Parent Leader and carrying out the Program at the eligible 
        school, including how the Parent Leader and the operation of 
        the Program will address the cultural, social, and crime 
        prevention needs and goals of the students at such school.
    (b) Selection Considerations.--In selecting eligible schools to 
host Parent Leaders under this Act, the NPCP Nonprofit Partner shall 
ensure that, to the extent practicable, the eligible schools selected 
represent schools--
            (1) that are located in a variety of geographical regions 
        in the United States;
            (2) in urban, rural, and suburban areas; and
            (3) in ethnically and economically diverse communities.

SEC. 5. PARENT LEADERS.

    (a) Parent Leader for Each School.--For each eligible school 
selected to participate in the Program as a host school under section 
4, the NPCP Nonprofit Partner shall, after consultation with the 
principal of the selected school, solicit applications for, hire, and

        and adolescents to initiate the use of drugs, alcohol, and 
        tobacco;
            (2) create a delivery system to provide parents of students

        alcohol, and tobacco use and abuse, gang activity, and 
        violence;
            (3) work with school officials, other parents of students
