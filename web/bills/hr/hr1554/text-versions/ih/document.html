administrative proceeding to determine or collect tax, there shall be a 
rebuttable presumption that a United States person (other than an 
entity with shares regularly traded on an established securities 
market) who, directly or indirectly, formed, transferred assets to, was 
a beneficiary of, had a beneficial interest in, or received money or 
property or the use thereof from an entity, including a trust,

this section may be rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence, 
including detailed documentary, testimonial, and transactional 
evidence, establishing that--
            ``(1) in subsection (a), such taxpayer exercised no 
        control, directly or indirectly, over account or entity at the 
        time in question, and
            ``(2) in subsection (b), such amounts or things of value 
        did not represent income related to such United States person.
Any court having jurisdiction of a civil proceeding in which control of 
such an offshore account or offshore entity or the income character of 
such receipts or amounts transferred is an issue shall prohibit the 
introduction by the taxpayer of any foreign based document that is not 
authenticated in open court by a person with knowledge of such 
document, or any other evidence supplied by a person outside the

Ownership.--
            ``(1) Control.--For purposes of any civil judicial or 
        administrative proceeding under this title, there shall be a 
        rebuttable presumption that a United States person (other than 
        an entity with shares regularly traded on an established 
        securities market) who, directly or indirectly, formed, 
        transferred assets to, was a beneficiary of, had a beneficial 
        interest in, or received money or property or the use thereof 
        from an entity, including a trust, corporation, limited 
        liability company, partnership, or foundation (other than an 
        entity with shares regularly traded on an established 
        securities market), that holds an account, or in any other 
        manner has assets, in a non-FATCA institution (as defined in 
        section 7701(a)(51) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), 
        exercised control over such entity. The presumption of control 
        created by this paragraph shall not be applied to prevent the 
        Commission from determining or arguing the absence of control.
            ``(2) Beneficial ownership.--For purposes of any civil 
        judicial or administrative proceeding under this title, there 
        shall be a rebuttable presumption that securities that are 
        nominally owned by an entity, including a trust, corporation, 
        limited liability company, partnership, or foundation (other 
        than an entity with shares regularly traded on an established 
        securities market), and that are held in a non-FATCA 
        institution (as so defined), are beneficially owned by any 
        United States person (other than an entity with shares 
        regularly traded on an established securities market) who 
        directly or indirectly exercised control over such entity. The 
        presumption of beneficial ownership created by this paragraph 
        shall not be applied to prevent the Commission from determining 
        or arguing the absence of beneficial ownership.''.
            (4) Presumption for reporting purposes relating to foreign 
        financial accounts.--Section 5314 of title 31, United States 
        Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
        subsection:
    ``(d) Rebuttable Presumption.--For purposes of this section, there 
shall be a rebuttable presumption that any account with a non-FATCA 
institution (as defined in section 7701(a)(51) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986) contains funds in an amount that is at least sufficient 
to require a report prescribed by regulations under this section.''.

        the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the 
        Treasury and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange 
        Commission shall each adopt regulations or other guidance 
        necessary to implement the amendments made by this subsection. 
        The Secretary and the Chairman may by regulation or guidance 
        provide that the presumption of control shall not extend to 
        particular classes of transactions, such as corporate 
        reorganizations or transactions below a specified dollar 
        threshold, if either determines that applying such amendments 
        to such transactions is not necessary to carry out the purposes 
        of such amendments.
    (h) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect on the date which is 180 days after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, whether or not regulations are issued under subsection
