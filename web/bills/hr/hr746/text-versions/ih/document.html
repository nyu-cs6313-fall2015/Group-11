        the business, provide notice to the business that, if the 
        business is a small business as defined in subsection (k), the 
        small business may be subject to a sanction at the end of the 
        grace period described in paragraph (3);
            ``(2) delay any further action for a period of 15 calendar 
        days;

        the violation or other conduct giving rise to the sanction;

        of that period;
            ``(5) if the determination under paragraph (4) is that the 
        small business would not be subject to the sanction, waive the 
        sanction; and
            ``(6) if notice is given more than 10 business days after 
        the date on which the agency determines that a sanction may be 
        imposed on the business, and the agency determines that the 
        same sanction may have been imposed on the business 10 business 
        days prior to the date of the notice, that date of notice shall 
        be the effective date commencing the grace period described in

                in the preceding calendar year;

                $10,000,000 in the preceding year.
            ``(2) the term `Ombudsman' has the same meaning given such
