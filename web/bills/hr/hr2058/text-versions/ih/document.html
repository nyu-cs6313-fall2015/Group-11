_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To improve and enhance research and programs on childhood cancer 
                 survivorship, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Childhood Cancer Survivors' Quality 
of Life Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) An estimated 13,500 children and adolescents under age 
        20 are diagnosed with cancer each year.
            (2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer 
        survived more than 5 years, but today, cure rates have 
        increased to over 80 percent for children and adolescents under 
        age 20.
            (3) The population of survivors of childhood cancers has 
        grown dramatically, to over 360,000 individuals of all ages as 
        of 2012.
            (4) As many as two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors are 
        likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment, 
        with as many as one-fourth experiencing a late effect that is 
        serious or life-threatening. The most common late effects of 
        childhood cancer are neurocognitive, psychological, 
        cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects and 
        secondary malignancies.
            (5) As a result of disparities in the delivery of cancer 
        care, minority, low-income, and other medically underserved 
        children are more likely to be diagnosed with late stage 
        disease, experience poorer treatment outcomes, have shorter 
        survival time with less quality of life, and experience a 
        substantially greater likelihood of cancer death.
            (6) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as 
        therapies evolve, which means that the monitoring and care of 
        cancer survivors may need to be modified on a routine basis.
            (7) Despite the intense stress caused by childhood cancer, 
        there is a lack of standardized and coordinated psychosocial 
        care for the children and their families, from the date of 
        diagnosis through treatment and survivorship.
            (8) The Institute of Medicine, in its report on cancer 
        survivorship entitled ``Childhood Cancer Survivorship: 
        Improving Care and Quality of Life'', states that an organized 
        system of care and a method of care for pediatric cancer 
        survivors is needed.
            (9) Focused and well-designed research and pilot health 
        delivery programs can answer questions about the optimal ways 
        to provide health care, follow-up monitoring services, and 
        survivorship care to those diagnosed with childhood cancer and 
        contribute to improvements in the quality of care and quality 
        of life of those individuals.
