Requires implementation of such programs by the earlier of: (1) five years after enactment of this Act, or (2) the date on which the backlog is eliminated.\n\nRequires agency programs to integrate information from government, publicly available, and commercial data sources, consumer reporting agencies, and social media. Permits information obtained from such sources to include: (1) security or counterintelligence information on any public online website that may suggest ill intent, vulnerability to blackmail, compulsive behavior, allegiance to another country, illegal drug use, criminal activity, material falsification, change in ideology, or a lack of good judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and (2) data maintained on any terrorist or criminal watch list maintained by any agency, state or local government, or international organization.\n\nRequires automated record checks at least twice every five years to ensure continued eligibility of individuals employed or contracted with by such agencies.\n\nDirects the DNI to issue guidance defining minor financial or mental health issues.\n\nRequires inspectors general of such agencies to assess the effectiveness and fairness of agency programs."
