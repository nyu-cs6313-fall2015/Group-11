  <summary>1/7/2014--Introduced.
Risk Management Certainty Act - Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to revise the de minimis exemption from designation as a swap dealer. Specifies the de minimus quantity of swap dealing as at least $8 billion.

(The Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] is required to exempt from designation as a swap dealer any entity that engages in de minimis quantity of swap dealing in connection with transactions with or on behalf of its customers.)

Directs the CFTC to include, among the factors used in determining swap dealer exemptions, any monetary or other levels it has established. Prescribes affirmative CFTC action, either by rule or by regulation, as a prerequisite to changing or amending such levels.</summary>
