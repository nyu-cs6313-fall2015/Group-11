     To direct the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of 
 Agriculture to sell certain Federal land, to direct that the proceeds 
of such sales be applied to reduce the Federal budget deficit, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Land Act''.

SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO SELL LAND.

    (a) Authorization.--For each of fiscal years 2013 through 2017, 
subject to valid existing rights, the Secretary of the Interior or the 
Secretary of Agriculture, as the case may be, shall offer for 
competitive sale by auction all right, title, and interest, to the 
extent provided in subsection (b)(2), in and to the following:
            (1) Eight percent of the Federal land managed by the Bureau 
        of Land Management.
            (2) Eight percent of the National Forest System land.
    (b) Terms and Conditions.--
            (1) Configuration of land.--The Secretary concerned shall 
        configure the land to be sold to maximize marketability or 
        achieve management objectives, and may prescribe such terms and 
        conditions on the land sales authorized by this Act as the 
        Secretary deems in the public interest.
            (2) Mineral rights.--For each fiscal year, the Secretary 
        concerned may include in the sale of land under subsection (a) 
        the mineral rights to such land for not more than 50 percent of 
        the total acreage sold under subsection (a) by that Secretary, 
        if the Secretary determines that such inclusion is likely to 
        maximize marketability.

SEC. 3. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF LAND.

    All proceeds from the sale of land under this Act shall be 
deposited into the Treasury and applied--
            (1) to reduce the annual Federal budget deficit for the 
        fiscal year in which the sums are received, except as provided 
        in paragraph (2); and
            (2) if there is no annual Federal budget deficit for the 
        fiscal year in which the sums are received, to reduce the 
        outstanding Federal debt.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
