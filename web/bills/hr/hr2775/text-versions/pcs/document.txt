                                 AN ACT


 
To condition the provision of premium and cost-sharing subsidies under 
  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act upon a certification 
that a program to verify household income and other qualifications for 
         such subsidies is operational, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No Subsidies Without Verification 
Act''.

SEC. 2. CONDITIONING PROVISION OF ACA PREMIUM AND COST-SHARING 
              SUBSIDIES UPON CERTIFICATION THAT A PROGRAM TO VERIFY 
              HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND OTHER QUALIFICATIONS FOR THOSE 
              SUBSIDIES IS OPERATIONAL.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no premium tax credits 
shall be allowed under section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
and no reductions in cost-sharing shall be allowed under section 1402 
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18071) 
before the date that the Inspector General of the Department of Health 
and Human Services certifies to the Congress that there is in place a 
program that successfully and consistently verifies, consistent with 
section 1411 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 18081), the household income and 
coverage requirements of individuals applying for such credits and 
cost-sharing reductions prior to making the benefits available.

            Passed the House of Representatives September 12, 2013.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,
