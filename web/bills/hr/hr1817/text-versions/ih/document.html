 To require certain Federal agencies to use iron and steel produced in 
   the United States in carrying out projects for the construction, 
  alteration, or repair of a public building or public work, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Steel First Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. USE OF IRON AND STEEL PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE 
              CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC WORKS.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
head of a covered Federal agency may not obligate or expend funds 
appropriated to the agency, or provide financial assistance using funds 
appropriated to the agency, for a project for the construction, 
alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work 
unless all of the iron and steel used in the project is produced in the 
United States.
    (b) Exceptions.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply 
to a covered Federal agency in any case in which the head of the agency 
finds that--
            (1) their application would be inconsistent with the public 
        interest;
            (2) iron and steel are not produced in the United States in 
        sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a 
        satisfactory quality; or
            (3) inclusion of iron and steel produced in the United 
        States will increase the cost of the overall project contract 
        by more than 25 percent.
    (c) Written Justification for Waiver.--
            (1) Notice and comment.--If the head of a covered Federal 
        agency determines that it is necessary to waive the application 
        of subsection (a) based on a finding under subsection (b), the 
        head of the agency shall, before the waiver becomes effective--
                    (A) publish in the Federal Register a detailed 
                written justification as to why the waiver is needed; 
                and
                    (B) provide the public with a reasonable period of 
                time for notice and comment.
            (2) Annual report.--Not later than one year after the date 
        of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the head of 
        a covered Federal agency shall submit to Congress a report on--
                    (A) any waivers granted by the head of the agency 
                under subsection (b) in the preceding year, including 
                justifications for the waivers; and
                    (B) any obligation or expenditure of funds by the 
                head of the agency in the preceding year that did not 
                conform to the requirements of this section due to 
                limitations imposed by a treaty, agreement, or other 
                provision of law.
    (d) Relationship to State Requirements.--The head of a covered 
Federal agency shall not impose any limitation or condition on 
financial assistance provided using funds appropriated to the agency 
that restricts any State from imposing more stringent requirements than 
this section on the use of iron and steel in foreign countries in 
projects carried out with such assistance or restricts any recipient of 
such assistance from complying with such State imposed requirements.
    (e) Intentional Violations.--If it has been determined by a court 
or Federal agency that any person intentionally--
            (1) affixed a label bearing a ``Made in America'' 
        inscription, or any inscription with the same meaning, to any 
        product used in projects to which this section applies, sold in 
        or shipped to the United States that was not made in the United 
        States; or
            (2) represented that any product used in projects to which 
        this section applies, sold in or shipped to the United States 
        that was not produced in the United States, was produced in the 
        United States;
that person shall be ineligible, for a period of 6 years beginning on 
the date of the determination, to receive any contract or subcontract 
made with funds authorized to be appropriated to the agency pursuant to 
the debarment, suspension, and ineligibility procedures in subpart 9.4 
of chapter 1 of title 48, Code of Federal Regulations.
    (f) Limitation on Applicability of Waivers to Products Produced in 
Certain Foreign Countries.--If the head of a covered Federal agency, in 
consultation with the United States Trade Representative, determines 
that--
            (1) a foreign country is a party to an agreement with the 
        United States and pursuant to that agreement the head of an 
        agency of the United States has waived the requirements of this 
        section; and
            (2) the foreign country has violated the terms of the 
        agreement by discriminating against products covered by this 
        section that are produced in the United States and are covered 
        by the agreement,
the provisions of subsection (b) shall not apply with respect to the 
head of the covered Federal agency in connection with products produced 
in that foreign country.
    (g) Relationship to Transportation Provisions.--Notwithstanding any 
provision of this section, the requirements contained in section 313 of 
title 23, United States Code, and sections 5323(j) and 50101 of title 
49, United States Code, as amended by this Act, shall continue to 
apply.
    (h) Application of Requirements to Entire Project.--The requirement 
of subsection (a) and the exceptions specified in subsection (b) apply 
to the total of obligations and expenditures for an entire project and 
not only to obligations and expenditures for component parts of such 
project.
    (i) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:
            (1) Covered federal agency.--The term ``covered Federal 
        agency'' means the Department of Homeland Security, the
