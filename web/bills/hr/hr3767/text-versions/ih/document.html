the victim has a right to be heard. A victim has a right to be heard 
when specified in the Manual for Courts Martial, but, at a minimum, the 
victim has a right to be heard regarding the privilege described in 
subsection (d).
    ``(2) In this subsection, the term `Special Victims' Counsel' means 
an attorney who has formed an attorney-client relationship with an 
alleged victim of an offense covered by section 920 or 925 of this 
title (article 120 or 125) or of an attempt to commit such an offense, 
as punishable under section 880 of this title (article 80).
    ``(d) An alleged victim of an offense described in subsection 
(c)(2) may not be questioned about any sexual behavior on the part of 
the alleged victim that is not directly related to the charge or 
specification being investigated under this section (article). No 
evidence may be admitted at the investigation for the purpose of 
proving or showing a sexual predisposition on the part of the alleged 
victim.''.
