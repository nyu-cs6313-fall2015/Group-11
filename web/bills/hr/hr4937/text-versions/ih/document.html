Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS OF WASTEFUL AND EXCESSIVE SPENDING 
              REQUIRED.

    (a) Implementation of Report Recommendations Required.--With 
respect to each of fiscal years 2014 through 2020 and except as 
provided in subsection (b), not later than 4 years after the submission 
of a report regarding wasteful and excessive spending, or duplicative 
programs causing wasteful and excessive spending, by an inspector 
general of an agency (in this Act, referred to as the ``IG report''), 
the head of the agency shall implement all of the recommendations in 
such report.
    (b) Exception.--The implementation requirement in subsection (a) 
shall not apply to a recommendation by an inspector general that would 
violate an existing law. With regard to any such recommendation, the 
head of the relevant agency shall submit to Congress a description of 
the necessary change to the law to legally implement the 
recommendation.
    (c) Report Required.--
            (1) Initial report.--Not later than 6 months after the 
        submission of an IG report, or 6 months after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, whichever is later, the head of the 
        relevant agency shall submit to Congress a report on--
                    (A) the progress of the implementation of each 
                recommendation in the IG report;
                    (B) the time period required to complete each such 
                implementation;
                    (C) the wasteful and excessive spending, and 
                duplicative programs causing wasteful and excessive 
                spending within each agency described in the IG report;
                    (D) the savings created from the completion of 
                implementing each recommendation; and
                    (E) the reason each recommendation was not 
                implemented before the submission of the IG report.
            (2) Subsequent reports.--Not later than 13 months, and 
        yearly thereafter until an updated report is submitted for 
        fiscal year 2020, after the submission of an IG report, the 
        head of the relevant agency shall submit to Congress an updated 
        report on the information described in subparagraphs (A)
