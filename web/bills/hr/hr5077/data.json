    "text": "Coal Jobs Protection Act of 2014 - Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) to revise the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a state acting pursuant to an equivalent approved state program (permitting authority) to base a determination on approving a new or renewed permit covering discharges from a point source only on compliance with regulations issued by the permitting authority. Prohibits the permitting authority from basing a determination on the extent of the permit applicant's adherence to guidance issued by the EPA.\n\nAuthorizes an applicant, if the permitting authority does not approve or deny a substantially complete application for a new permit within 270 days after the date of receipt of an application, to discharge as if the application were approved.\n\nRevises requirements for the administration of state permit programs, including by making optional a statement by an attorney general or chief legal officer that state laws or an interstate compact provide adequate authority to conduct the program.\n\n Establishes deadlines for environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) for approval of permits to discharge dredged or fill material into navigable waters.\n\nRequires a state to concur with the EPA's determination that a discharge will result in an unacceptable adverse effect in order for the EPA to deny or restrict the specification of any defined area as a disposal site or the use of defined areas as disposal sites.\n\nRequires the EPA, before issuing a regulation, policy statement, guidance, response to a petition, or other requirement, or implementing a new or substantially altered program under the Clean Water Act, to analyze the impact of such action on employment levels or economic activity in each state.\n\nAuthorizes states to disregard, accept, or modify the EPA's disagreement with, and recommendations for, a state's identification of: (1) waters as areas with insufficient controls, and (2) pollutants suitable for maximum daily load measurement.\n\nExempts trash and garbage from requirements governing the discharge of fill material into waters of the United States."
