activities that are conducted voluntarily and initiated by participants 
in a program or activity carried out by such recipient.

            (1) to sponsor a religious activity;
            (2) to prohibit a recipient of Federal financial assistance 
        from ensuring that a religious activity does not materially and 
        substantially interfere with the orderly conduct of the program 
        or activities carried out by such recipient;
            (3) to require any person to participate in prayer or other 
        religious activity; or
            (4) to compel any employee or agent of a program or 
        activity that is carried out by a recipient of Federal 
        financial assistance to participate in an activity if the 
        content of the speech at the activity is contrary to the 
        beliefs of the employee or agent.
