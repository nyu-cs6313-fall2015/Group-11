  <summary>1/15/2014--Introduced.
Ensuring Full Use of Federal Health Care Funding Act of 2014 - Amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to recoup any funds awarded to a state to establish health care exchanges to the extent the state has not obligated them for expenditure before April 1, 2014. Allows the Secretary, however, not to recoup such funds from a state if the state has approved, before March 31, 2014, a plan to spend them for such exchanges in a timely manner.

Requires the Secretary to use any recouped funds to make grants to qualified entities to: (1) build and fund operations of an in-person assistance personnel (IPA) program (also known as "non-Navigator assistance personnel"); (2) coordinate with other health and human services organizations in the state to broaden outreach to individuals eligible to enroll in qualified health plans through the exchange operating in the state; and (3) produce and disseminate marketing and campaign materials, subject to the Secretary's approval.

Requires a qualified entity to: (1) have (or readily and on a timely basis be able to establish) relationships with employers and employees, consumers (both uninsured and underinsured), or self-employed individuals in the state that are likely to be qualified to enroll in coverage options made available through a health care exchange in the state; (2) be capable of carrying out grant activities; and (3) meet specified standards.

Lists as types of qualified entities: (1) a trade, industry, and professional association; (2) a commercial fishing industry organization; (3) a ranching and farming organization; (4) a community and consumer-focused nonprofit group; (5) a chamber of commerce; (6) a union; (7) a resource partner of the Small Business Administration (SBA); (8) a licensed insurance agent or broker; and (9) any other entity that meets the qualification standards.</summary>
