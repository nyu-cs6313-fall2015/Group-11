                                 A BILL


 
   To prohibit the sale or transport of equines and equine parts in 
         interstate or foreign commerce for human consumption.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Safeguard American Food Exports Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) horses and other equines are domestic animals that are 
        used primarily for recreation, pleasure, and sport;
            (2) unlike cows, pigs, and other domesticated species, 
        horses and other members of the equidae family are not raised 
        for the purpose of human consumption;
            (3) equines raised in the United States are frequently 
        treated with drugs, including phenylbutazone, acepromazine, 
        boldenone undecylenate, omeprazole, ketoprofen, xylazine, 
        hyaluronic acid, nitrofurazone, polysulfated glycosaminoglycan, 
        clenbuterol, tolazoline, and ponazuril, which are not approved 
        for use in horses intended for human consumption;
            (4) consuming parts of an equine raised in the United 
        States likely poses a serious threat to human health and the 
        public should be protected from these unsafe products; and
            (5) the sale and transport of equines for the purpose of 
        processing for human consumption, and the sale and transport of 
        equine parts for human consumption, are economic in nature and 
        substantially affect interstate and foreign commerce.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS.

    Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
331) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(ccc)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the sale or 
transport of equines in interstate commerce, or the importing or 
exporting (or offering for import or export) of equines into or out of 
the United States, by any person who knows or reasonably should have 
known that such equines are to be slaughtered for human consumption as 
food.
    ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the sale or 
transport of equine parts (including flesh, meat, and viscera) in 
interstate commerce, or the importing or exporting (or offering for 
import or export) of such parts into or out of the United States, by 
any person who knows or reasonably should have known that such equine 
parts are to be used for human consumption as food.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
