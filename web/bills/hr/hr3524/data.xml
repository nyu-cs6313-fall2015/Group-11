  <summary>11/18/2013--Introduced.
Economic Recovery On-the-Job Training Act of 2013 - Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to require the Secretary of Labor to make discretionary grants to state and local boards for adult on-the-job training or dislocated worker on-the-job training programs within economically disadvantaged areas and extremely economically disadvantaged areas. Requires the Secretary to ensure that state and local boards within extremely economically disadvantaged areas receive 25% more authorized grant funds than those within economically disadvantaged areas.

Defines "economically disadvantaged area" to mean any area for which there is a single five-digit postal zip code, and which includes any portion of a census tract where the median annual household income is less than $40,000 per year. Defines "extremely economically disadvantaged area" similarly, except for a median annual household income of less than $32,000 per year.</summary>
