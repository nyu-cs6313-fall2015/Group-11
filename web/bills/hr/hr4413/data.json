and (2) ensure that certain swap transaction information is publicly available no sooner than 30 days after the swap transaction has been executed, or at a later date appropriate to protect the identity of participants and positions in illiquid markets and to prevent the elimination or reduction of market liquidity.\n\nDefines \"illiquid market\" as any market in which the volume and frequency of trading in swaps is at such a level as to allow identification of individual market participants.\n\n(Sec. 353) Sets forth recordkeeping requirements for a member of a designated contract market or a swap execution facility that is neither registered with the CFTC nor required to be registered.\n\n(Sec. 354) Excludes from the definition of \u201cswap\u201d any purchase or sale of a nonfinancial commodity or security for deferred shipment or delivery, so long as the transaction is intended to be physically settled (as under current law), including any stand-alone or embedded option: (1) for which exercise results in a physical delivery obligation, (2) which cannot be severed or marketed separately from the overall transaction for the purpose of financial settlement, and (3) in which both parties are commercial market participants.\n\n (Sec. 355) Requires a new affirmative CFTC rule or regulation in order to amend or reduce the de minimis quantity of swap dealing that is currently set at $8 billion.\n\n (Sec. 356) Directs the CFTC, in consultation with the prudential regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), to the extent that swap dealers and major swap participants that are banks are permitted to use approved financial models to calculate minimum capital requirements (including minimum initial and variation margin requirements and non-cash collateral) to permit the use of comparable financial models by swap dealers and major swap participants that are not banks.\n\nAmends the Act to require the SEC, in consultation with the CFTC, to do the same with respect to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants.\n\n (Sec. 357) Directs the CFTC to revise regulations regarding criteria that qualify certain registered commodity pool operators for exemption from requirements for specified risk disclosures, performance disclosures, periodic reporting, annual reporting, and recordkeeping.\n\nAlters one criterion for qualification for such exemptions currently granted to: (1) registered commodity pool operators who sell participations in a pool solely to qualified eligible persons in an offering which qualifies for exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and (2) certain banks registered as commodity pool operators in connection with a pool that is a collective trust fund whose securities are exempt from registration under the Securities Act.\n\n (Sec. 358) Authorizes the CFTC to define a bona fide hedging transaction, consistent with certain CEA requirements.\n\n (Sec. 359) Directs the SEC and the CFTC jointly to issue rules setting forth the application of United States swaps requirements for cross-border swaps and security-based swaps transactions involving U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons.\n\n(Sec. 360) Directs the CFTC to report to certain congressional committees on the standards and rules of foreign boards of trade with respect to the physical delivery of base metals, including warehousing facilities, as compared to the standards and rules for domestic designated contract markets and related warehouses for base metals.\n\n(Sec. 361) Excludes from the definition of \"commodity pool operator\" a person who serves as an investment adviser to a registered investment company (or its subsidiary) that invests, reinvests, owns, holds, or trades in commodity interests limited to only financial commodity interests.\n\nExcludes from the definition of \"commodity trading advisor\" a person who serves as an investment adviser to a registered investment company or its subsidiary, if the commodity trading advice relates only to a financial commodity interest.\n\nDefines \"financial commodity interest\" as a futures contract, an option on a futures contract, or a swap involving a commodity that is not an exempt commodity or an agricultural commodity, including any index of financial commodity interests, whether cash settled or involving physical delivery.\n\nSubtitle F: Effective Date - (Sec. 371) Makes enactment of this Act retroactive to July 21, 2010 (the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act)."
