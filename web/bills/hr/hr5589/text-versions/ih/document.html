_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To direct the Secretary of Education to establish a grant program to 
 assist institutions of higher education in establishing, maintaining, 
                 and improving veteran student centers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran Education Empowerment Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Over 1,000,000 veterans attended institutions of higher 
        education in 2012.
            (2) Veterans face unique hardships in transitioning from 
        the battlefield to the classroom and eventually to the 
        workforce.
            (3) The National Endowment for the Humanities' Warrior-
        Scholar Project found that ``veterans transitioning to college 
        likely have not used academic skills since high school and have 
        difficulty adjusting to a fundamentally different social and 
        cultural environment, [leading] to veterans dropping out of 
        college before earning their degree''.
            (4) The National Education Association found that veteran 
        students can feel lonely and vulnerable on campus and that 
        ``connecting student veterans can effectively ease this 
        isolation'' by bringing together new veteran students with 
        those who have already successfully navigated the first few 
        semesters of college.
            (5) The unemployment rate for post--9/11 veterans far 
        outpaces both the overall non-veteran unemployment rate and the 
        unemployment rate for non-veterans entering the workforce for 
        the first time.
            (6) According to Mission United--a United Way program that 
        helps veterans re-acclimate to civilian life--it is often 
        ``essential'' for veteran students to be mentored by ``another 
        veteran who understands their mindset and experience''.
            (7) Veteran student centers are recognized as an 
        institutional best practice by the Student Veterans of America.
            (8) The American Council on Education, which represents 
        more than 1,700 institutions of higher education across the 
        country, has called having a dedicated space for veterans on 
        campus ``a promising way for colleges and universities to 
        better serve veterans on campus'' and a ``critical'' component 
        of many colleges' efforts to serve their veteran students.
            (9) Budget constraints often make it difficult or 
        impossible for institutions of higher education to dedicate 
        space to veteran offices, lounges, or student centers.
            (10) The 110th Congress authorized the funding of veteran 
        student centers through the Centers of Excellence for Veteran 
        Student Success under part T of title VIII of the Higher 
        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1161t).
            (11) According to the Department of Education, federally 
        funded veteran student centers and staff have generated 
        improved recruitment, retention, and graduation rates, have 
        helped veteran students feel better connected across campus, 
        and have directly contributed to student veterans' successful 
        academic outcomes.

SEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN, AND IMPROVE VETERAN 
              STUDENT CENTERS.
