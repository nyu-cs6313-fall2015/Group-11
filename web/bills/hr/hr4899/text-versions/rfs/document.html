    Section 18(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 
1344(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(5)(A) In each oil and gas leasing program under this 
        section, the Secretary shall make available for leasing and 
        conduct lease sales including at least 50 percent of the 
        available unleased acreage within each outer Continental Shelf 
        planning area considered to have the largest undiscovered, 
        technically recoverable oil and gas resources (on a total btu 
        basis) based upon the most recent national geologic assessment 
        of the outer Continental Shelf, with an emphasis on offering 
        the most geologically prospective parts of the planning area.
            ``(B) The Secretary shall include in each proposed oil and 
        gas leasing program under this section any State subdivision of 
        an outer Continental Shelf planning area that the Governor of 
        the State that represents that subdivision requests be made 
        available for leasing. The Secretary may not remove such a 
        subdivision from the program until publication of the final 
        program, and shall include and consider all such subdivisions 
        in any environmental review conducted and statement prepared 
        for such program under section 102(2) of the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)).
            ``(C) In this paragraph the term `available unleased 
        acreage' means that portion of the outer Continental Shelf that 
        is not under lease at the time of a proposed lease sale, and 
        that has not otherwise been made unavailable for leasing by 
        law.
            ``(6)(A) In the 5-year oil and gas leasing program, the 
        Secretary shall make available for leasing any outer 
        Continental Shelf planning areas that--
                    ``(i) are estimated to contain more than 
                2,500,000,000 barrels of oil; or
                    ``(ii) are estimated to contain more than 
                7,500,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas.
            ``(B) To determine the planning areas described in 
        subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall use the document entitled 
        `Minerals Management Service Assessment of Undiscovered 
        Technically Recoverable Oil and Gas Resources of the Nation's 
        Outer Continental Shelf, 2006'.''.

SEC. 10102. DOMESTIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION GOAL.

    Section 18(b) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 
1344(b)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(b) Domestic Oil and Natural Gas Production Goal.---
            ``(1) In general.--In developing a 5-year oil and gas 
        leasing program, and subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary 
        shall determine a domestic strategic production goal for the 
        development of oil and natural gas as a result of that program. 
        Such goal shall be--
                    ``(A) the best estimate of the possible increase in 
                domestic production of oil and natural gas from the 
                outer Continental Shelf;
                    ``(B) focused on meeting domestic demand for oil 
                and natural gas and reducing the dependence of the 
                United States on foreign energy; and
                    ``(C) focused on the production increases achieved 
                by the leasing program at the end of the 15-year period 
                beginning on the effective date of the program.
            ``(2) Program goal.--For purposes of the 5-year oil and gas 
        leasing program, the production goal referred to in paragraph 
        (1) shall be an increase by 2032 of--
                    ``(A) no less than 3,000,000 barrels in the amount 
                of oil produced per day; and
                    ``(B) no less than 10,000,000,000 cubic feet in the 
                amount of natural gas produced per day.
            ``(3) Reporting.--The Secretary shall report annually, 
        beginning at the end of the 5-year period for which the program 
        applies, to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural 
        Resources of the Senate on the progress of the program in 
        meeting the production goal. The Secretary shall identify in 
        the report projections for production and any problems with 
        leasing, permitting, or production that will prevent meeting 
        the goal.''.

        1344) for the 5-year period beginning on such date and ending 
        July 15, 2021; and
            (2) by not later than July 15, 2016, approve a final oil 
        and gas leasing program under such section for such period.
    (b) Consideration of All Areas.--In preparing such program the

        under such a lease, except that the term does not include any 
        disputes between the parties to a lease regarding the 
        obligations under such lease, including regarding any alleged 
        breach of the lease.

SEC. 21142. EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR CERTAIN CIVIL ACTIONS RELATING TO

        Quadrennial Federal Onshore Energy Production Strategy. This 
        Strategy shall direct Federal land energy development and 
        department resource allocation in order to promote the energy 
        and national security of the United States in accordance with 
        Bureau of Land Management's mission of promoting the multiple 
        use of Federal lands as set forth in the Federal Land Policy

        consult with the Administrator of the Energy Information 
        Administration on the projected energy demands of the United

objectives unless the President determines that it is not in the 
national security and economic interests of the United States to 
increase Federal domestic energy production and to further decrease 
dependence upon foreign sources of energy. In administering this

siting, or production that will prevent meeting the goal. In addition, 
the Secretary shall make suggestions to help meet any shortfalls in 
meeting the production goals.
