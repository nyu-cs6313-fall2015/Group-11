SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness in International Taxation 
Act''.

SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON TREATY BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN DEDUCTIBLE PAYMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Section 894 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
(relating to income affected by treaty) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new subsection:
    ``(d) Limitation on Treaty Benefits for Certain Deductible 
Payments.--
            ``(1) In general.--In the case of any deductible related-
        party payment, any withholding tax imposed under chapter 3 (and 
        any tax imposed under subpart A or B of this part) with respect 
        to such payment may not be reduced under any treaty of the 
        United States unless any such withholding tax would be reduced 
        under a treaty of the United States if such payment were made 
        directly to the foreign parent corporation.
            ``(2) Deductible related-party payment.--For purposes of 
        this subsection, the term `deductible related-party payment' 
        means any payment made, directly or indirectly, by any person 
        to any other person if the payment is allowable as a deduction 
        under this chapter and both persons are members of the same 
        foreign controlled group of entities.
            ``(3) Foreign controlled group of entities.--For purposes 
        of this subsection--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `foreign controlled 
                group of entities' means a controlled group of entities 
                the common parent of which is a foreign corporation.
                    ``(B) Controlled group of entities.--The term 
                `controlled group of entities' means a controlled group 
                of corporations as defined in section 1563(a)(1), 
                except that--
                            ``(i) `more than 50 percent' shall be 
                        substituted for `at least 80 percent' each 
                        place it appears therein, and
                            ``(ii) the determination shall be made 
                        without regard to subsections (a)(4) and (b)(2) 
                        of section 1563.
                A partnership or any other entity (other than a 
                corporation) shall be treated as a member of a 
                controlled group of entities if such entity is 
                controlled (within the meaning of section 954(d)(3)) by 
                members of such group (including any entity treated as 
                a member of such group by reason of this sentence).
            ``(4) Foreign parent corporation.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `foreign parent corporation' means, with 
        respect to any deductible related-party payment, the common 
        parent of the foreign controlled group of entities referred to 
        in paragraph (3)(A).
            ``(5) Regulations.--The Secretary may prescribe such 
        regulations or other guidance as are necessary or appropriate 
        to carry out the purposes of this subsection, including 
        regulations or other guidance which provide for--
                    ``(A) the treatment of two or more persons as 
                members of a foreign controlled group of entities if 
                such persons would be the common parent of such group 
                if treated as one corporation, and
                    ``(B) the treatment of any member of a foreign 
                controlled group of entities as the common parent of 
                such group if such treatment is appropriate taking into 
                account the economic relationships among such 
                entities.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to payments made after the date of the enactment of this Act.
                                 <all>
