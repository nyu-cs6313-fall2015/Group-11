        subtitle and acting through the Director of the Bureau of Land 
        Management in consultation with the Director of the United 
        States Fish and Wildlife Service, a competitive oil and gas 
        leasing program that will result in an environmentally sound

        oil and gas resources of the Coastal Plain; and
            (2) to administer the provisions of this subtitle through 
        regulations, lease terms, conditions, restrictions, 
        prohibitions, stipulations, and other provisions that ensure 
        the oil and gas exploration, development, and production 
        activities on the Coastal Plain will result in no significant 
        adverse effect on fish and wildlife, their habitat, subsistence 
        resources, and the environment, including, in furtherance of 
        this goal, by requiring the application of the best 
        commercially available technology for oil and gas exploration, 
        development, and production to all exploration, development, 
        and production operations under this subtitle in a manner that

        mineral resources to be leased.
    (b) Repeal.--
            (1) Repeal.--Section 1003 of the Alaska National Interest 
        Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (16 U.S.C. 3143) is repealed.

        authorized by this section in the Coastal Plain are deemed to 
        be compatible with the purposes for which the Arctic National 
        Wildlife Refuge was established, and no further findings or

            (2) Adequacy of the department of the interior's 
        legislative environmental impact statement.--The ``Final 
        Legislative Environmental Impact Statement'' (April 1987) on

        Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (16

        Secretary is not required to identify nonleasing alternative 
        courses of action or to analyze the environmental effects of 
        such courses of action. The Secretary shall only identify a 
        preferred action for such leasing and a single leasing 
        alternative, and analyze the environmental effects and 
        potential mitigation measures for those two alternatives. The 
        identification of the preferred action and related analysis for 
        the first lease sale under this subtitle shall be completed

        The Secretary shall designate as such a Special Area the 
        Sadlerochit Spring area, comprising approximately 4,000 acres.
