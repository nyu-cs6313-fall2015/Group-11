                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the tax 
  treatment of ABLE accounts established under State programs for the 
   care of family members with disabilities, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Achieving a Better Life Experience 
Act of 2014'' or the ``ABLE Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are as follows:
            (1) To encourage and assist individuals and families in 
        saving private funds for the purpose of supporting individuals 
        with disabilities to maintain health, independence, and quality 
        of life.
            (2) To provide secure funding for disability-related 
        expenses on behalf of designated beneficiaries with 
        disabilities that will supplement, but not supplant, benefits 
        provided through private insurance, the Medicaid program under 
        title XIX of the Social Security Act, the supplemental security 
        income program under title XVI of such Act, the beneficiary's 
        employment, and other sources.

SEC. 3. QUALIFIED ABLE PROGRAMS.

    (a) In General.--Subchapter F of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after section 529 the following 
new section:

``SEC. 529A. QUALIFIED ABLE PROGRAMS.

    ``(a) General Rule.--A qualified ABLE program shall be exempt from 
taxation under this subtitle. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, 
such program shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 511 
(relating to imposition of tax on unrelated business income of 
charitable organizations).
    ``(b) Qualified ABLE Program.--For purposes of this section--
            ``(1) In general.--The term `qualified ABLE program' means 
        a program established and maintained by a State, or agency or 
        instrumentality thereof--
                    ``(A) under which a person may make contributions 
                for a taxable year, for the benefit of an individual 
                who is an eligible individual for such taxable year, to 
                an ABLE account which is established for the purpose of 
                meeting the qualified disability expenses of the 
                designated beneficiary of the account,
                    ``(B) which limits a designated beneficiary to 1 
                ABLE account for purposes of this section,
                    ``(C) which allows for the establishment of an ABLE 
                account only for a beneficiary who is a resident of 
                such State or a resident of a contracting State, and
                    ``(D) which meets the other requirements of this 
                section.
            ``(2) Cash contributions.--A program shall not be treated 
        as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides that no 
        contribution will be accepted--
                    ``(A) unless it is in cash, or
                    ``(B) except in the case of contributions under 
                subsection (c)(1)(C), if such contribution to an ABLE 
                account would result in aggregate contributions from 
                all contributors to the ABLE account for the taxable 
                year exceeding the amount in effect under section 
                2503(b) for the calendar year in which the taxable year 
                begins.
        For purposes of this paragraph, rules similar to the rules of 
        section 408(d)(4) (determined without regard to subparagraph 
        (B) thereof) shall apply.
            ``(3) Separate accounting.--A program shall not be treated 
        as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides separate 
        accounting for each designated beneficiary.
            ``(4) No investment direction.--A program shall not be 
        treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides that any 
        contributor to, or designated beneficiary under, such program 
        may not directly or indirectly direct the investment of any 
        contributions to the program (or any earnings thereon).
            ``(5) No pledging of interest as security.--A program shall 
        not be treated as a qualified ABLE program if it allows any 
        interest in the program or any portion thereof to be used as 
        security for a loan.
            ``(6) Prohibition on excess contributions.--A program shall 
        not be treated as a qualified ABLE program unless it provides 
        adequate safeguards to prevent aggregate contributions on 
        behalf of a designated beneficiary in excess of the limit 
        established by the State under section 529(b)(6). For purposes 
        of the preceding sentence, aggregate contributions include 
        contributions under any prior qualified ABLE program of any 
        State or agency or instrumentality thereof.
    ``(c) Tax Treatment.--
            ``(1) Distributions.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Any distribution under a 
                qualified ABLE program shall be includible in the gross 
                income of the distributee in the manner as provided 
                under section 72 to the extent not excluded from gross 
                income under any other provision of this chapter.
                    ``(B) Distributions for qualified disability 
                expenses.--For purposes of this paragraph, if 
                distributions from a qualified ABLE program--
                            ``(i) do not exceed the qualified 
                        disability expenses of the designated 
                        beneficiary, no amount shall be includible in 
                        gross income, and
                            ``(ii) in any other case, the amount 
                        otherwise includible in gross income shall be 
                        reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio 
                        to such amount as such expenses bear to such 
                        distributions.
                    ``(C) Change in beneficiaries or programs.--
                            ``(i) Rollovers from able accounts.--
                        Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any amount 
                        paid or distributed from an ABLE account to the 
                        extent that the amount received is paid, not 
                        later than the 60th day after the date of such 
                        payment or distribution, into another ABLE 
                        account for the benefit of the same beneficiary 
                        or an eligible individual who is a family 
                        member of the beneficiary.
                            ``(ii) Change in designated 
                        beneficiaries.--Any change in the designated 
                        beneficiary of an interest in a qualified ABLE 
                        program during a taxable year shall not be 
                        treated as a distribution for purposes of 
                        subparagraph (A) if the new beneficiary is an 
                        eligible individual for such taxable year and a 
                        member of the family of the former beneficiary.
                            ``(iii) Limitation on certain rollovers.--
                        Clause (i) shall not apply to any transfer if 
                        such transfer occurs within 12 months from the 
                        date of a previous transfer to any qualified 
                        ABLE program for the benefit of the designated 
                        beneficiary.
                    ``(D) Operating rules.--For purposes of applying 
                section 72--
                            ``(i) except to the extent provided by the 
                        Secretary, all distributions during a taxable 
                        year shall be treated as one distribution, and
                            ``(ii) except to the extent provided by the 
                        Secretary, the value of the contract, income on 
                        the contract, and investment in the contract 
                        shall be computed as of the close of the 
                        calendar year in which the taxable year begins.
            ``(2) Gift tax rules.--For purposes of chapters 12 and 13--

                contribution under paragraph (1)(C) to the ABLE account 
                of a new beneficiary) during any taxable year unless, 
                as of the beginning of such taxable year, the new 
                beneficiary is both an eligible individual for such 
                taxable year and a member of the family of the former 
                beneficiary.
            ``(3) Additional tax for distributions not used for 
        disability expenses.--
