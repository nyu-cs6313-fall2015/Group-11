  To limit restrictions on deer hunting within the Kisatchie National 
                                Forest.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. HUNTING IN KISATCHIE NATIONAL FOREST.

    (a) In General.--Consistent with the Act of June 4, 1897 (16 U.S.C. 
551), the Secretary of Agriculture may not restrict the use of dogs in 
deer hunting activities in Kisatchie National Forest, unless such 
restrictions--
            (1) apply to the smallest practicable portions of such 
        unit; and
            (2) are necessary to reduce or control trespass onto land 
        adjacent to such unit.
    (b) Prior Restrictions Void.--Any restrictions regarding the use of 
dogs in deer hunting activities in Kisatchie National Forest in force 
on the date of the enactment of this Act shall be void and have no 
force or effect.
    (c) Adjacent Landowners.--Landowners whose property abuts a unit of 
the Kisatchie National Forest may petition the Secretary of Agriculture 
to restrict the use of dogs in deer hunting activities that take place 
on such units which abut their property. If the Secretary of 
Agriculture receives a petition from an adjacent landowner, the 
Secretary, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, may impose 
restrictions on the use of dogs in deer hunting--
            (1) limited to those units of the Kisatchie National Forest 
        within 300 yards of the boundary of the petitioning landowner's 
        property; and
            (2) consistent with subsection (a).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
