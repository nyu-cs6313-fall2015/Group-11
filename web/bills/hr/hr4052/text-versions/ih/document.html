                because of a use described in paragraph (1), (2), or 
                (4), notwithstanding the limitations of paragraph (5), 
                if such individual elects the application of this 
                paragraph for the taxable year, such individual shall 
                be allowed a deduction equal to the standard home 
                office deduction for the taxable year in lieu of the 
                deductions otherwise allowable under this chapter for 
                such taxable year by reason of such use.
                    ``(B) Standard home office deduction.--For purposes 
                of this paragraph, the standard home office deduction 
                is the lesser of--
                            ``(i) $1,500, or
                            ``(ii) the gross income derived from the

                        use occurs.
                    ``(C) Inflation adjustment.--In the case of any 
                taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2014, 
                the dollar amount in subparagraph (B)(i) shall be 
                increased by an amount equal to--
                            ``(i) such dollar amount, multiplied by
                            ``(ii) the cost-of-living adjustment 
                        determined under section 1(f)(3) for the 
                        calendar year in which the taxable year begins, 
                        determined by substituting `2013' for `1992' in 
                        subparagraph (B) thereof.
                Any increase determined under the preceding sentence
