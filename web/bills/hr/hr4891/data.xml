Opportunity Village Conveyance and Expansion Act of 2014 - Authorizes the Department of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), to accept the relinquishment by the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, of all or part of the Deer Springs/Thom/Rome/North Decatur site for conveyance to Opportunity Village, if Las Vegas prepares a survey and legal description of such site, and the survey conforms to BLM cadastral survey standards and meets the approval of Interior.

Directs Interior to convey the relinquished site to Opportunity Village upon request. Requires the land to be used only for: (1) the development of a nonprofit work center and affordable housing for people with intellectual disabilities, and (2) ancillary use compatible with the mission of Opportunity Village.

States that all land conveyed by Interior under this Act shall be at no cost, except that Interior may require the recipient to bear any costs associated with the transfer of title and any necessary land surveys.</summary>
