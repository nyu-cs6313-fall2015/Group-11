                                 A BILL


 
   To provide for a grants program to develop and enhance integrated 
                nutrition curricula in medical schools.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Nutrition's Role in 
Curricula and Healthcare Act'' or the ``ENRICH Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2012, United States health care spending was about 
        $8,915 per resident and accounted for 17.2 percent of the 
        Nation's gross domestic product, which is among the highest of 
        all industrialized countries.
            (2) Expenditures in the United States on health care 
        surpassed $2.3 trillion in 2008, more than three times the $714 
        billion spent in 1990, and over eight times the $253 billion 
        spent in 1980.
            (3) It is estimated that health care costs for chronic 
        disease treatment account for over 75 percent of national 
        health expenditures.
            (4) The last major report from the World Health 
        Organization in March 2003 concluded diet was a major factor in 
        the cause of chronic diseases.
            (5) Seven out of 10 deaths among Americans each year are 
        from chronic diseases. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke--each 
        of which has been strongly linked to dietary and lifestyle 
        choices--account for more than 50 percent of all deaths each 
        year.
            (6) About 81.1 million people in the United States have at 
        least one form of cardiovascular disease. Approximately 2,300 
        Americans die every day from cardiovascular disease. In 2010, 
        cardiovascular disease cost American taxpayers $189.4 billion. 
        The American Heart Association estimates that, by 2030, direct 
        costs related to cardiovascular disease will triple to around 
        $818 billion. Research has shown that following a healthful 
        diet can not only reduce symptoms related to heart disease but 
        also reverse the damage done to the arteries.
            (7) Two-thirds of the American population is currently 
        overweight, half of whom are obese. One in three children is 
        now overweight, and one-fifth of children are obese. In 2008, 
        the United States spent $190 billion on obesity-related health 
        care costs.
            (8) An estimated 25.8 million Americans have diabetes. 
        Another 79 million adults have prediabetes. The Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention predict that one in three 
        children born in 2000 will develop diabetes at some point in 
        their lives. Diabetes cost the government $116 billion in 2007. 
        Research has shown that nutrition therapy is a key component of 
        diabetes management and can improve clinical outcomes.
            (9) Cancer kills approximately 570,000 Americans each year, 
        accounting for one in every four deaths. More than 1.5 million 
        new cancer cases are diagnosed annually. In 2010, the direct 
        costs of cancer were $102.8 billion and that number is expected 
        to rise to $172 billion by 2020. More than 33 percent of 
        cancers are diet related and could be prevented with a 
        healthful diet.
            (10) Eating is a complex social phenomenon influenced by 
        family, social networks, culture, socioeconomic and educational 
        status. An interprofessional approach to nutrition education 
        for clinicians may not necessarily overcome these forces but 
        may help the health professions team identify effective 
        strategies for nutrition counseling and management.
            (11) Physicians are an important source of information and 
        motivation for patients' health behavior. Multiple studies have 
        shown that physician counseling on weight loss increases the 
        likelihood that patients will attempt weight loss, increase 
        physical activity, improve diet, and lose weight.
            (12) Leading medical bodies recommend that physicians 
        address diet with overweight patients. Guidelines from leading 
        medical bodies such as the National Institutes of Health, the 
        American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, 
        and the Obesity Society recommend that physicians counsel 
        overweight and obese patients on the benefits of lifestyle 
        changes through lifestyle changes such as diet and physical 
        activity.
