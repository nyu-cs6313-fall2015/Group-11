annual outcome measures developed by the Secretary, the Secretary shall

shall describe how and when it plans to meet such outcome measures. The 
Secretary must approve such plan before the Secretary may make a 
subsequent grant to that agency under this subsection.

under this subsection may not be used to provide more than 50 percent

give priority to State and county veterans agencies that serve the 
largest populations of veterans.
    ``(8)(A) In a case in which a county government does not have a 
county veterans agency, the county government may be awarded a grant 
under this subsection to establish such an agency.
    ``(B) In a case in which a county government does not have a county
