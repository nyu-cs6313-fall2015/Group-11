To amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for a more equitable

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Equitable Treatment Act''.

SEC. 2. STANDARD FOR TIME FOR REFERRAL FOR SPECIALIST CARE.

    (a) Time for Specialist Appointments.--
            (1) Requirement.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall 
        establish by regulation a maximum specialist referral period, 
        subject to such exceptions as the Secretary considers 
        necessary.
            (2) Specialist referral period defined.--For purposes of 
        paragraph (1), the term ``specialist referral period'' means 
        the period of time between (A) the date on which a veteran is 
        referred to a specialty clinic of the Department by the 
        veteran's primary care physician within the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs health care system, and (B) the date for which 
        the veteran is scheduled for an appointment with a Department 
        specialist pursuant to such referral.
            (3) Department policies.--In establishing a maximum 
        specialist referral period under paragraph (1), the Secretary 
        shall act in a manner consistent with the current treatment 
        policies of the Department based on clinical need and with the 
        established 30-30-20 performance goal of the Department for 
        such a referral period.
    (b) Standard for Transportation.--The Secretary shall take such 
steps as necessary to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs is 
able to provide appropriate transportation services for qualified 
veterans within a reasonable time period of a scheduled appointment.

SEC. 3. CONTRACT CARE TO BE PROVIDED WHEN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS 
              AFFAIRS CARE NOT AVAILABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDS.

    (a) Contract Care.--In any case in which the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs is not able to provide hospital care or medical services in 
accordance with the standard prescribed under section 2(a) or to 
provide transportation services in accordance with section 2(b), the 
Secretary shall promptly provide for such care or transportation from a 
private source. Hospital care or medical services so provided shall be 
those for which the veteran is otherwise eligible within the Department 
of Veterans Affairs medical care system.
    (b) Reimbursement Rate.--Whenever care or services are provided 
under subsection (a), the Secretary shall reimburse the provider of 
such care or services for the reasonable value of such care or 
services, as determined by the Secretary. Such reimbursement shall be 
provided in the same manner as applies to reimbursement for emergency 
treatment under section 1725 of title 38, United States Code, subject 
to such of the terms and conditions otherwise applicable to such 
reimbursements under such section as the Secretary determines to be 
appropriate for purposes of this section.
    (c) Expedited Reimbursement Procedures.--The Secretary shall take 
appropriate steps to expedite the reimbursement required by subsection 
(b) and consistent with the Veterans Health Administration policy that 
90 percent of all non-VA Contract Care claims are processed within 30 
days of receipt. Such steps may include steps to make use of advanced 
technology, such as smart card technology that would allow claims for 
such reimbursement to be processed electronically. The Secretary shall, 
to the extent possible, also apply such steps for expediting 
reimbursement to claims for emergency services provided to veterans for 
which the Secretary provides reimbursement under provisions of law in 
effect before the date of the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 4. TERMINATION OF 24-MONTH RULE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR EMERGENCY 
              SERVICES.

    The provisions of subparagraph (B) of section 1725(b)(2) of title 
38, United States Code, shall not apply with respect to emergency 
treatment furnished on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.

    The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to the Committees on 
Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report 
at the end of each fiscal-year quarter on the waiting times for 
appointments in the Department of Veterans Affairs medical care system. 
The report shall describe any reductions in such waiting times and any 
experience with appointment delays.
