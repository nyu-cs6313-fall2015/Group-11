  <summary>11/21/2013--Introduced.
Establishes in the legislative branch the Commission on Health Care Savings through Innovative Wireless Technologies, which shall:

 examine the cost savings to the U.S. health care system that can be achieved by increasing the use of wireless health information technologies by patients, caregivers, and health care providers; examine existing scientific research studying the medical effectiveness of such technologies; examine existing payment models and incentive payment programs that provide federal financial reimbursement or funding for the use of such technologies; examine options for Congress and federal agencies to incentivize and promote innovation and technological advancements in the area of such technologies; examine barriers to marketplace entry that impede efforts to develop new, and improve existing, wireless health information technologies; identify appropriate situations and recommend methods for integrating such technologies into federal health care programs; develop a proposal for a comprehensive program to encourage such integration; develop cost estimate approaches that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) can use to more accurately assess the cost savings the government can achieve by increasing the use of such technologies by patients, caregivers, and health care providers; and submit an interim report within 9 months and a final report within 18 months after its final member is appointed.</summary>
