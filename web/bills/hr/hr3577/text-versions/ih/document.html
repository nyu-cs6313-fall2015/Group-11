    The duties of the Commission shall be the following:
            (1) Examine the cost savings to the United States health 
        care system, if any, that can be achieved by increasing the use 
        of wireless health information technologies (including 
        technologies related to digital health, mobile health 
        (mHealth), telehealth, telemedicine, e-Care, remote patient 
        monitoring, and the collection of patient-generated health 
        data) by patients, caregivers, and health care providers.
            (2) Examine existing scientific research studying the 
        medical effectiveness of wireless health information 
        technologies that deliver health care.
            (3) Examine existing payment models and incentive payment 
        programs that provide Federal financial reimbursement or 
        funding for the use of wireless health information 
        technologies.
            (4) Examine options for Congress and for appropriate 
        Federal agencies to incentivize and promote innovation and 
        technological advancements in the area of wireless health 
        information technologies.
            (5) Examine barriers to marketplace entry, whether 
        technical or systemic, that impede efforts by persons and 
        entities to develop new wireless health information 
        technologies and to improve existing wireless health 
        information technologies.
            (6) Identify appropriate situations for the integration of 
        wireless health information technologies into Federal health 
        care programs, and recommend methods for integrating such 
        technologies into such programs.
            (7) Develop a proposal based on the findings of its 
        examinations under this section for the establishment, 
        implementation, and financing of a comprehensive program to 
        encourage the further integration of wireless health 
        information technologies into existing Federal health care 
        programs.
            (8) Develop cost estimate approaches that the Congressional 
        Budget Office can consider utilizing in order to more 
        accurately assess the cost savings that the Federal Government 
        can achieve by increasing the use of wireless health 
        information technologies by patients, caregivers, and health 
        care providers in the United States.
