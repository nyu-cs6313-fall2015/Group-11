Directs such office to cooperate with the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Innocence Lost National Initiative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nAllow victims of human trafficking crimes to claim awards allowed for whistleblowing.\n\nAmends the Internal Revenue Code to increase civil and criminal penalties for tax evasion attributable to income derived from human trafficking and commercial sex acts. Makes it a felony to fail to file a tax return including income derived from human trafficking or commercial sex acts. Appropriates to the Crime Victims Fund additional funds equal to the increase in receipts from increased civil and criminal penalties provided by this Act."
