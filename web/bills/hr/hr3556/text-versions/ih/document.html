                                 A BILL


 
To establish a program to assist in the importation and care of abused, 
                injured, or abandoned nonhuman primates.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Humane Care for Primates Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Nonhuman primates, such as chimpanzees, gorillas, 
        orangutans, macaques, and numerous other species, often face 
        abusive and cruel captive conditions in other countries.
            (2) There is growing evidence that, absent a suitable 
        humane alternative, these primates will remain or be placed in 
        other cruel captive conditions and face inhumane deaths in 
        areas outside the United States.
            (3) Regulations of the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention allow importation of nonhuman primates only for 
        scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes and not for 
        humane lifetime shelter and care in appropriate primate 
        sanctuaries.
            (4) Many of these animals could be obtained by certified 
        primate sanctuaries in the United States and provided with 
        shelter and care for the remainder of their natural lives in a 
        species-appropriate, humane environment if allowed by law to be 
        imported for such purpose.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) The term ``certified primate sanctuary'' means a 
        primate sanctuary that has been certified by the Secretary 
        pursuant to section 4.
            (2) The term ``nonhuman primates'' means the species 
        included in the biological order Primates, except Homo sapiens.
            (3) The term ``primate sanctuary'' means a facility that--

                abandoned, or are otherwise in need;
                    (B) is an organization described in section 
                501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and

                        involved is best served by participating in a

                            (ii) the facility reasonably believes that 
                        the outcome of the study will provide a 
                        tangible benefit to the animal involved.
            (4) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health 
        and Human Services.

SEC. 4. IMPORTATION OF NONHUMAN PRIMATES.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 12 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary, consistent with section 361 of 
the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 264; relating to control of 
communicable diseases), shall promulgate a final rule revising section 
71.53(c) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, to expand the 
categories of uses for which nonhuman primates may be imported and 
distributed to include live nonhuman primates imported into the United 
States by a certified primate sanctuary for purposes of providing 
lifetime shelter and care.
    (b) Certification Process.--
            (1) Establishment.--The rule required by subsection (a) 
        shall establish a process under which the Secretary certifies 
        facilities as primate sanctuaries for purposes of the 
        importation, shelter, and care of nonhuman primates, as 
        described in subsection (a).
            (2) Criteria.--The Secretary shall require, as a condition 
        of such certification, that a facility--
                    (A) is a primate sanctuary, as defined in section 
                3; and
                    (B) satisfies any other criteria that--
                            (i) are determined to be appropriate by the 
                        Secretary; and
                            (ii) are consistent with the criteria 
                        specified in the definition of a primate 
                        sanctuary in section 3.
            (3) Applications.--To seek certification under this Act, a 
        primate sanctuary shall submit an application in such form, in 
        such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary 
        may require. Any information in an application for 
        certification under this Act shall be protected from disclosure 
        as provided in section 552(b)(4) of title 5, United States 
        Code.
