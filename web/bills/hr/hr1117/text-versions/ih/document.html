                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to apply the ban on 
    contributions and expenditures by foreign nationals to domestic 
  corporations in which foreign principals have an ownership interest.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``America is for 
Americans Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Government has a compelling interest in preventing 
        foreign individuals and associations from influencing our 
        Nation's political process. Such entities neither enjoy nor 
        deserve any legal or constitutional right to such influence.
            (2) The presence of foreign individuals or associations 
        within domestic associations, to any degree, creates an 
        unacceptable risk of foreign influence over our Nation's 
        political process.
            (3) The law does not allow foreign individuals and 
        associations to vote in our elections; by the same token, the 
        law should not allow them to exercise any influence over our 
        Nation's political process, directly or indirectly, and neither 
        personally nor in alliance or combination with others.

SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF BAN ON CONTRIBUTIONS AND EXPENDITURES BY FOREIGN 
              NATIONALS TO DOMESTIC CORPORATIONS WITH FOREIGN 
              OWNERSHIP.

    Section 319(b) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 
U.S.C. 441e(b)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``or'' at the end of paragraph (1);
            (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (2) and 
        inserting ``; or''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(3) a corporation (other than a foreign principal, as so 
        defined) in which one or more foreign principals directly or 
        indirectly has an ownership interest.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
