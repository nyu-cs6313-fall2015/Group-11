                                 A BILL


 
     To require government-wide application of continuous process 
 improvement methods to reduce waste and improve the effectiveness of 
            the Federal Government, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lean and Responsive Government 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Nearly 100 major United States corporations, countless 
        small businesses, and many government entities around the world 
        have reduced waste in their operations and improved the quality 
        of the goods and services they provide by implementing 
        continuous process improvement methodologies, most commonly 
        lean six sigma.
            (2) Use of this methodology has resulted in average cost 
        reductions greater than 25 percent while also improving the 
        quality of goods and services.
            (3) The use of continuous process improvement lean six 
        sigma within the Department of Defense and several other 
        departments and agencies has demonstrated that it can 
        successfully be applied across the Federal Government.
            (4) Continuous process improvement is essential for Federal 
        agencies to be successful in setting and meeting performance 
        goals and is a key component that is missing from current 
        statutory requirements for performance improvement efforts.
            (5) Clear direction and authority from Congress is needed 
        to ensure this innovative management process from the private 
        sector is applied across the Federal Government to achieve 
        waste reduction and optimal efficiency.
    (b) Congressional Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of 
the United States--
            (1) to reduce waste and improve the effectiveness of the 
        Federal Government through the use of continuous process 
        improvement methods;
            (2) to require each Federal agency to implement the 
        necessary capabilities to fully institutionalize such methods 
        within such agency to reduce waste while maintaining or 
        improving the level of services provided by the Federal 
        Government; and
            (3) that the savings from such methods may be used to 
        justify agency funding requests.
