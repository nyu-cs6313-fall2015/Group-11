        ``cost-effective energy efficiency measure'' means any building 
        product, material, equipment, or service, and the installing, 
        implementing, or operating thereof, that provides energy 
        savings in an amount that is not less than the cost of such 
        installing, implementing, or operating.
            (3) Cost-effective water efficiency measure.--The term 
        ``cost-effective water efficiency measure'' means any building 
        product, material, equipment, or service, and the installing, 
        implementing, or operating thereof, that provides water savings 
        in an amount that is not less than the cost of such installing,

            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation with 
        the Secretary of Energy and after providing the public with an 
        opportunity for notice and comment, shall develop model leasing 
        provisions and best practices in accordance with this 
        subsection.
            (2) Commercial leasing.--
                    (A) In general.--The model commercial leasing 
                provisions developed under this subsection shall, at a 
                minimum, align the interests of building owners and 
                tenants with regard to investments in cost-effective 
                energy efficiency measures and cost-effective water 
                efficiency measures to encourage building owners and 
                tenants to collaborate to invest in such measures.
                    (B) Use of model provisions.--The Administrator may 
                use the model provisions developed under this 
                subsection in any standard leasing document that 
                designates a Federal agency (or other client of the 
                Administrator) as a landlord or tenant.
                    (C) Publication.--The Administrator shall 
                periodically publish the model leasing provisions 
                developed under this subsection, along with explanatory 
                materials, to encourage building owners and tenants in 
                the private sector to use such provisions and 
                materials.
            (3) Realty services.--The Administrator shall develop 
        policies and practices to implement cost-effective energy 
        efficiency measures and cost-effective water efficiency 
        measures for the realty services provided by the Administrator 
        to Federal agencies (or other clients of the Administrator), 
        including periodic training of appropriate Federal employees 
        and contractors on how to identify and evaluate those measures.
            (4) State and local assistance.--The Administrator, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall make available 
        model leasing provisions and best practices developed under 
        this subsection to State, county, and municipal governments to 
        manage owned and leased building space in accordance with the 
        goal of encouraging investment in all cost-effective energy 
        efficiency measures and cost-effective water efficiency 
        measures.
