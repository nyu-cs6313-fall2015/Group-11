_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To amend title III of the Public Health Service Act to provide for the 
 establishment and implementation of guidelines on best practices for 
 diagnosis, treatment, and management of mild traumatic brain injuries 
        (MTBIs) in school-aged children, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Concussion Treatment and Care Tools 
Act of 2013'' or the ``ConTACT Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Concussions are mild traumatic brain injuries, the 
        long-term effects of which are not well understood.
            (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention (CDC), each year United States emergency departments 
        treat an estimated 173,285 sports- and recreation-related mild 
        traumatic brain injuries (MTBIs), including concussions, among 
        children and adolescents, from birth to 19 years of age. 
        However, this number does not capture the total number, as many 
        MTBIs go undiagnosed.
            (3) There is an increased risk for subsequent brain 
        injuries among persons who have had at least one previous brain 
        injury.
            (4) A repeat concussion, one that occurs before the brain 
        recovers from a previous concussion, can slow recovery or 
        increase the likelihood of having long-term problems.
            (5) In rare cases, repeat concussions can result in second 
        impact syndrome, which can be marked by brain swelling, 
        permanent brain damage, and death.
            (6) Recurrent brain injuries and second impact syndrome are 
        highly preventable.
            (7) Many States have adopted concussion management rules 
        and regulations, but many schools lack the resources to 
        implement best practices in concussion diagnosis and 
        management.

SEC. 3. GUIDELINES ON BEST PRACTICES FOR DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND 
              MANAGEMENT OF MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES IN SCHOOL-
              AGED CHILDREN.

    Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act 6 (42 U.S.C. 
243 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 317T the following:

``SEC. 317U. GUIDELINES ON BEST PRACTICES FOR DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND
