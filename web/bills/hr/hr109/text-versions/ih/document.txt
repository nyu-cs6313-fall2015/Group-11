    (a) Constitutional Authority for This Act.--This Act is enacted 
pursuant to the power granted Congress under article I, section 8,

    ``(a) Each Act of Congress shall contain a concise and definite 
statement of the constitutional authority relied upon for the enactment 
of each portion of that Act. The failure to comply with this section 
shall give rise to a point of order in either House of Congress. The 
availability of this point of order does not affect any other available 
relief.
    ``(b) The provisions of this section are enacted by the Congress--
            ``(1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House 
        of Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such 
        they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, 
        respectively, or of that House to which they specifically 
        apply, and such rules shall supersede other rules only to the 
        extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and
            ``(2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change such rules (so far as relating to such 
        House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent 
        as in the case of any other rule of such House.''.
