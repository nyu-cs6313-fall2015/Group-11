        information required by Form D for each new offering of 
        securities no earlier than the date of first sale of securities

        issuer to file any notice of sales containing the information 
        required by Form D except for the single notice described in 
        the previous sentence.
            (2) The Commission shall make the information contained in 
        each Form D filing available to the securities commission (or

        and territory of the United States and the District of 
        Columbia.
            (3) The Commission shall not condition the availability of

        connection with a Rule 506(c) offering, except when the

        of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77h-1 or 77t) or section 9, 10(b), 21A, 21B,

            (5) The Commission shall not extend the requirements 
        contained in Rule 156 to private funds.
            (6) The Commission shall revise Rule 501(a) of Regulation D
