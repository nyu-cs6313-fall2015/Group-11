                                 A BILL


 
 To direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to 
        issue regulations regarding secondary cockpit barriers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The safety and security of the civil air transportation 
        system is critical to the United States security and its 
        national defense.
            (2) A safe and secure United States civil air 
        transportation system is essential to the basic freedom of 
        Americans to move in intrastate, interstate, and international 
        transportation.
            (3) Terrorists have previously used airline aircraft as 
        weapons and exploited United States aviation security.
            (4) Reinforced cockpit doors that must be opened for 
        physiological and operational needs present a clear 
        vulnerability when the doors are open and this compromises the 
        security and safety of the aircraft and its passengers.
            (5) Many all-cargo aircraft do not have a cockpit door 
        installed for protection from passenger aggressors and 
        stowaways.

SEC. 2. IMPROVED FLIGHT DECK INTEGRITY MEASURES.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall issue regulations--
            (1) requiring the installation of secondary barriers 
        preventing access to the flight deck of any commercial aircraft 
        operating under part 121 of title 14, Code of Federal 
        Regulations; and
            (2)(A) for an aircraft that is equipped with a cockpit 
        door, requiring that such secondary barriers remain locked 
        while the aircraft is in flight and the cockpit door separating 
        the flight deck and the passenger area is open; and
            (B) for an aircraft that is not equipped with a cockpit 
        door, requiring that such secondary barriers remain locked as 
        determined by the pilot in command.
    (b) Considerations.--In issuing regulations under this section, the 
Administrator shall take into account--
            (1) the most promising and cost effective of the available 
        technologies relating to secondary barriers described in 
        subsection (a); and
            (2) the cost and time schedule for deploying such barriers.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
