SEC. 102. GROUP ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Criteria.--A group of workers shall be certified by the

        industry, as determined by the Commission;

        company, information the Commission determines to be necessary 
        to make the certification, through questionnaires and in such 
        other manner as the Commission determines appropriate. The 
        Commission shall establish standards, including data 
        requirements, for investigations of petitions filed under 
        section 101 and criteria for making determinations under 
        section 103.
            (2) Additional information.--The Commission may seek 
        additional information to determine whether to certify a group 
        of workers--
                    (A) by contacting--
                            (i) officials or employees of the workers' 
                        company;

                        the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of 
                        Commerce, or the Secretary of the Treasury, as

                    (B) by using other available sources of 
                information.
            (3) Verification of information.--
                    (A) Certification.--The Commission shall require a 
                company or customer to certify--
                            (i) all information obtained under 
                        paragraph (1) from the company through 
                        questionnaires; and
                            (ii) all other information obtained under 
                        paragraph (1) from the company on which the 
                        Commission relies in making a determination 
                        under section 103, unless the Commission has a 
                        reasonable basis for determining that such 
                        information is accurate and complete without 
                        being certified.
                    (B) Use of subpoenas.--The Commission shall require 
                the workers' company to provide information requested 
                by the Commission under paragraph (1) by subpoena 
                pursuant to section 310 if the company fails to provide 
                the information within 20 days after the date of the 
                Commission's request, unless the company demonstrates 
                to the satisfaction of the Commission that the company 
                will provide the information within a reasonable period 
                of time.
                    (C) Protection of confidential information.--The 
                Commission may not release information obtained under 
                paragraph (1) that the Commission considers to be 
                confidential business information unless the company 
                submitting the confidential business information had 
                notice, at the time of submission, that the information 
                would be released by the Commission, or the company 
                subsequently consents to the release of the 
                information. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be 
                construed to prohibit the Commission from providing 
                such confidential business information to a court in 
                camera or to another party under a protective order 
                issued by a court.

    (a) In General.--As soon as possible after the date on which a 
petition is filed under section 101, but in any event not later than 40 
days after that date, the Commission shall determine whether the 
petitioning group meets the requirements of section 102 and shall issue 
a certification of eligibility to apply for assistance under this Act 
covering workers in any group which meets such requirements. Each 
certification shall specify the date on which the total or partial 
separation began or threatened to begin.

determines, with respect to any certification of eligibility of the 
workers of a company, that total or partial separations from such 
company are no longer attributable to the factors described in section 
102(a), the Commission shall terminate such certification and promptly 
have notice of such termination published in the Federal Register and 
on the website of the Commission, together with the Commission's 
reasons for making such determination. Such termination shall apply 
only with respect to total or partial separations occurring after the 
termination date specified by the Commission.

provide whatever assistance is necessary to enable groups of workers to 
prepare petitions or applications for program benefits. The Commission 
shall make every effort to insure that cooperating State agencies fully 
comply with the agreements entered into under section 302 and shall 
periodically review such compliance. The Commission shall inform the 
State Board for Vocational Education or equivalent agency and other 
public or private agencies, institutions, and employers, as

provide written notice through the mail of the benefits available under 
this Act to each worker whom the Commission has reason to believe is 
covered by a certification made under title I--

        was partially or totally separated from the adversely affected 
        employment before such certification, or
            (B) at the time of the total or partial separation of the 
        worker from the adversely affected employment, if subparagraph 
        (A) does not apply.
    (c) Published Notice.--The Commission shall publish notice of the 
benefits available under this Act to workers covered by each 
certification made under title I in newspapers of general circulation 
in the areas in which such workers reside.

certification, if the following conditions are met:
            (1) Such worker's total or partial separation before the 
        worker's application under this subtitle occurred--
                    (A) on or after the date, as specified in the 
                certification under which the worker is covered, on 
                which total or partial separation began or threatened 
                to begin in the adversely affected employment,
                    (B) before the expiration of the 2-year period 
                beginning on the date on which the determination under 
                section 103 was made, and

        more, but not more than 7 weeks, in case of weeks described in 
        subparagraph (A) or (C), or both (and not more than 26 weeks, 
        in the case of weeks described in subparagraph (B) or (D)), may 
        be treated as weeks of employment under this sentence.
            (3) Such worker--
                    (A) was entitled to (or would be entitled to if the 
                worker applied therefor) unemployment insurance for a 
                week within the benefit period (i) in which such total 
                or partial separation took place, or (ii) which began 
                (or would have begun) by reason of the filing of a 
                claim for unemployment insurance by such worker after 
                such total or partial separation;
                    (B) has exhausted all rights to any unemployment 
                insurance, except additional compensation that is 
                funded by a State and is not reimbursed from any 
                Federal funds, to which the worker was entitled (or 
                would be entitled if the worker applied therefor); and
                    (C) does not have an unexpired waiting period 
                applicable to the worker for any such unemployment 
                insurance.
            (4) Such worker, with respect to such week of unemployment, 
        would not be disqualified for extended compensation payable 
        under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act 
        of 1970 by reason of the work acceptance and job search 
        requirements in section 202(a)(3) of such Act.
            (5) Such worker--
                    (A)(i) is enrolled in a training program approved 
                by the Commission under section 222, and
                    (ii) the enrollment required under clause (i) 
                occurs no later than the latest of--
                            (I) in the case of a worker whose most 
                        recent total separation from adversely affected 
                        employment that meets the requirements of 
                        paragraphs (1) and (2) occurs after the date on 
                        which the Commission issues a certification 
                        covering the worker, the last day of the 26th 
                        week after such total separation,
                            (II) in the case of a worker whose most 
                        recent total separation from adversely affected 
                        employment that meets the requirements of 
                        paragraphs (1) and (2) occurs before the date 
                        on which the Commission issues a certification 
                        covering the worker, the last day of the 26th 
                        week after the date of such certification,
                            (III) 45 days after the date specified in 
                        subclause (I) or (II), as the case may be, if 
                        the Commission determines there are extenuating 
                        circumstances that justify an extension in the 
                        enrollment period,
                            (IV) in the case of a worker who fails to 
                        enroll by the date required by subclause (I), 
                        (II), or (III), as the case may be, due to the 
                        failure to provide the worker with timely 
                        information regarding the date specified in 
                        such subclause, the last day of a period 
                        determined by the Commission, or
                            (V) the last day of a period determined by 
                        the Commission to be approved for enrollment 
                        after the termination of a waiver issued 
                        pursuant to subsection (c),
                    (B) has, after the date on which the worker became 
                totally separated, or partially separated, from the 
                adversely affected employment, completed a training 
                program approved by the Commission under section 
                222(a), or
                    (C) has received a written statement under 
                subsection (c)(1) after the date described in 
                subparagraph (B).
    (b) Disqualification.--If--
            (1) the Commission determines that--
                    (A) the adversely affected worker--
                            (i) has failed to begin participation in 
                        the training program the enrollment in which 
                        meets the requirement of subsection (a)(5), or
                            (ii) has ceased to participate in such 
                        training program before completing such 
                        training program, and
                    (B) there is no justifiable cause for such failure 
                or cessation, or
            (2) the certification made with respect to such worker 
        under subsection (c)(1) is revoked under subsection (c)(2),
no readjustment allowance may be paid to the adversely affected worker 
under this part for the week in which such failure, cessation, or 
revocation occurred, or any succeeding week, until the adversely 
affected worker begins or resumes participation in a training program 
approved under section 222.
    (c) Waivers of Training Requirements.--
            (1) Issuance of waivers.--The Commission may issue a 
        written statement to an adversely affected worker waiving the 
        requirement to be enrolled in training described in subsection 
        (a)(5)(A) if the Commission determines that it is not feasible 
        or appropriate for the worker, because of 1 or more of the 
        following reasons:
                    (A) Health.--The worker is unable to participate in 
                training due to the health of the worker, except that a 
                waiver under this subparagraph shall not be construed 
                to exempt a worker from requirements relating to the 
                availability for work, active search for work, or 
                refusal to accept work under Federal or State 
                unemployment compensation laws.
                    (B) Enrollment unavailable.--The first available 
                enrollment date for the approved training of the worker 
                is within 60 days after the date of the determination 
                made under this paragraph, or, if later, there are 
                extenuating circumstances for the delay in enrollment, 
                as determined pursuant to guidelines issued by the 
                Commission.
                    (C) Training not available.--Training approved by 
                the Commission is not reasonably available to the 
                worker from either governmental agencies or private 
                sources (which may include area career and technical 
                education schools, as defined in section 3 of the Carl 
                D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 
                (20 U.S.C. 2302), and employers), no training that is 
                suitable for the worker is available at a reasonable 
                cost, or no training funds are available.
                    (D) Nearing retirement.--The worker is within 3 
                years of the age of retirement.
            (2) Duration of waivers.--
                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph 
                (3)(B), a waiver issued under paragraph (1) shall be 
                effective for not more than 6 months after the date on 
                which the waiver is issued, unless the Commission 
                determines otherwise.
                    (B) Revocation.--The Commission shall revoke a 
                waiver issued under paragraph (1) if the Commission 
                determines that the basis of a waiver is no longer 
                applicable to the worker and shall notify the worker in 
                writing of the revocation.

SEC. 202. WEEKLY AMOUNTS.

    (a) In General.--Subject to subsections (b), (c), and (d), the 
readjustment allowance payable to an adversely affected worker for a 
week of unemployment shall be an amount equal to the most recent weekly 
benefit amount of the unemployment insurance payable to the worker for 
a week of total unemployment preceding the worker's first exhaustion of 
unemployment insurance (as determined for purposes of section 
201(a)(3)(B)) reduced (but not below zero) by--
            (1) any training allowance deductible under subsection (c); 
        and
            (2) income that is deductible from unemployment insurance 
        under the disqualifying income provisions of the applicable 
        State law or Federal unemployment insurance law, except that in 
        the case of an adversely affected worker who is participating 
        in training under this Act, such income shall not include 
        earnings from work for such week that are equal to or less than 
        the most recent weekly benefit amount of the unemployment 
        insurance payable to the worker for a week of total 
        unemployment preceding the worker's first exhaustion of 
        unemployment insurance (as determined for purposes of section 
        201(a)(3)(B)).
    (b) Greater of Transition Adjustment Allowance or Other Job 
Training Allowance.--Any adversely affected worker who is entitled to 
readjustment allowances and who is undergoing training approved by the 
Commission, shall receive for each week in which he or she is 
undergoing any such training, a readjustment allowance in an amount 
(computed for such week) equal to the amount computed under subsection 
(a) or (if greater) the amount of any weekly allowance for such 
training to which he would be entitled under any other Federal law for 
the training of workers, if he applied for such allowance. Such 
readjustment allowance shall be paid in lieu of any training allowance 
to which the worker would be entitled under such other Federal law.
    (c) No Double-Dipping.--If a training allowance under any Federal 
law other than this Act, is paid to an adversely affected worker for 
any week of unemployment with respect to which he would be entitled 
(determined without regard to any disqualification under section 
201(b)) to a readjustment allowance if he applied for such allowance, 
each such week shall be deducted from the total number of weeks of 
readjustment allowance otherwise payable to him or her under this 
section when he applies for a readjustment allowance and is determined 
to be entitled to such allowance. If such training allowance paid to 
such worker for any week of unemployment is less than the amount of the 
readjustment allowance to which he would be entitled if he applied for 
such allowance, he shall receive, when he applies for a readjustment 
allowance and is determined to be entitled to such allowance, a 
readjustment allowance for such week equal to such difference.
    (d) Election of Transition Adjustment Allowance or Unemployment 
Insurance.--Notwithstanding section 201(a)(3)(B), an adversely affected 
worker may elect to receive a readjustment allowance instead of 
unemployment insurance during any week with respect to which the 
worker--
            (1) is entitled to receive unemployment insurance as a 
        result of the establishment by the worker of a new benefit year 
        under State law, based in whole or in part upon part-time or 
        short-term employment in which the worker engaged after the 
        worker's most recent total separation from adversely affected 
        employment; and
            (2) is otherwise entitled to a readjustment allowance.
    (e) Maximum Allowance.--The maximum amount of readjustment 
allowances payable with respect to the period covered by any 
certification to an adversely affected worker shall be the amount which 
is the product of 52 multiplied by the readjustment allowance payable 
to the worker for a week of total unemployment (as determined under 
subsection (a)), but such product shall be reduced by the total sum of 
the unemployment insurance to which the worker was entitled (or would 
have been entitled if he had applied therefor) in the worker's first 
benefit period described in section 201(a)(3)(A).

        institutions of higher education (as defined in section 102 of 
        such Act (20 U.S.C. 1002)) to use the administrators' 
        discretion under section 479A of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1087tt) to

SEC. 222. TRAINING.

    (a) Approval for Training.--
            (1) Approval.--If the Commission determines, with respect 
        to an adversely affected worker or an adversely affected 
        incumbent worker, that--
                    (A) there is no suitable employment (which may 
                include technical and professional employment) 
                available for an adversely affected worker,
                    (B) the worker would benefit from appropriate 
                training,
                    (C) there is a reasonable expectation of employment 
                following completion of such training,
                    (D) training approved by the Commission is 
                reasonably available to the worker from either 
                governmental agencies or private sources (which may 
                include area career and technical education schools, as 
                defined in section 3 of the Carl D. Perkins Career and 
                Technical Education Act of 2006, and employers),
                    (E) the worker is qualified to undertake and 
                complete such training, and
                    (F) such training is suitable for the worker and 
                available at a reasonable cost,
        the Commission shall approve such training for the worker. Upon 
        such approval, the worker shall be entitled to have payment of 
        the costs of such training (subject to the limitations imposed 
        by this section) paid on the worker's behalf by the Commission 
        directly or through a voucher system. Insofar as possible, the 
        Secretary shall provide or assure the provision of such 
        training on the job, which shall include related education 
        necessary for the acquisition of skills needed for a position 
        within a particular occupation.
            (2) Funding and limitation on total distribution of 
        funds.--(A) The total amount of payments that may be made under 
        paragraph (1) for any fiscal year shall not exceed 
        $250,000,000.
            (B) If, during any fiscal year, the Secretary estimates 
        that the amount of funds necessary to pay the costs of training 
        approved under this section will exceed the amount of the 
        limitation imposed under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall 
        decide how the portion of such limitation that has not been 
        expended at the time of such estimate is to be apportioned 
        among the States for the remainder of such fiscal year.
            (3) Reasonable expectation of employment.--For purposes of 
        applying paragraph (1)(C), a reasonable expectation of 
        employment does not require that employment opportunities for a 
        worker be available, or offered, immediately upon the 
        completion of training approved under paragraph (1).
            (4) No double-dipping.--If the costs of training an 
        adversely affected worker or an adversely affected incumbent 
        worker are paid by the Commission under paragraph (1), no other 
        payment for such costs may be made under any other provision of 
        Federal law. No payment may be made under paragraph (1) of the 
        costs of training an adversely affected worker or an adversely 
        affected incumbent worker if such costs--
                    (A) have already been paid under any other 
                provision of Federal law, or
                    (B) are reimbursable under any other provision of 
                Federal law and a portion of such costs have already 
                been paid under such other provision of Federal law.
    (b) Qualifying Training Programs.--
            (1) In general.--The training programs that may be approved 
        under subsection (a)(1) include--
                    (A) employer-based training, including--
                            (i) on-the-job training,
                            (ii) customized training, and
                            (iii) apprenticeship programs,
                    (B) any training program provided by a State 
                pursuant to title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 
                1998,
                    (C) any training program approved by a private 
                industry council established under section 102 of such 
                Act,
                    (D) any program of remedial education,
                    (E) any program of prerequisite education or 
                coursework required to enroll in training that may be 
                approved under this section,
                    (F) any training program for which all, or any 
                portion, of the costs of training the worker are paid--
                            (i) under any Federal or State program 
                        other than this Act, or
                            (ii) from any source other than this 
                        section,
                    (G) any other training program approved by the 
                Commission, and
                    (H) any training program or coursework at an 
                accredited institution of higher education (described 
                in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
                U.S.C. 1002)), including a training program or 
                coursework for the purpose of--
                            (i) obtaining a degree or certification, or
                            (ii) completing a degree or certification 
                        that the worker had previously begun at an 
                        accredited institution of higher education.
            (2) Limitation.--The Commission may not limit approval of a 
        training program under paragraph (1) to a program provided 
        pursuant to title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 
        U.S.C. 2801 et seq.). The Commission is not required under 
        paragraph (1) to pay the costs of any training approved under 
        paragraph (1) to the extent that such costs are paid--
                    (A) under any Federal or State program other than 
                this Act, or
                    (B) from any source other than this section.
            (3) Reasons for not approving training programs.--The 
        Commission shall not approve a training program if--
                    (A) all or a portion of the costs of such training 
                program are paid under any nongovernmental plan or 
                program,
                    (B) the adversely affected worker or adversely 
                affected incumbent worker has a right to obtain 
                training or funds for training under such plan or 
                program, and
                    (C) such plan or program requires the worker to 
                reimburse the plan or program from funds provided under 
                this Act, or from wages paid under such training 
                program, for any portion of the costs of such training 
                program paid under the plan or program.
    (c) Supplemental Assistance.--The Commission may, where 
appropriate, authorize supplemental assistance necessary to defray 
reasonable transportation and subsistence expenses for separate 
maintenance when training is provided in facilities which are not 
within commuting distance of a worker's regular place of residence. The 
Commission may not authorize--
            (1) payments for subsistence that exceed whichever is the 
        lesser of (A) the actual per diem expenses for subsistence, or 
        (B) payments at 50 percent of the prevailing per diem allowance 
        rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations, or
            (2) payments for travel expenses exceeding the prevailing 
        mileage rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations.
    (d) On-the-Job Training Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission may approve on-the-job 
        training for any adversely affected worker if--(A) the worker 
        meets the requirements for training to be approved under 
        subsection (a)(1); (B) the Commission determines that on-the-
        job training--(i) can reasonably be expected to lead to 
        suitable employment with the employer offering the on-the-job 
        training; (ii) is compatible with the skills of the worker; 
        (iii) includes a curriculum through which the worker will gain 
        the knowledge or skills to become proficient in the job for 
        which the worker is being trained; and (iv) can be measured by 
        benchmarks that indicate that the worker is gaining such 
        knowledge or skills; and (C) the State determines that the on-
        the-job training program meets the requirements of clauses 
        (iii) and (iv) of subparagraph (B).
            (2) Monthly payments.--The Commission shall pay the costs 
        of on-the-job training approved under paragraph (1) in monthly 
        installments.
            (3) Contracts for on-the-job training.--The Commission 
        shall ensure, in entering into a contract with an employer to 
        provide on-the-job training to a worker under this subsection, 
        that the skill requirements of the job for which the worker is 
        being trained, the academic and occupational skill level of the 
        worker, and the work experience of the worker are taken into 
        consideration. Training under any such contract shall be 
        limited to the period of time required for the worker receiving 
        on-the-job training to become proficient in the job for which 
        the worker is being trained, but may not exceed 104 weeks in 
        any case.
            (4) Exclusion of certain employers.--The Commission shall 
        not enter into a contract for on-the-job training with an 
        employer that exhibits a pattern of failing to provide workers 
        receiving on-the-job training from the employer with--
                    (A) continued, long-term employment as regular 
                employees; and
                    (B) wages, benefits, and working conditions that 
                are equivalent to the wages, benefits, and working 
                conditions provided to regular employees who have 
                worked a similar period of time and are doing the same 
                type of work as workers receiving on-the-job training 
                from the employer.
            (5) Labor standards.--The Commission may pay the costs of 
        on-the-job training, notwithstanding any other provision of 
        this section, only if--
                    (A) no currently employed worker is displaced by 
                such adversely affected worker (including partial 
                displacement such as a reduction in the hours of non-
                overtime work, wages, or employment benefits),
                    (B) such training does not impair existing 
                contracts for services or collective bargaining 
                agreements,
                    (C) in the case of training which would be 
                inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining 
                agreement, the written concurrence of the labor 
                organization concerned has been obtained,
                    (D) no other individual is on layoff from the same, 
                or any substantially equivalent, job for which such 
                adversely affected worker is being trained,
                    (E) the employer has not terminated the employment 
                of any regular employee or otherwise reduced the 
                workforce of the employer with the intention of filling 
                the vacancy so created by hiring such adversely 
                affected worker,
                    (F) the job for which such adversely affected 
                worker is being trained is not being created in a 
                promotional line that will infringe in any way upon the 
                promotional opportunities of currently employed 
                individuals,
                    (G) such training is not for the same occupation 
                from which the worker was separated and with respect to 
                which such worker's group was certified pursuant to 
                section 103,
                    (H) the employer is provided reimbursement of not 
                more than 50 percent of the wage rate of the 
                participant, for the cost of providing the training and 
                additional supervision related to the training,
                    (I) the employer has not received payment under 
                subsection (a)(1) with respect to any other on-the-job 
                training provided by such employer which failed to meet 
                the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), 
                (E), and (F), and
                    (J) the employer has not taken, at any time, any 
                action which violated the terms of any certification 
                described in subparagraph (H) made by such employer 
                with respect to any other on-the-job training provided 
                by such employer for which the Commission has made a 
                payment under subsection (a)(1).
    (e) Eligibility.--An adversely affected worker may not be 
determined to be ineligible or disqualified for unemployment insurance 
or program benefits under this subtitle--

                    (A) is enrolled in training approved under 
                subsection (a);
                    (B) left work--
                            (i) that was not suitable employment in 
                        order to enroll in such training; or
                            (ii) that the worker engaged in on a 
                        temporary basis during a break in such training 
                        or a delay in the commencement of such 
                        training; or
                            (iii) left on-the-job training not later 
                        than 30 days after commencing such training 
                        because the training did not meet the 
                        requirements of subsection (c)(1)(B); or
            (2) because of the application to any such week in training

                group of employers to employ an individual upon 
                successful completion of the training; and
                    (C) for which the employer pays for a significant 
                portion (but in no case less than 50 percent) of the 
                cost of such training, as determined by the Commission.

                employment in the commuting area in which the worker 
                resides.
                    (C) The worker has filed an application for the 
                allowance with the Commission at such time and

        Commission, the Administrator of General Services shall provide 
        to the Commission, on a reimbursable basis, the administrative 
        support services necessary for the Commission to carry out its 
        responsibilities under this Act.
    (i) Review and Audit.--The Commission shall be subject to review 
and audit by the Comptroller General. Not later than 180 days after 
which all of the members are appointed to the Commission, and annually

                        the first or second calendar quarter following 
                        the calendar quarter in which the workers cease 
                        receiving such benefits;
                            (ii) the percentage of such workers who are 
                        employed during the 2 calendar quarters 
                        following the earliest calendar quarter during 
                        which the worker was employed as described in 
                        clause (i);
                            (iii) the average earnings of such workers 
                        who are employed during the 2 calendar quarters 
                        described in clause (ii); and
                            (iv) the percentage of such workers who 
                        obtain a recognized postsecondary credential,

                        equivalent if combined with employment under 
                        clause (i), while receiving benefits under this 
                        Act or during the 1-year period after such 
                        workers cease receiving such benefits.
                    (B) Additional indicators.--The Commission and a 
                cooperating State or cooperating State agency may agree 
                upon additional indicators of performance for the 
                adjustment assistance program under this Act, as 
                appropriate.
            (3) Standards with respect to reliability of data.--In 
        preparing the quarterly report required by paragraph (1), each

    (i) Verification of Eligibility for Program Benefits.--
            (1) In general.--An agreement under this subchapter shall

        worker receiving benefits under this subchapter who is not a 
        citizen or national of the United States remains in a 
        satisfactory immigration status. Once satisfactory immigration 
        status has been initially verified through the immigration 
        status verification system described in section 1137(d) of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-7(d)) for purposes of 
        establishing a worker's eligibility for unemployment 
        compensation, the State shall reverify the worker's immigration 
        status if the documentation provided during initial 
        verification will expire during the period in which that worker 
        is potentially eligible to receive benefits under this 
        subchapter. The State shall conduct such redetermination in a 
        timely manner, utilizing the immigration status verification 
        system described in section 1137(d) of the Social Security Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 1320b-7(d)).
            (2) Procedures.--The Commission shall establish procedures 
        to ensure the uniform application by the States of the 
        requirements of this subsection.

SEC. 303. ADMINISTRATION ABSENT STATE AGREEMENT.

    (a) In General.--In any State where there is no agreement in force 
between a State or its agency under section 302, the Commission shall, 
through regulations, arrange under regulations prescribed by him or her 
for performance of all necessary functions under title II, including 
provision for a fair hearing for any worker whose application for 
payments is denied.
    (b) Final Determination.--A final determination under subsection 
(a) with respect to entitlement to program benefits under title II is 
subject to review by the courts in the same manner and to the same 
extent as is provided by section 205(g) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 405(g)).

SEC. 304. LIABILITY OF CERTIFYING AND DISBURSING OFFICERS.

    (a) No person designated by the Commission, or designated pursuant 
to an agreement under this subchapter, as a certifying officer, shall,

States, be liable with respect to any payment certified by him or her 
under this chapter.
    (b) No disbursing officer shall, in the absence of gross negligence 
or intent to defraud the United States, be liable with respect to any 
payment by him or her under this Act if it was based upon a voucher 
signed by a certifying officer designated as provided in subsection 
(a).

SEC. 305. FRAUD AND RECOVERY OF OVERPAYMENTS.

    (a) Overpayments.--
            (1) Liability for overpayment.--If a cooperating State 
        agency, the Commission, or a court of competent jurisdiction 
        determines that any person has received any payment under this 
        Act to which the person was not entitled, including a payment 
        referred to in subsection (b), such person shall be liable to 
        repay such amount to the State agency or the Commission, as the 
        case may be, except that the State agency or the Commission 
        shall waive such repayment if such agency or the Commission 
        determines that--
                    (A) the payment was made without fault on the part 
                of such individual, and
                    (B) requiring such repayment would cause a 
                financial hardship for the individual (or the 
                individual's household, if applicable) when taking into 
                consideration the income and resources reasonably 
                available to the individual (or household) and other 
                ordinary living expenses of the individual (or 
                household).
            (2) Recovery.--Unless an overpayment is otherwise 
        recovered, or waived under paragraph (1), the State agency or 
        the Commission shall recover the overpayment by deductions from 
        any sums payable to such person under this Act, under any 
        Federal unemployment compensation law administered by the State 
        agency or the Commission, or under any other Federal law 
        administered by the State agency or the Commission which 
        provides for the payment of assistance or an allowance with 
        respect to unemployment, and, notwithstanding any other 
        provision of State law or Federal law to the contrary, the 
        Commission may require the State agency to recover any 
        overpayment under this Act by deduction from any unemployment 
        insurance payable to such person under the State law, except 
        that no single deduction under this paragraph shall exceed 50 
        percent of the amount otherwise payable.
    (b) Fraud.--If a cooperating State agency, the Commission, or a 
court of competent jurisdiction determines that an individual--
            (1) knowingly has made, or caused another to make, a false 
        statement or representation of a material fact, or
            (2) knowingly has failed, or caused another to fail, to 
        disclose a material fact, and as a result of such false 
        statement or representation, or of such nondisclosure, such 
        individual has received any payment under this Act to which the 
        individual was not entitled,
such individual shall, in addition to any other penalty provided by 
law, be ineligible for any further payments under this Act.
    (c) Reversion to Treasury.--Any amount recovered under this section 
shall be returned to the Treasury of the United States.

SEC. 306. PENALTIES.

    Any person who--
            (1) makes a false statement of a material fact knowing it 
        to be false, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact, 
        for the purpose of obtaining or increasing for that person or 
        for any other person any payment authorized to be furnished 
        under this Act or pursuant to an agreement under section 239, 
        or
            (2) makes a false statement of a material fact knowing it 
        to be false, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact, 
        when providing information to the Commission during an 
        investigation of a petition under section 221,
    
shall be imprisoned for not more than one year, or fined under title 
18, United States Code, or both.
