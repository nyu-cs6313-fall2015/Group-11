	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas clinical trials are essential for improving our Nation’s health;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas economically disadvantaged individuals, the elderly, females, and ethnic and racial
			 minority groups, especially African-Americans, Hispanic or Latino
			 Americans, Native Americans or Native Alaskans, Asian or Pacific
			 Islanders, are underrepresented in clinical trials, thereby threatening
			 the applicability of trial results for the general population;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas minority groups account for more than 30 percent of the United States population, yet
			 collectively represented only 12.3 percent of all publically funded cancer
			 trials from 2003 to 2005;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a 2012 study supported by the National Cancer Institute found that in patients 65 and older
			 lower income predicted lower trial participation, even while being nearly
			 universally covered by the Medicare program;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a national survey of cancer patients found that 85 percent of respondents were unaware that
			 participating in a clinical trial was an option for them;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas cancer patients with annual incomes of less than $20,000 are 44 percent less likely and
			 those with annual incomes of less than $50,000 are 30 percent less likely
			 to participate in clinical trials than cancer patients with higher
			 incomes;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in a 2001 survey of African-American physicians, 93 percent of physicians cited lack of
			 patient awareness as a possible factor contributing to low rates of
			 African-American trial participants and 92 percent of physicians cited
			 mistrust of the medical community;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas lack of health insurance is a major concern for potential trial participants, with only 5.4
			 percent of all National Cancer Institute sponsored cancer treatment trial
			 participants being patients who choose to participate despite not having
			 health insurance;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a 2007 to 2011 study found that 53 percent of patients earning less than $20,000 were
			 concerned about how to pay for a trial, compared to 25 percent of patients
			 that earned more than $100,000;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the National Institute of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 requires applicants for Federal
			 research funding to provide a strategy for inclusion of women and people
			 of diverse racial and ethnic origins into clinical trials, but 21 percent
			 of studies having received Federal research funding since then have failed
			 to report sample sizes by racial or ethnic group; 64 percent did not
			 provide any analysis by racial or ethnic group; and 75 percent did not
			 report any outcomes by sex; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas increasing participation rates of underrepresented demographic groups in clinical trials
			 would give physicians and researchers greater confidence that the results
			 of those trials would apply as broadly as possible to all patients in the
			 population: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
