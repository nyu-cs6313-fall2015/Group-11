                               RESOLUTION


 
   Calling for the immediate and unconditional release of the three 
   kidnapped teenagers held captive in the West Bank, and for other 
                               purposes.

Whereas on June 12, 2014, three Israeli teenagers, Eyal Yifrach, Gil-ad Sha'er, 
        and Naftali Frankel, disappeared returning home from school in Gush 
        Etzion;
Whereas Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the teenagers were 
        ``kidnapped by a terrorist organization'';
Whereas Naftali Frankel holds United States citizenship;
Whereas the Israeli security services have prevented dozens of kidnapping 
        attempts, and Israeli officials have said that abductors' goals have 
        been to trade hostages for Palestinian prisoners;
Whereas the United States Department of State immediately condemned the 
        kidnapping of the three teenagers, urged cooperation between the Israeli 
        and Palestinian security services, acknowledged that ``many indications 
        point to Hamas' involvement'' and reiterated that ``Hamas is a terrorist 
        organization known for its attacks on innocent civilians and which has 
        used kidnapping in the past.'';
Whereas Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the kidnapped boys ``are 
        human beings and we are looking for them and we will hold their 
        kidnappers accountable whoever they are'', referring to the kidnapping;
Whereas Khalid Meshaal, head of Hamas, was quoted as saying that he ``blesses 
        the hands of those who kidnapped'', and ``if there is a confirmation 
        that a Palestinian group is behind the kidnapping, we should applaud and 
        take off our hats to them'';
Whereas the International Committee of the Red Cross has called for the 
        immediate and unconditional release of the three teenagers;
Whereas continual security cooperation between the Palestinian Authority 
        security forces and Israel is essential to preventing future violence 
        and incidents of kidnapping;
Whereas the Palestinian Authority recently announced a reconciliation agreement 
        between Hamas and Fatah, paving the way for a unity government supported 
        by Hamas; and
Whereas Section 7040 of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
        Programs Appropriations Act, 2014 (division K of Public Law 113-76) 
        states that no United States assistance is permitted for a ``power-
        sharing PA government that includes Hamas as a member'', or that results 
        from an agreement with Hamas and over which Hamas exercises ``undue 
        influence'', unless the President certifies that the Palestinian 
        Authority government, including all ministers, has recognized Israel's 
        right to exist and accepted previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) demands the immediate and unconditional release of the 
        three captives, Eyal Yifrach, Gil-ad Sha'er and Naftali 
        Frankel;
            (2) expresses its--
                    (A) unshakeable support for the State of Israel as 
                a Jewish and democratic state, with secure borders, 
                living in peace and security alongside an independent 
                Palestinian state;
                    (B) ongoing concern and sympathy for the families 
                of Eyal Yifrach, Gil-ad Sha'er, and Naftali Frankel; 
                and
                    (C) full commitment to seek the immediate and 
                unconditional release of the captives; and
            (3) reiterates its commitment to upholding the conditions 
        in United States law in regards to United States assistance to 
        the Palestinian Authority.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
