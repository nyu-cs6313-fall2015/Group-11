                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the Minnesota Lynx women's basketball team on winning 
     the 2013 Women's National Basketball Association Championship.

Whereas, on October 10, 2013, the Minnesota Lynx won the 2013 Women's National 
        Basketball Association (WNBA);
Whereas this is the second national championship for the Minnesota Lynx in three 
        years;
Whereas the Minnesota Lynx won every game in the post-season playoffs, beating 
        the Seattle Storm in the semifinals, the Phoenix Mercury in the Western 
        Conference finals and decisively beating the Atlanta Dream in the 
        Championship round;
Whereas more than 13,000 fans attended the home games at the Target Center in 
        Minneapolis to cheer on the Minnesota Lynx;
Whereas the Minnesota Lynx features three gold medal winning Olympians, Maya 
        Moore, Seimone Augustus, and Lindsay Whalen, as well as a highly 
        talented team of professionals including Rebekkah Brunson, Janel 
        McCarville, and Monica Wright; and
Whereas the Minnesota Lynx are only one of four WNBA teams to win multiple 
        championships, both times under the coaching guidance of Cheryl Reeve: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the achievements of the players, coaches, 
        fans, and staff whose hard work and dedication helped the 
        Minnesota Lynx win the 2013 Women's National Basketball 
        Association National Championship; and
            (2) recognizes the Twin Cities region and Minnesota which 
        enthusiastically supports the team and women's professional 
        basketball.
                                 <all>
