                               RESOLUTION


 
      Recognizing the sesquicentennial of West Virginia statehood.

Whereas 2013 marks 150 years since the United States admitted West Virginia as 
        the 35th State in the Union;
Whereas the sesquicentennial of West Virginia statehood is a truly momentous 
        occasion that allows all West Virginians to reflect on the State's proud 
        heritage and bright future;
Whereas the territory that is now the State of West Virginia was originally part 
        of the Commonwealth of Virginia;
Whereas, on May 23, 1861, Virginia voters ratified the Secession Ordinance to 
        leave the United States and join the Confederacy;
Whereas in June 1861, a group of pro-union Virginians met in Wheeling, West 
        Virginia, in what became known as the Second Wheeling Convention;
Whereas the Second Wheeling Convention declared all State offices in Virginia 
        vacant, and all acts of the General Assembly to be null and void by 
        virtue of its attempt to force ``the people of Virginia to separate from 
        and wage war against the government of the United States and against 
        citizens of neighboring states[.]'';
Whereas the Second Wheeling Convention created the Restored Government of 
        Virginia that sought to rebuild ties with the Union;
Whereas, on October 24, 1861, residents of the area that is now West Virginia 
        voted to approve West Virginia statehood;
Whereas President Abraham Lincoln issued a proclamation on April 20, 1863, 
        during the heat of the Civil War, admitting West Virginia to the Union;
Whereas West Virginia formally joined the Union on June 20, 1863; and
Whereas President Lincoln recognized the importance of West Virginia's admission 
        to the Union by writing ``[T]he admission of the new state, turns that 
        much slave soil to free; and thus, is a certain, and irrevocable 
        encroachment upon the cause of the rebellion. The division of a State is 
        dreaded as a precedent. But a measure made expedient by a war, is no 
        precedent for times of peace. It is said that the admission of West 
        Virginia, is secession, and tolerated only because it is our secession. 
        Well, if we call it by that name, there is still difference enough 
        between secession against the constitution, and secession in favor of 
        the constitution. I believe the admission of West Virginia into the 
        Union is expedient.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the sesquicentennial of West Virginia 
        statehood; and
            (2) encourages all West Virginians to observe such day with 
        appropriate ceremonies and activities on this historic 
        occasion.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
