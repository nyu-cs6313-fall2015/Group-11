		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 62 percent of the children in foster care in the United States are age 10 or younger;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster care is approximately 2 years;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas for many foster children, the wait for a loving family in which they are nurtured,
			 comforted, and protected seems endless;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in 2013, nearly 23,000 youth <quote>aged out</quote> of foster care by reaching adulthood without being placed in a permanent home;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas every day, loving and nurturing families are strengthened and expanded when committed and
			 dedicated individuals make an important difference in the life of a child
			 through adoption;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a 2007 survey conducted by the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption demonstrated that
			 although <quote>Americans overwhelmingly support the concept of adoption, and in particular foster care adoption .
			 . . foster care adoptions have not increased significantly over the past
			 five years</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas while 4 in 10 Americans have considered adoption, a majority of Americans have
			 misperceptions about the process of adopting children from foster care and
			 the children who are eligible for adoption;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 50 percent of Americans believe that children enter the foster care system because of
