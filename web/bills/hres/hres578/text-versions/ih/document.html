                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of the week of May 11, 2014, through 
               May 17, 2014, as ``National Police Week''.

Whereas in 1962, John Fitzgerald Kennedy proclaimed May 15 to be ``Peace 
        Officers Memorial Day'', and designated the calendar week in which May 
        15 falls as ``National Police Week'';
Whereas law enforcement officers are charged with pursuing justice and 
        protecting communities in the United States;
Whereas State and local police officers, sheriffs, and other law enforcement 
        officers across the United States serve with dignity and integrity;
Whereas law enforcement officers serve as first responders to natural disasters 
        such as Hurricane Isaac and Hurricane Sandy;
Whereas law enforcement officers serve as first responders to terrorist attacks 
        such as the bombings at the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts, 
        and to accidents such as the fertilizer plant explosion in West, Texas;
Whereas the deadliest day in law enforcement history was September 11, 2001, 
        when 72 officers were killed while responding to the terrorist attacks 
        on the United States;
Whereas law enforcement officers selflessly risk their personal safety in the 
        interest of public safety; and
Whereas ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' honors law enforcement officers killed 
        in the line of duty: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Police Week'';
            (2) expresses strong support for law enforcement officers 
        across the United States for their efforts to build safer and 
        more secure communities;
            (3) recognizes the need to ensure that law enforcement 
        officers have the equipment, training, and resources necessary 
        to protect their health and safety while they are protecting 
        the public;
            (4) recognizes the members of the law enforcement community 
        for their selfless acts of bravery;
            (5) acknowledges that police officers and other law 
        enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice 
        should be remembered and honored; and
            (6) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``National Police Week'' with appropriate ceremonies and 
        activities that promote awareness of the vital role of law 
        enforcement officers in building safer and more secure 
        communities across the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
