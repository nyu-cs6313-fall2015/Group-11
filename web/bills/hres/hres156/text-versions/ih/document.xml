	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas the terrorists who attacked the United States of
			 America on September 11, 2001, were able to threaten and overpower crew members
			 and pilots on commercial airplanes in order to gain access to the cockpits
			 reportedly used box cutters, small knives, or razor blades;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist
			 attacks, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created to assume
			 control of the civilian aircraft security functions of the Federal Aviation
			 Administration and is currently tasked with providing security for the Nation’s
			 airports, maintaining a security force to screen all commercial airline
			 passengers and baggage, and working with the transportation, law enforcement,
			 and intelligence communities to ensure safety;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas every day, the TSA processes an average of 1.7
			 million passengers at more than 450 airports across the Nation and in 2012,
			 637,582,122 passengers relied on TSA screening to ensure that they safely
			 reached their destinations;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on March 5, 2013, the Transportation Security
			 Administration publicly announced its intention to permit passengers, effective
			 April 25, 2013, to bring previously banned items in their carry-on baggage when
			 boarding flights;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas prohibited items that would be permitted effective
			 that date include items that are potentially dangerous to passengers, flight
			 attendants, pilots, and Federal air marshals, and include hockey sticks,
			 lacrosse sticks, golf clubs, and, more alarmingly, small knives;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on April 9, 2013, the Nation was reminded of the
			 terrible harm that small knives can inflict on victims when a mass stabbing
			 occurred on the campus of Lone Star College in Houston, Texas, during which the
			 suspect used a razor utility knife and caused injuries, including lacerations
			 of the face and neck, to 14 people;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the TSA’s decision to allow these items was made
			 without a formal engagement process and without the consultation of members of
			 the Homeland Security Committee or its Subcommittee on Transportation Security,
			 the Aviation Security Advisory Committee, or the various stakeholders in the
			 air transit industry that will be directly affected by this change;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the American public, air travel industry
			 stakeholders, and Federal air marshals have expressed strong disapproval of the
			 impending Prohibited Items List changes, and their lives and well-being would
			 be placed in jeopardy as a result of the changes; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the $1,270,000,000 in estimated sequestration cuts
			 currently in effect at the TSA exposes the agency to vulnerabilities and facing
			 increased security risks due to potential furloughs, hiring freezes, and
			 layoffs of critical personnel, including transportation security officers and
			 Federal air marshals, as well as the elimination of the Crew Member Self
			 Defense Training Program: Now, therefore, be it</text>
