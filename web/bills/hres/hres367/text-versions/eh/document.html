H. Res. 367

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                    September 30, 2013.
    Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to take 
from the Speaker's table the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 59) making continuing 
appropriations for fiscal year 2014, and for other purposes, with the House 
amendments to the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House, 
without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the 
Committee on Appropriations or his designee that the House recede from its 
amendments and concur in the Senate amendment with the amendment printed in the 
report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. The Senate 
amendment and the motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be 
debatable for 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening 
motion or demand for division of the question.
    Sec. 2.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a two-thirds vote 
to consider a report from the Committee on Rules on the same day it is presented 
to the House is waived with respect to any resolution reported through the 
legislative day of October 7, 2013.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
