Recognizing the 200th anniversary of the Howard Flats Farm in Hornell, 
                               New York.

Whereas the importance of the agriculture industry on the economy of the State 
        of New York, and the United States as a whole, is indisputable;
Whereas as agriculture is a foundational part of the heritage of the United 
        States, it is important to recognize the accomplishments of those 
        longstanding farming families who have contributed substantially to the 
        vitality of the economy of their community and the State of New York;
Whereas the diversified farming operation at the Howard Flats Farm, owned by 
        Phil Bennett and his wife Juanita Bennett, includes a log home and 
        nearby camping site that is rented as lodging during hunting season and 
        throughout the year for recreational activities;
Whereas the Bennetts are active members of their community;
Whereas Howard Flats Farm spans around 700 acres of land;
Whereas the dairy operation at Howard Flats Farm has an average annual milking 
        herd of 150 cows;
Whereas the Howard Flats Farm in Hornell, New York, has been in the Bennett 
        family for five generations under the ownership of Daniel N. Bennett, 
        George Bennett, Bert Bennett, Byron Bennett, and Phil Bennett; and
Whereas Howard Flats Farm has and continues to change and expand with time and 
        is poised for success in the many years to come: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives proudly recognizes the 
200th anniversary of the Howard Flats Farm in Hornell, New York.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
