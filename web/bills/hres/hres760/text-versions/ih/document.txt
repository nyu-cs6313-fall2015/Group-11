                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of October 2, 2014, as World MRSA 
                                  Day.

Whereas MRSA is an acronym for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 
        which causes deadly infections in patients in health care facilities and 
        within our communities;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have estimated that 
        hospital-acquired MRSA infections alone killed more than 11,285 United 
        States residents in 2011;
Whereas patient and consumer organizations around the globe are lending their 
        voices to the call of world unity in leadership and commitment in 
        preventing and stopping MRSA, which is pandemic and spreading at 
        alarming rates;
Whereas leading patient and consumer advocates call upon health care officials 
        and leaders to step up and take a more comprehensive approach to 
        eradicate this preventable disease and focus on a broad and pro-active 
        prevention program;
Whereas as an integral part of its multi-faceted program, the MRSA Survivors 
        Network (the first consumer organization in the United States to raise 
        the alarm concerning the MRSA epidemic and other multi-drug resistant 
        health care-acquired infections) has announced ``World MRSA Day'', which 
        will be held on October 2, 2014, and is commemorated each year on 
        October 2, and has recognized the month of October as ``World MRSA 
        Awareness Month'' in order to call attention to this worldwide epidemic; 
        and
Whereas the MRSA Survivors Network has announced that April 1-7, 2014, has been 
        designated as ``International MRSA Testing Week'' in order to call 
        attention to this worldwide epidemic: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of World MRSA Day; and
            (2) supports the designation of International MRSA Testing 
        Week.
