  Supporting the goals and ideals of the Community Development Block 
                             Grant program.

Whereas the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program is a Federal 
        program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
        and provides direct grants to States and local governments for the 
        purposes of economic and community development;
Whereas the CDBG program was established under title I of the Housing and 
        Community Development Act of 1974;
Whereas this grant program was signed into law by President Gerald R. Ford on 
        August 22, 1974, and is among the longest running grant programs in our 
        Nation's history;
Whereas this grant program assists more than 1,200 State and local governments 
        each year;
Whereas this grant program allows grantees flexibility in tackling unique and 
        complex challenges facing their communities;
Whereas the CDBG program has invested over $145 billion in urban, suburban, and 
        rural economies since its inception;
Whereas CDBG funding is used to leverage other funds from the private sector, 
        non-profit organizations, and State and local governments;
Whereas every CDBG dollar invested in communities leverages, on average, $4.07 
        in other funds;
Whereas between fiscal years 2005 and 2013 this program has created or retained 
        approximately 330,500 jobs;
Whereas the CDBG program has funded public improvements benefitting States and 
        local communities;
Whereas between fiscal years 2005 and 2013, the CDBG program provided public 
        services to over 100 million people and assisted more than 1 million 
        households;
Whereas the CDBG program has been used to assist communities in the aftermath of 
        natural disasters and in the midst of economic crises; and
Whereas the CDBG program provides the largest amount of Federal assistance to 
        State and local governments for development efforts: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of the Community 
        Development Block Grant program, now in its 40th year of 
        continuous service;
            (2) recognizes the benefits the CDBG program has provided 
        to urban, suburban, and rural communities; and
            (3) acknowledges the importance of this Federal grant 
        program to States and local communities throughout the United 
        States.
