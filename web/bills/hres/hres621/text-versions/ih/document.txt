                               RESOLUTION


 
Reaffirming the commitment of the House of Representatives to the First 
     Amendment to the Constitution and the vital freedom of speech 
                 protections it provides for Americans.

Whereas the First Amendment to the Constitution, adopted on December 15, 1791, 
        provides that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment 
        of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the 
        freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably 
        to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of 
        grievances'';
Whereas the First Amendment has been and is a beacon of light and freedom to the 
        rest of the world in its protections to the American people from 
        overreaching by the Government;
Whereas, for more than two centuries, men and women have died to defend the 
        Constitution and the Nation's precious freedoms;
Whereas every member of the House of Representatives takes an oath to protect 
        and defend the Constitution;
Whereas the First Amendment provides broad freedom of speech protections to 
        allow individuals to participate in the Nation's representative 
        democracy;
Whereas amending the Bill of Rights would erode those precious freedoms that 
        strengthen the Nation's democracy; and
Whereas the masterful design of the Nation's Founders, in particular the authors 
        of the First Amendment, should not be tampered with or rewritten: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives reaffirms its 
commitment to the First Amendment to the Constitution, as written, and 
the protections it affords to the American people that are vital to the 
Nation's democracy.
                                 <all>
