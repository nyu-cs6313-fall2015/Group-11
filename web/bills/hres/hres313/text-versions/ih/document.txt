                               RESOLUTION


 
        Supporting the goals and ideals of the MAGIC Foundation.

Whereas according to the POSSUM (Pictures of Standard Syndromes and Undiagnosed 
        Malformations) database, there are more than 600 serious diseases and 
        conditions that cause growth failure;
Whereas conditions causing growth failure may affect a child's overall health;
Whereas short stature may be a symptom of a serious underlying condition;
Whereas growth failure in children is often missed;
Whereas according to the MAGIC Foundation for Children's Growth, 48 percent of 
        children in the United States evaluated with the two most common causes 
        of growth failure were undiagnosed;
Whereas the longer a child goes undiagnosed, the greater the potential for 
        damage and higher costs of care;
Whereas early detection and the diagnosis of growth failure is crucial for a 
        healthy future;
Whereas public awareness and education is a vital public service;
Whereas providing resources for identification of growth failure will allow for 
        early detection;
Whereas to this day, the MAGIC Foundation remains committed to its goals and 
        visions in helping to educate families and the public about growth 
        failure; and
Whereas the MAGIC Foundation has designated the third week of September as 
        ``Growth Awareness Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the goals and 
ideals of the MAGIC Foundation.
                                 <all>
