                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Speaker 
   should immediately request a conference and appoint conferees to 
 complete work on a fiscal year 2014 budget resolution with the Senate.

Whereas the House of Representatives and the Senate have each passed a budget 
        resolution for fiscal year 2014;
Whereas the Republican majority in the House of Representatives has repeatedly 
        called for transparency and regular order in the budgetary process, 
        including a statement by the Speaker on March 4, 2013, that ``It's time 
        for us to get back to regular order in the House'';
Whereas the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 sets a statutory deadline of April 
        15 for Congress to complete action on adopting a conference agreement on 
        the concurrent budget resolution, and the Congress is not in compliance 
        with the deadline;
Whereas the sequester threatens to impose sharp cuts in investments that are 
        essential to our economic growth, and should be addressed in a budget 
        resolution conference agreement;
Whereas a conference agreement on the budget resolution is necessary to set a 
        uniform discretionary allocation to facilitate the process of crafting 
        and enacting 2014 appropriations bills in a timely manner; and
Whereas the unresolved budget issues bring unnecessary uncertainty to the 
        economy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Speaker should follow regular House procedure and immediately 
request a conference and appoint conferees to negotiate a fiscal year 
2014 budget resolution conference agreement with the Senate.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
