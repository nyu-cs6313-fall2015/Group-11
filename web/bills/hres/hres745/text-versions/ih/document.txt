                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House that a Contract with America should 
                   restore American competitiveness.

Whereas Congress should conclude a Contract with America to restore American 
        competitiveness;
Whereas a Contract with America should include a roadmap to move American 
        competitiveness forward; and
Whereas Drs. Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin have developed an eight point plan to 
        restore American competitiveness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House that a Contract with 
America should include a roadmap to restore American competitiveness 
by--
            (1) simplifying the corporate tax structure with lower 
        statutory rates and no loopholes;
            (2) taxing overseas profits earned by American 
        multinational companies only where they are earned;
            (3) easing the immigration of highly skilled individuals;
            (4) responsibly developing America's shale-gas and oil 
        reserves;
            (5) aggressively addressing distortions and abuses in the 
        international trading system;
            (6) improving American logistics, communications, and 
        energy infrastructure;
            (7) simplifying and streamlining Federal regulation; and
            (8) creating a sustainable Federal budget, including 
        entitlement reform.
                                 <all>
