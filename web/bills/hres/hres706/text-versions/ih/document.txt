                               RESOLUTION


 
           Raising a question of the privileges of the House.

Whereas H.R. 1123, the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act, 
        was introduced on March 13, 2013;
Whereas the Committee on the Judiciary marked up and ordered the bill reported, 
        with strong bipartisan support, on July 31, 2013;
Whereas the suspension version of the bill included new language to prohibit the 
        bulk unlocking of cellular phones;
Whereas the changes made to the bill fundamentally altered the substance of the 
        underlying bill;
Whereas the report of the Committee on the Judiciary on the bill was filed in 
        the House on February 25, 2014; and
Whereas the bill was passed under suspension of the rules on the night of 
        February 25, 2014: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives disapproves of the 
actions taken by the Committee on the Judiciary and the leadership of 
the House of Representatives with respect to H.R. 1123 and directs the 
leadership of each committee of the House and the leadership of the 
House to operate in a matter that maximizes transparency and public 
trust.
                                 <all>
