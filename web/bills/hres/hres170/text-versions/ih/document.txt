                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the Falkland Islands referendum in favor of retaining their 
                status as a British Overseas Territory.

Whereas the Falkland Islands held a referendum on March 10, 2013, and March 11, 
        2013, to determine whether they wish to retain their status as a British 
        Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom;
Whereas the Falkland Islands, supervised under an International Observer 
        Mission, have voted 99.8 percent in favor of retaining their British 
        Overseas Territory Status;
Whereas the Falkland Islands have the right, under the United Nations Charter 
        and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to 
        determine their own future; and
Whereas the United Kingdom is a loyal ally that has stood by the United States: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the United States recognizes that the Falkland Islands 
        referendum reflects the freely expressed and democratic views 
        of the Falkland Islanders;
            (2) the Falkland Islands have expressed their desire to 
        remain a self-governing British Overseas Territory; and
            (3) the views and rights of the Falkland Islanders should 
        be taken into account in any discussion on the future of the 
        Falkland Islands.
                                 <all>
