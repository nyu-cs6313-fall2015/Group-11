        to freely determine their future, including their country's relationship 
        with other nations and international organizations, without 
        interference, intimidation, or coercion by other countries;
Whereas the Russian Federation has undertaken a campaign of political, economic, 
        and military aggression against Ukraine;
Whereas the Russian Federation's forcible occupation and illegal annexation of 
        Crimea, its continuing support for separatist and paramilitary forces in 
        eastern Ukraine, and its invasion of and military operations on 
        Ukrainian territory represent gross violations of Ukraine's sovereignty, 
        independence, and territorial integrity and a violation of international 
        law, including the Russian Federation's obligations under the United 
        Nations Charter and its commitments as a participating State of the 
        Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe;
Whereas the Government of Ukraine continues to exercise extraordinary restraint 
        in response to the invasion of its territory by several thousand 
        military personnel of the Russian Federation, who are engaged in 
        offensive military operations in support of separatist forces, the 
        illegal occupation and annexation of Crimea, and the tens of thousands 
        of Russian Federation military personnel positioned offensively on the 
        Ukrainian-Russian border since March 2014;
Whereas the forcible occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian 
        Federation and its continuing support for separatist and paramilitary 
        forces in eastern Ukraine are violations of its obligations under the 
        1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, in which it pledged to 
        respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of 
        Ukraine and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the 
        territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine;
Whereas the Russian Federation has provided military equipment, training, and 
        other assistance to separatist and paramilitary forces in eastern

        over 3,000 deaths, hundreds of thousands of civilian refugees, and

Whereas the Ukrainian military remains at a significant disadvantage compared to 
        the armed forces of the Russian Federation in terms of size and

        its territory against military aggression by the Russian Federation and 
        by separatist and paramilitary forces;
Whereas Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, a civilian airliner, was destroyed by a 
        Russian-made missile provided to the separatist forces by the Russian 
        Federation, taking all 298 innocent lives on board;
Whereas the Russian Federation has used and is continuing to use coercive 
        economic measures, including the manipulation of energy prices and 
        supplies as well as trade restrictions, to place political and economic 
        pressure on Ukraine;
Whereas visa, financial, and other sanctions imposed by the United States, the 
        European Union, and other allies and partners have placed significant 
        pressure on the Russian Federation and its leadership but have not been 
        sufficient to end its political, military, and economic aggression 
        against Ukraine;
Whereas the President of the United States has authority to impose stronger 
        sanctions against the Russian Federation and its leadership;
Whereas an aggressive Russian propaganda effort through the dissemination of 
        false information is intended to stoke ethnic divisions and incite 
        violence, thereby posing a direct threat to the peace and stability of 
        Ukraine;
Whereas on April 3, 2014, the President signed Public Law 113-96 for the purpose 
        of bolstering the resources of the Broadcasting Board of Governors to 
        counter Russian propaganda and provide the people of Ukraine and the 
        surrounding regions with access to credible and uncensored sources of

Whereas the United States supports the development of Ukraine's trade and 
        economic ties with other countries and especially the European Union 
        following the signing of an Association Agreement on June 27, 2014;
Whereas the United States strongly supports energy diversification initiatives 
        to reduce Russian control of energy supplies to Ukraine and other 
        European countries, including the development of domestic sources of 
        energy, increased efficiency, and substituting energy obtained from 
        Russia with imports from other countries;
Whereas the terms of the cease-fire announced on September 5, 2014, are being 
        violated by the Russian Federation and the separatist and paramilitary 
        forces it supports;
Whereas this cease-fire, if its terms are fully met by all parties, may be a 
        first step toward the reestablishment of stability that must include the 
        full withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territory, the 
        establishment of Ukraine's control over all of its international 
        borders, the disarming of the separatist and paramilitary forces in the 
        east, an end to Russia's use of its energy exports and trade barriers to 
        apply economic and political pressure on Ukraine, and an end to Russian 
        interference in Ukraine's internal affairs;
Whereas the political, military, and economic aggression against Ukraine by the 
        Russian Federation underscores the enduring importance of the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization as the cornerstone of collective Euro-
        Atlantic defense; and
Whereas the United States reaffirms its obligations under the North Atlantic 
        Treaty, especially Article 5, which states that ``an armed attack 
        against one or more'' of the treaty signatories ``shall be considered an 
        attack against them all'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) strongly supports the right of the people of Ukraine to freely 
        determine their future, including their country's relationship with

        Memorandum on Security Assurances, in which it pledged to respect the 
        independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine and to 
        refrain from the threat of use of force against the territorial
