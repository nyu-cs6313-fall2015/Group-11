                               RESOLUTION


 
  Congratulating and honoring Malala Yousafzai, recipient of the 2014 
                           Nobel Peace Prize.

Whereas the Nobel Peace Prize is an international award administered by the 
        Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden;
Whereas the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded for outstanding achievements in 
        peace since 1901;
Whereas the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a 
        group of five members appointed by the Storting, the Norwegian 
        Parliament, in Oslo, Norway, to recognize individuals who have ``done 
        the most or best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition 
        or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of 
        peace congresses'';
Whereas the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Malala Yousafzai, a 17-year-
        old Pakistani woman, for her courageous and tireless efforts to advance 
        gender equality in education;
Whereas Ms. Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel laureate in history, began championing 
        girls' education at only 11 years old and her advocacy has been the 
        subject of many documentaries and media reports;
Whereas Ms. Yousafzai has become a leading advocate for equal access to 
        education after a Taliban edict banning girls' education in her home 
        region of Swat Valley in Pakistan prompted militants to destroy hundreds 
        of schools;
Whereas Ms. Yousafzai survived a brutal assassination attempt while on her way 
        to school by Taliban gunmen in 2012 in response to her outspoken 
        campaign for the right to education for female students;
Whereas Ms. Yousafzai demonstrated incredible bravery by emerging more 
        determined to fight for the cause of education equality for female 
        students after the assassination attempt;
Whereas, currently, an estimated 13 million school age girls are deprived of an 
        education in Pakistan;
Whereas, to date, Pakistani girls' schools continue to be targeted by militants, 
        including through bombings and threats to teachers; and
Whereas Ms. Yousafzai's courageous campaign for equal education represents a 
        critically important effort in making the world a more peaceful place: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates Malala Yousafzai on receiving the 2014 
        Nobel Peace Prize, which is awarded for her outstanding 
        achievements;
            (2) honors Malala Yousafzai for her contribution to global 
        education equality and the promotion of peace;
            (3) states that in honoring Malala Yousafzai, it also 
        honors those who have promoted education equality including 
        those individuals who continue to champion the fundamental 
        right of all children to a peaceful education in Pakistan and 
        elsewhere; and
            (4) emphasizes that violations of human rights in general, 
        and the persecution of children specifically, are matters of 
        legitimate concern to all nations.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
