			 scholarship, dating back to 721 B.C.;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, as recently as 1940, Jews made up 25 percent of Baghdad's population;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in the 1930s and 1940s, under the leadership of Rasheed Ali, anti-Jewish discrimination
			 increased drastically, including the June 1–2, 1941, Farhud pogrom, in
			 which nearly 180 Jews were killed;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in 1948, Zionism was added to the Iraqi criminal code as punishable by death;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, throughout 1950–1953, Jews were allowed to leave Iraq under the condition that they
			 renounce their citizenship;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, as result of past persecution, few Jews remain in Iraq today, and many left their
			 possessions and treasured artifacts behind;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Ba'ath regime confiscated these artifacts, later dubbed the Iraqi Jewish Archive, from
			 synagogues and communal organizations;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on May 6, 2003, members of the United States Armed Forces discovered the Iraqi Jewish
			 Archive, which included 2,700 books and tens of thousands of documents, in
			 the heavily damaged and flooded basement of the Mukhabarat (secret police)
			 headquarters;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, under great urgency and before adequate time could be dedicated to researching the history
			 of the Iraqi Jewish Archive, an agreement was signed between the National
			 Archives and Records Administration and the Coalition Provisional
			 Authority on August 20, 2003, stating that the Iraqi Jewish Archive would
			 be sent to the United States for restoration and then would be sent back
			 to Iraq after completion;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, the Iraqi Jewish community is the constituency of the Archive and is now represented by
			 the diaspora outside Iraq;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, the current Government of Iraq has publicly acknowledged the importance of the Archive and
			 demonstrated a shared respect for the wishes of the Iraqi Jewish diaspora
			 by attending the December 2013 burial of several Torah fragments from the
			 Archive in New York;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas United States taxpayers have invested $3,000,000 to restore the Iraqi Jewish Archive, and
			 the National Archives and Records Administration has worked diligently to
			 preserve the artifacts;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the National Archives and Records Administration is displaying the Iraqi Jewish Archive in
			 Washington, DC, from October 11, 2013, to January 5, 2014, and in New York
			 City from February 4, 2014, to May 18, 2014; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Iraqi Embassy to the United States has said that the Iraqi Jewish community, like other
