                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the importance of dyslexia and other specific learning 
     disabilities and promoting research, education, and awareness.

Whereas this resolution may be cited as the ``Sydney Crawford Resolution'';
Whereas dyslexia is a brain-based learning disability that specifically impairs 
        a person's ability to read;
Whereas a specific learning disability is a brain-based genetic characteristic 
        that results in the imperfect ability to listen, think, speak, read, 
        write, spell, or do mathematical calculations, and often impacts overall 
        school success;
Whereas dyslexia is a specific learning disability;
Whereas common characteristics among people with dyslexia include difficulty 
        with phonological processing, spelling, and rapid visual-verbal 
        responding;
Whereas an estimated 10 percent of individuals have some form of dyslexia;
Whereas dyslexia is more common in boys than in girls;
Whereas specific learning disabilities are highly prevalent yet 1 in 20 public 
        school students are identified with them;
Whereas learning and attention issues often affect students who have a weakness 
        in a specific skill area, but it is important to recognize that these 
        students have strengths in higher-level cognitive functions, such as 
        reasoning, critical thinking, concept formation, and problem-solving;
Whereas dyslexia can be inherited, and recent studies have identified a number 
        of genes that may predispose an individual to developing dyslexia;
Whereas treatment for dyslexia should include modifying teaching methods and the 
        educational environment to meet the specific needs of the individual 
        with dyslexia;
Whereas dyslexia affects a wide range of people and produces different symptoms 
        at varying degrees of severity so predictions are hard to make;
Whereas the prognosis for individuals with dyslexia is generally good for 
        individuals whose dyslexia is identified early, who have supportive 
        family and friends and a strong self-image, and who are involved in a 
        proper remediation program;
Whereas current research avenues focus on developing techniques to diagnose and 
        treat dyslexia and other learning disabilities, increasing the 
        understanding of the biological and possible genetic bases of learning 
        disabilities, and exploring the relationship between neurophysiological 
        processes and cognitive functions with regard to reading ability and 
        learning;
Whereas great progress has been made in understanding learning and attention 
        deficient issues at a scientific level, including their epidemiology, 
        cognitive and neurobiological bases, and in the use of assistive 
        technology to improve access to learning;
Whereas early identification of learning and attention issues is critical and 
        must lead to focused, evidenced-based interventions, necessary 
        accommodations, self-awareness, self-empowerment, and school and life 
        success; and
Whereas enforcing existing Federal civil rights and education law on this matter 
        will improve access to learning for all: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of conducting research, 
        education, and awareness on dyslexia and other specific 
        learning disabilities;
            (2) recognizes that all people of the United States should 
        become more informed about and aware of dyslexia and other 
        specific learning disabilities;
            (3) recognizes the importance of acknowledging the 
        struggles and successes of those, like Sydney Crawford, who 
        live with dyslexia and other specific learning disabilities; 
        and
            (4) commends the excellent work of organizations dedicated 
        to dyslexia research to educate, support, and provide hope for 
        people with dyslexia and their families.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
