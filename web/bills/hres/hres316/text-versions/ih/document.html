                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing heartfelt condolences and support to the people of India and 
  all those affected in the aftermath of the deadly flash floods and 
landslides triggered by massive monsoons of June 2013, which devastated 
                     many states in northern India.

Whereas, in June 2013, flash floods were caused by the heaviest rains in 80 
        years, causing lakes, streams, and rivers to overflow throughout 
        northern India;
Whereas these torrential rains washed away homes, electrical poles, and roads 
        and triggered landslides that cut off communication links with large 
        parts of the states in northern India affected;
Whereas the flooding claimed thousands of lives, while tens of thousands are 
        still missing and even more are displaced;
Whereas rescue and relief efforts have been hampered by continuous rain, mist, 
        and fog;
Whereas these floods swept through many of the holy Himalayan pilgrimage sites, 
        including Yamunotri, Gangotri, Badrinath, Kedarnath, and Hemkund Sahib, 
        where thousands of devout pilgrims were traveling;
Whereas the full extent of the tremendous loss of life and extensive destruction 
        of property will not be known for some time;
Whereas the people of India have shown incredible determination to continue to 
        help one another despite the risks and have displayed selflessness and 
        compassion in the face of danger; and
Whereas countries around the world, international groups, and private citizens 
        have made a commitment to provide humanitarian assistance and aid for 
        the people of India: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) mourns with the people of India and all regions 
        affected by the loss of life and damage caused by the deadly 
        flash floods and landslides triggered by massive monsoons of 
        June 2013, which devastated many states in northern India;
            (2) offers its deepest condolences and sympathy to the 
        individuals and families impacted by this tragedy; and
            (3) urges the United States Government to stand with the 
        government and the people of India during recovery and 
        reconstruction efforts.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
