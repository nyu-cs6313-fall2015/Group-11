                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of October 2013 as ``National Anti-
                           Bullying Month''.

Whereas judgment and discrimination against others may be based on many factors 
        and may be based on a person's race, ethnicity, physical, mental or 
        emotional ability status, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, 
        religion, or age;
Whereas bullying is the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to 
        hurt another person that involves a real or perceived imbalance of 
        power;
Whereas bullying includes harassment that may occur in the workplace, at 
        schools, in families, in social settings, and online;
Whereas discrimination and bullying have direct effects on the physical, 
        emotional, and mental health of an individual, on organizational 
        stability in schools and businesses, and on the well-being of society as 
        a whole;
Whereas a disproportionate number of individuals with disabilities, African-
        Americans, Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Native Americans, and 
        members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community report 
        experiencing daily discrimination;
Whereas 1 in 5 elders have experienced hostile animosity from their peers in a 
        group setting;
Whereas more than 500,000 reported accounts and millions of unreported accounts 
        of elder abuse occur in homes, in relatives' homes, and in facilities 
        responsible for their care;
Whereas 37 percent of people in the United States report being bullied on the 
        job;
Whereas 160,000 children around the United States stay home from school each day 
        because of bullying and fear of bullying;
Whereas in 80 percent of school shooting cases in the 1990s, the shooters had 
        histories of being bullied;
Whereas 80 percent of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender teenagers reported 
        being bullied at school;
Whereas more than 50 percent of adolescents and teenagers report being bullied 
        online and bullying others online;
Whereas people of all ages, groups, and backgrounds may be victims of bullying, 
        marginalization, and discrimination, and bullying may lead to or worsen 
        depression, anxiety, and social isolation, which can lead to thoughts of 
        suicide or suicidal behavior; and
Whereas October 2013 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National 
        Anti-Bullying Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``National Anti-Bullying Month'' in order to acknowledge 
the harmful impact of bullying and of judging others based on 
appearance or group affiliation and to promote respect and support 
everyone's right to be who he or she is without being shamed, judged, 
or attacked.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
