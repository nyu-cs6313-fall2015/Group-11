                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of the month of May as Williams 
                       Syndrome Awareness Month.

Whereas Williams syndrome is a rare genetic condition that is present at birth, 
        affects as many as 30,000 individuals in the United States and is 
        characterized by lifelong medical problems, including cardiovascular 
        disease, developmental delays, and learning disabilities;
Whereas more than 5,000 individuals have signed a petition requesting that 
        Congress support the Williams Syndrome Association's efforts to 
        designate May as Williams Syndrome Awareness Month;
Whereas the Williams Syndrome Association (WSA), founded in 1982, is a non-
        profit organization and the most comprehensive resource for people and 
        families living with Williams syndrome as well as for doctors, 
        researchers and educators. And through its efforts, from raising public 
        awareness, to funding critical new research, and providing valuable 
        information and support to families, the WSA has improved the quality of 
        life and futures of those affected by Williams syndrome;
Whereas to generate awareness about Williams syndrome and raise funding for 
        critical WSA programs and initiatives, the WSA has organized May as 
        Williams Syndrome Awareness Month which includes ``Walks for Williams'' 
        and other events all across the United States; and
Whereas the Williams Syndrome Association and the families and friends of those 
        with Williams should be commended for their hard work, compassion, and 
        courage for educating the country about this rare disorder: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the goals and 
ideals of Williams Syndrome Awareness Month.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
