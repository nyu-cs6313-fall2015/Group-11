Whereas Senator Bullard made history by becoming the first woman to represent 
        the 118th District in the Florida House of Representatives;
Whereas Senator Bullard was a strong advocate for her constituents, representing 
        the families of South Florida with passion and integrity, standing up 
        for the issues that she believed in and offering inspiration to many;
Whereas Senator Bullard's legislative accomplishments include the passage of the 
        Good Samaritan Act, which strengthened protections for people who give 
        reasonable assistance to others during an emergency, the State 
        Facilities/Emergency Shelters Act, which authorized usage of additional

        which designated the Key Lime Pie as the official pie of the State of 
        Florida;
Whereas Senator Bullard worked like a Trojan to help rebuild South Miami-Dade 
        County following Hurricane Andrew;
