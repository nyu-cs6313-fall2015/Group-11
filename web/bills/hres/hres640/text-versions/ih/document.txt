                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of ``Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness 
                                Week''.

Whereas Helen Keller was one of the most accomplished, respected, and renowned 
        Americans who was deaf-blind;
Whereas the loss of both vision and hearing, one of the most severe of all 
        disabilities, affects approximately 1.2 million people in the United 
        States;
Whereas more than 34 million Americans have hearing loss;
Whereas approximately 21 million Americans have vision problems;
Whereas approximately 80 million Americans have potentially blinding eye 
        diseases;
Whereas there are approximately 59,300 legally blind children in the United 
        States;
Whereas today, people who are deaf-blind are attending college, participating in 
        social activities, managing their everyday lives and actively engaged in 
        their community through employment and civic activities;
Whereas it is highly appropriate and necessary to publicize the abilities and 
        potential of our fellow citizens who are deaf-blind, or who have severe 
        vision and hearing loss, and to recognize Helen Keller as a guiding 
        example of courage, hope, determination, and achievement for other 
        individuals who are deaf-blind;
Whereas in 1984, responding to the need for more awareness about the Deaf-Blind 
        community, Congress passed a resolution marking the last week in June as 
        Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week;
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes June 22-28, 2014, as Helen 
        Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week; and
Whereas the theme of the Helen Keller Deaf-Blind Awareness Week of 2014 is 
        ``She's Deaf-Blind and, with technology, she holds the world in her 
        hands . . . just like her loved ones'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Helen Keller Deaf-
        Blind Awareness Week; and
            (2) recognizes and honors people who are Deaf-Blind and 
        organizations in the United States, such as the Helen Keller 
        National Center, which continue to promote the awareness and 
        needs of the Deaf-Blind Community.
