                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Brotherhood of 
 Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, and congratulating the members and 
 officers of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen for 
                     the union's many achievements.

Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen is the oldest rail 
        union in North America;
Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen was founded on May 
        8, 1863, as the Brotherhood of the Footboard, a secret, fraternal labor 
        organization, and its first meetings were held in secret for fear of 
        reprisals;
Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen began to thrive 
        despite the climate into which it was born;
Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen has grown from its 
        original 13 members to 55,000 active and retired members located 
        throughout the United States;
Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen's members have 
        contributed, both directly through their railroad activity and in their 
        private capacities, to the war effort in all of the wars of the United 
        States since its founding;
Whereas the efforts of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen to 
        improve rail safety for both their members and the public have resulted 
        in a dramatic decrease in the number of railroad accidents in the years 
        since the union's inception;
Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen enlarged its 
        membership ranks to include other rail employees;
Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers merged with the International 
        Brotherhood of Teamsters effective January 1, 2004, becoming the 
        founding member of the Teamsters Rail Conference, and was renamed the 
        Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen;
Whereas in addition to providing representation for its members, the Brotherhood 
        of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen aggressively participates in the 
        labor movement with other unions and organizations to promote the 
        interests of working men and women and their families;
Whereas the 55,000 men and women of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and 
        Trainmen are highly trained professionals, and it is through their 
        professionalism, perseverance, and dedication that the railroad 
        industry, the lifeblood of the United States economy, runs smoothly and 
        safely 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year;
Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, working with the 
        International Brotherhood of Teamsters, is an extraordinary union whose 
        leadership continues to work hard every day, just as it did in 1863, to 
        protect members' health and safety, to guard their financial interests, 
        to give them an effective voice on the job, and to ensure dignity, 
        respect, and security for railway workers in the workplace; and
Whereas the efforts of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen 
        deserve the attention and admiration of the people of the United States: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the 150th anniversary of the founding of the 
        Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen;
            (2) congratulates the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers 
        and Trainmen for its many achievements and the strength of its 
        membership;
            (3) recognizes the tremendous contributions made by the 
        Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen to the 
        structural development and building of the United States and 
        for the many improvements in the well-being of tens of 
        thousands of workers; and
            (4) expects that the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers 
        and Trainmen will continue its outstanding work and will have 
        an even greater impact in the 21st century and beyond, and will 
        further enhance the standard of living and improve the work 
        environment for rail workers and other laborers for generations 
        to come.
