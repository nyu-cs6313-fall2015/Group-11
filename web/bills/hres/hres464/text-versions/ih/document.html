                               RESOLUTION


 
  Honoring the victims of the Cambodian genocide that took place from 
                      April 1975 to January 1979.

Whereas beginning in April 1975 and ending in January 1979, at least 1,700,000 
        to 3,000,000 people were deliberately and systematically killed in 
        Cambodia in one of the worst human tragedies of the modern era;
Whereas in 1975, Pol Pot led the Communist guerilla group, the Khmer Rouge, in a 
        large-scale insurgency in Cambodia that resulted in the removal of 
        Cambodians from their homes and into labor camps in an attempt to 
        restructure Khmer society;
Whereas traditional Khmer culture and society were systematically destroyed, 
        including the destruction of temples, schools, hospitals, and other 
        buildings;
Whereas families were separated in an attempt by the Khmer Rouge to prevent 
        family formation, many individuals were punished or killed for 
        education, wealth, or sophistication, and doctors, nurses, clergy, 
        teachers, business owners, artisans, city dwellers, and even those 
        individuals who wore glasses were singled out for execution since they 
        were seen as bourgeois or contaminated with Western influence;
Whereas the Khmer Rouge maintained control by mass public torture, executions, 
        and dismantling of the social order;
Whereas men, women, and children were sent to labor camps and forced to do 
        strenuous farm work and famine and disease became epidemic while 
        medicine and medical care were non-existent;
Whereas after the Khmer Rouge regime was overthrown in 1979, thousands of 
        Cambodians fled on foot to refugee camps in Thailand and many refugees 
        were processed again in other camps in the Philippines and Indonesia;
Whereas from these refugee camps hundreds of thousands of Cambodians made their 
        way to the United States beginning in 1975;
Whereas these Cambodians were subsequently resettled in communities across the 
        United States;
Whereas according to the United States Bureau of the Census figures from the 
        2012 American Community Survey, there are approximately 255,772 
        Cambodians currently living in the United States;
Whereas despite their tremendous loss, Cambodians and Cambodian-Americans have 
        shown courage and resiliency;
Whereas the memory of those Cambodians who were killed during the Cambodian 
        genocide must never be forgotten and the survivors of the Cambodian 
        genocide should be honored;
Whereas the resettlement of Cambodians reflected the hard work of voluntary 
        agencies through funding by the Federal Government, individual citizens, 
        and Federal, State, and local governmental agencies, all working 
        together to assist the new arrivals in adjusting to society in the 
        United States;
Whereas Cambodian refugees have done much to further successful resettlement in 
        the United States, including through mutual assistance associations 
        organized by previously resettled Southeast Asian refugees to help new 
        refugees through the provision of essential social, psychological, 
        cultural, educational, and economic services; and
Whereas while remembering and honoring both their traditional culture and their 
        traumatic past, the new generation of Cambodian-Americans is 
        contributing to United States society in meaningful ways: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors the victims of the genocide in Cambodia that 
        took place beginning in April 1975 and ending in January 1979; 
        and
            (2) continues to support efforts to pursue justice for the 
        victims of the Cambodian genocide.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
