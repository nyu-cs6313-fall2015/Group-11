                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting ``United States Foreign Service Day'' in recognition of the 
men and women who have served, or are presently serving, in the Foreign 
Service of the United States, and to honor those in the Foreign Service 
            who have given their lives in the line of duty.

Whereas the Foreign Service of the United States (referred to in this resolution 
        as the ``Foreign Service'') was established through the passage of the 
        Act entitled ``An Act For the reorganization and improvement of the 
        Foreign Service of the United States, and for other purposes'' (43 Stat. 
        140, chapter 182, commonly known as the ``Rogers Act of 1924'') and is 
        now celebrating its 90th anniversary;
Whereas the Rogers Act of 1924 established a career organization based on 
        competitive examination and merit promotion;
Whereas approximately 16,000 men and women of the Foreign Service are serving at 
        home and abroad in 2014;
Whereas the diplomatic, consular, communications, trade, development, security, 
        and numerous other functions these men and women perform constitute the 
        first and most cost-effective instrument of our Nation to protect and 
        promote United States interests abroad;
Whereas the men and women of the Foreign Service and their families are 
        increasingly exposed to risks and danger, even in times of peace, and 
        many have died in the service of their country;
Whereas employees of the Foreign Service work daily--

    (1) to preserve peace and freedom around the world;

    (2) to promote economic prosperity and mutual understanding around the 
world;

    (3) to reduce poverty, end hunger and malnutrition, fight disease, 
combat international crime and illegal drugs, and address environmental 
degradation;

    (4) to promote economic development, commercial enterprises, economic 
prosperity, global food security, American agricultural products, and 
United States jobs and trade;

    (5) to promote American ideals and values, human rights, freedom, 
gender equality, and democracy; and

    (6) to provide emergency and humanitarian assistance to respond to 
crises around the globe;

Whereas employees of the Foreign Service are often the first line of defense 
        against international terrorism;
Whereas more than 250 members of the Foreign Service, and many more locally 
        employed staff of the Foreign Service, have made the ultimate sacrifice 
        on behalf of the United States;
Whereas employees of the Foreign Service personify the virtues of patriotism, 
        sacrifice, service, and duty;
Whereas the families of employees of the Foreign Service make important and 
        significant sacrifices for the greater good of the American people and 
        the United States; and
Whereas it is appropriate and just for our Nation--

    (1) to recognize the dedication of the men and women of the Foreign 
Service; and

    (2) to honor those who have given their lives in the loyal pursuit of 
their duties and responsibilities representing the interests of the United 
States and its citizens: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors the men and women who have served, or are 
        presently serving, in the Foreign Service for their dedicated 
        and important service to country;
            (2) calls on the people of the United States to reflect on 
        the service and sacrifice of past, present, and future 
        employees of the Foreign Service, wherever they serve, with 
        appropriate ceremonies and activities; and
            (3) supports United States Foreign Service Day to 
        commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Foreign Service.
                                 <all>
