                               RESOLUTION


 
Calling for free and fair elections in Ukraine, and for other purposes.

Whereas democracy, human rights, and civil liberties are universal values and 
        fundamental principles of the foreign policy of the United States;
Whereas an essential element of democratic self-government is for leaders to be 
        chosen and regularly held accountable through elections that are 
        organized and conducted in a manner that is free, fair, inclusive, and 
        consistent with international standards;
Whereas governments in which power does not derive from free and fair elections 
        lack democratic legitimacy;
Whereas elections in Ukraine have previously involved restrictions on freedom of 
        expression, assembly, and association, including censorship, 
        surveillance, lack of transparency, and the absence of a free media;
Whereas, on February 22, 2014, the Ukrainian Parliament voted under its 
        constitutional authority to remove Victor Yanukovych from the post of 
        President of Ukraine; and
Whereas authorities in Ukraine have called for a Presidential election to be 
        held on May 25, 2014: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) greatly values the warm and close relationship the 
        United States has established with Ukraine since that country 
        regained its independence in 1991;
            (2) reaffirms the commitment of the United States to 
        democracy, human rights, civil liberties, and the rule of law, 
        including the universal rights of freedom of assembly, freedom 
        of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of association;
            (3) expresses support for freedom, human rights, civil 
        liberties, and rule of law in Ukraine, and for elections that 
        are free and fair;
            (4) expresses strong support for the people of Ukraine in 
        their peaceful calls for a representative and responsive 
        democratic government that respects human rights, civil 
        liberties, and the rule of law;
            (5) condemns the interference of foreign agitators in pre-
        election activities that have disrupted security throughout 
        Ukraine;
            (6) calls on the Government of Ukraine to respect freedom 
        of expression and association by--
                    (A) holding elections that are free, fair, and 
                responsive to the people of Ukraine, including by 
                refraining from disqualifying candidates for political 
                reasons; and
                    (B) ensuring freedom of the press, assembly, 
                association, and expression;
            (7) calls on the Government of Ukraine to allow 
        international election monitors to be present for the May 25, 
        2014, election; and
            (8) urges the President of the United States, the Secretary 
        of State, and other world leaders--
                    (A) to express support for the rights and freedoms 
                of the people of Ukraine, including to democratic self-
                government;
                    (B) to engage with the people of Ukraine and 
                support their efforts to promote human rights and 
                democratic reform, including supporting civil society 
                organizations that promote democracy and governance;
                    (C) to support policies and programs that preserve 
                free and open access to the press and Internet in 
                Ukraine; and
                    (D) to condemn elections that are not free and fair 
                and that do not meet international standards.
                                 <all>
