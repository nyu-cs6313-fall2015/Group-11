        Congress where he stated, ``Thomas Jefferson wrote that `governments are 
        instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the 
        governed'. It was a simple and important act of the human spirit. What 
        gave meaning to that act, however, was that the author backed it up with 
        his life. It was not just his words but it was his deeds as well.'';

Whereas after leaving office as president of the Czech Republic in February 
        2003, Vaclav Havel remained a voice on behalf of democratic dissidents
