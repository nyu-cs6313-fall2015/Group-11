                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Internal 
 Revenue Service (IRS) must allow taxpayers the same lame excuses for 
   missing documentation that the IRS itself is currently proffering.

The resolution may be cited as the ``Dog Ate My Tax Receipts Resolution''.
Whereas, the IRS claims that convenient, unexplained, miscellaneous computer 
        malfunction is sufficient justification not to produce specific, 
        critical documentation; and
Whereas, fairness and Due Process demand that the American taxpayer be granted 
        no less latitude than we afford the bureaucrats employed presently at 
        the IRS: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
unless and until the Internal Revenue Service produces all 
documentation demanded by subpoena or otherwise by the House of 
Representatives, or produces an excuse that passes the red face test,
    All taxpayers shall be given the benefit of the doubt when not 
producing critical documentation, so long as the taxpayer's excuse 
therefore falls into one of the following categories:
            (1) The dog ate my tax receipts
            (2) Convenient, unexplained, miscellaneous computer 
        malfunction
            (3) Traded documents for five terrorists
            (4) Burned for warmth while lost in the Yukon
            (5) Left on table in Hillary's Book Room
            (6) Received water damage in the trunk of Ted Kennedy's car
            (7) Forgot in gun case sold to Mexican drug lords
            (8) Forced to recycle by municipal Green Czar
            (9) Was short on toilet paper while camping
            (10) At this point, what difference does it make?
In any case, IRS can see the NSA for a good, high quality copy.
