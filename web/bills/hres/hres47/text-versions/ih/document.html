                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Citizens' 
  Stamp Advisory Committee, as an entity of the United States Postal 
Service, should issue a commemorative stamp in honor of the holiday of 
                                Diwali.

Whereas Diwali, also referred to as the ``festival of lights'', is an Indian 
        holiday that also marks the beginning of the Hindu New Year;
Whereas Diwali celebrates the triumph of good over evil, the awareness of one's 
        inner light, the dispelling of ignorance, and bringing peace and joy 
        through the awakening gained from this higher knowledge;
Whereas the holiday of Diwali is observed in America, and across the globe, by 
        Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, and Buddhists;
Whereas as one of the world's oldest religious holidays, Diwali serves not only 
        as a time for celebration, but also as a time for communities and 
        families to come together in spiritual enlightenment;
Whereas the practice of Diwali has survived political, economic and social 
        changes throughout history, while always carrying the universal 
        symbolism of the victory of light, goodness, knowledge, and truth;
Whereas the United States Postal Service, through the decisions of the Citizens' 
        Stamp Advisory Committee, has issued stamps for other popular holidays 
        in the United States, including Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, and Eid;
Whereas the United States Postal Service is yet to issue a stamp in honor of the 
        holiday of Diwali; and
Whereas issuing a postage stamp honoring the holiday of Diwali is fitting and 
        proper: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the United States Postal Service should issue a postage 
        stamp honoring the holiday of Diwali; and
            (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend 
        to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
