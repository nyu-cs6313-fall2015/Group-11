H. Res. 707

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                    September 18, 2014.
Whereas there is clear evidence of increasing incidents and expressions of anti-
        Semitism throughout the world;
Whereas on April 30, 2014, the United States Department of State released the 
        International Religious Freedom Report for 2013 and noted that, 
        ``Throughout Europe, the historical stain of anti-Semitism continued to 
        be a fact of life on Internet fora, in soccer stadiums, and through 
        Nazi-like salutes, leading many individuals who are Jewish to conceal 
        their religious identity.'';
Whereas anti-Semitic acts committed and recorded in 2014 around the world, 
        including countries in the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, and North 
        America, include incidents of murder at Jewish sites, violent attacks 
        and death threats against Jews, as well as gun violence, arson, 
        graffiti, anti-Semitic cartoons, and other property desecration at 
        Jewish cemeteries, places of worship, and communal activity;
Whereas a survey by the Anti-Defamation League of attitudes towards Jews in more 
        than 100 countries around the world, released in May 2014 found that 
        over a quarter of the people surveyed (26 percent), and nearly three 
        quarters of those surveyed in the Middle East (74 percent) hold anti-
        Semitic views, a stunning indicator of the stubborn resilience of anti-
        Semitic beliefs, even in countries where few Jews reside;
Whereas the Anti-Defamation League survey also found that a majority of people 
        surveyed overall have either not heard of the Holocaust or do not 
        believe it happened as has been documented by factual accounts and 
        recorded by history;
Whereas President Barack Obama said in his remarks at the USC Shoah Foundation 
        Dinner on May 7, 2014, ``. . . if the memories of the Shoah survivors 
        teach us anything, it is that silence is evil's greatest co-conspirator. 
        And it's up to us--each of us, every one of us--to forcefully condemn 
        any denial of the Holocaust. It's up to us to combat not only anti-
        Semitism, but racism and bigotry and intolerance in all their forms, 
        here and around the world. It's up to us to speak out against rhetoric 
        that threatens the existence of a Jewish homeland and to sustain 
        America's unshakeable commitment to Israel's security'';
Whereas in 2004, Congress passed the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act, which 
        established an Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, headed by a 
        Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism;
Whereas the United States Government has consistently supported efforts to 
        address the rise in anti-Semitism through its bilateral relationships 
        and through engagement in international organizations such as the United 
        Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
        (OSCE), and the Organization of American States (OAS);
Whereas in recent decades there has been a clear and troubling pattern of 
        increased violence against Jewish persons and their property, 
        purportedly in connection with increased opposition to policies enacted 
        by the Government of Israel;
Whereas during Israel's 2014 Operation Protective Edge aiming to stem the rocket 
        fire and terrorist infiltrations by Hamas, Jews and Jewish institutions 
        and property were attacked in Europe and elsewhere, including attempts 
        to invade a synagogue in Paris, fire-bombings of synagogues in France 
        and Germany, assaults on Jewish individuals, and swastikas spray-painted 
        in a heavily Jewish area of London and also in Rome's historic Jewish 
        quarter;
Whereas anti-Semitic imagery and comparisons of Jews and Israel to Nazis have 
        been on display at demonstrations against Israel's actions in Gaza 
        throughout the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America, 
        including--

    (1) placards comparing Israeli leaders to Nazis, accusing Israel of 
carrying out a ``Holocaust'' against Palestinians, and equating the Jewish 
Star of David with the Nazi swastika, and

    (2) demonstrations that have included chants of ``Death to Jews'', 
``Death to Israel'', or expressions of support for suicide terrorism 
against Israeli or Jewish civilians;

Whereas the Governments in France, Germany, and Italy, the three countries where 
        the majority of incidents have occurred, have strongly condemned anti-
        Semitism as unacceptable in European society and have all made clear 
        statements that such attacks on their Jewish communities are 
        intolerable, and they have matched those words with strong law 
        enforcement;
Whereas some civil society leaders have set strong examples, including the 
        condemnation by the Union of Mosques of France, on behalf of their 500 
        mosques, called the attacks ``morally unjust and unacceptable'', and 
        stated, ``nothing can justify any act that could harm our Jewish 
        compatriots, their institutions or their places of worship'';
Whereas the largest newspaper in circulation in Germany, Bild, featured 
        statements against anti-Semitism from politicians, business leaders, 
        civic leaders, media personalities and celebrities with ``Never Again 
        Jew Hatred'' on the front page; and
Whereas Congress has played an essential role in illustrating and counteracting 
        the resurgence of anti-Semitism worldwide: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) unequivocally condemns all forms of anti-Semitism and rejects 
        attempts to justify anti-Jewish hatred or violent attacks as an 
        acceptable expression of disapproval or frustration over political 
        events in the Middle East or elsewhere;
            (2) decries and condemns the comparison of Israel to Nazis as an 
        insult to the memory of those who perished in the Holocaust and an 
        affront to those who survived and their children and grandchildren, the 
        righteous gentiles who saved Jewish lives at peril to their own lives 
        and to those who bravely fought to defeat the Nazis;
            (3) applauds those foreign leaders who have condemned anti-Semitic 
        acts and calls on those who have yet to take firm action against anti-
        Semitism in their countries, to do so;
            (4) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the United States 
        Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as part of the broader 
        policy priority of fostering international religious freedom;
            (5) supports expanded Holocaust educational programs that increase 
        awareness, counter prejudice, and enhance efforts to teach the universal 
        lessons of the Holocaust; and
            (6) urges the Secretary of State to--
                    (A) maintain combating anti-Semitism as a United States 
                foreign policy priority;
                    (B) ensure that the instruments of United States public 
                diplomacy, including the United States Representative to the 
                Organization of Islamic Conference, are utilized to effectively 
                combat anti-Semitism;
                    (C) ensure high-level United States participation in the 
                2014 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) 
                high level event marking the 10th anniversary of the 2004 OSCE 
                Berlin Declaration against anti-Semitism;
                    (D) urge governments to ensure that adequate laws are in 
                place to punish anti-Semitic violence against persons and 
                property;
                    (E) continue robust United States reporting on anti-Semitism 
                by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and 
                Monitor Anti-Semitism;
                    (F) provide necessary training and instruction for personnel 
                posted in United States embassies and missions to analyze and 
                report on anti-Semitic violence against persons and property as 
                well as the response of governments to those incidents;
                    (G) ensure that United States Government efforts to train 
                law enforcement personnel and prosecutors abroad incorporate 
                tools to address anti-Semitic violence against persons and 
                property; and
                    (H) strongly support the Organization for Security and 
                Cooperation in Europe's specialized efforts to monitor and 
                address anti-Semitism, including through support for its law 
                enforcement and civil society training programs.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
