                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing the condolences of the House of Representatives to the 
 victims of the devastating landslide on March 22, 2014, extending the 
thanks of those who took quick action to provide aid and comfort to the 
  victims of the landslide, commending the resiliency of the affected 
communities for their strength, and committing to provide the necessary 
   resources and to stand by the people of the affected communities.

Whereas on March 22, 2014, a massive landslide near Oso, Washington, in 
        Snohomish County, destroyed homes, damaged public infrastructure, and 
        blocked the Stillaguamish River;
Whereas on March 22, 2014, the Washington Emergency Operations Center activated 
        and Snohomish County, Washington, and Washington State proclaimed a 
        state of emergency;
Whereas on March 31, 2014, Governor Inslee requested a major disaster 
        declaration;
Whereas on April 2, 2014, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 
        declared Snohomish County in the State of Washington, as well as the 
        Sauk-Suiattle Indian Reservation, Stillaguamish Indian Reservation, and 
        Tulalip Indian Reservation, as eligible for FEMA's Public Assistance 
        Program;
Whereas on April 2, 2014, President Barack Obama declared Washington State in a 
        state of major disaster and approved the request made by Governor Inslee 
        for Federal disaster assistance;
Whereas 43 people have lost their lives, and many more were injured that day and 
        in subsequent recovery and cleanup efforts;
Whereas within a matter of seconds, 1.3 square miles of earthen material rushed 
        down the mountainside, burying people in their homes under 40 feet of 
        mud, turning cars into scrap metal, depositing hazardous material and 
        other debris in the trees, river, and soil, and forever affecting the 
        lives of thousands of people;
Whereas in small rural towns such as Oso, Darrington, and Arlington, where this 
        landslide occurred, the impact of a disaster reaches far beyond the 
        number of individuals who lost a family member or whose property was 
        destroyed;
Whereas the landslide engulfed 42 homes completely, and many more homes were 
        damaged by flooding and debris;
Whereas crops such as hay, Christmas trees, pasture land, and dairies were 
        damaged;
Whereas sheep farms, and other livestock were lost;
Whereas this tragedy marks the third highest number of natural disaster related 
        fatalities occurring in Washington State ever, and the deadliest 
        landslide in its history;
Whereas the suffering and distress of these communities is ongoing, particularly 
        for those who lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods;
Whereas the local emergency responders, National Guard, FEMA, and many citizens 
        from the affected communities have risked their lives to save others;
Whereas the first responders in the affected communities, and countless 
        volunteers immediately came to the aid of those affected by the storms;
Whereas those in the community offered their homes, their time, and their 
        unwavering support to those affected;
Whereas many tribes, businesses, faith-based organizations, and other volunteer 
        organizations and charities have supplied the victims of the tragedy 
        generously with food, water, financial support, and shelter; and
Whereas hundreds of volunteers and government employees from across the United 
        States have committed time and resources to help with recovery efforts: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses condolences to the victims of the devastating 
        landslide on March 22, 2014;
            (2) extends thanks to the first responders, firefighters, 
        law enforcement personnel, volunteers, and medical personnel 
        who took quick action to provide aid and comfort to the victims 
        of the landslide;
            (3) commends the resiliency of the affected communities for 
        their strength; and
            (4) commits to provide the necessary resources and to stand 
        by the people of the affected communities.
                                 <all>
