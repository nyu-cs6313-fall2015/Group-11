                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the 
   Government of Mexico should forthwith repatriate Sgt. Andrew Paul 
  Tahmooressi from Mexican prison(s) and expressing the sense of the 
House of Representatives that the President of the United States should 
  take actions to impose sanctions on Mexico until such time as Sgt. 
                        Tahmooressi is released.

Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi served with the U.S. Marine Corps for two tours of duty 
        in Afghanistan earning a rare combat field promotion to Sergeant;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi was driving near the U.S.-Mexican border on March 31, 
        2014, when he took a wrong turn and unintentionally drove into Mexico. 
        He was stopped by police in Mexico and arrested for possessing three 
        firearms which were fully legal in Texas and were registered to him; and
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi has a distinguished record in the U.S. Marine Corps and 
        there is no indication that Sgt. Tahmooressi was in violation of other 
        laws in Mexico, except possession of his own firearms: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the Government of Mexico should expeditiously release 
        and repatriate Sgt. Tahmooressi and all possessions that have 
        been seized; and
            (2) the President of the United States should communicate 
        with the Government of Mexico that he will impose increasingly 
        harsh sanctions on Mexico until such time as Sgt. Tahmooressi 
        is released.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
