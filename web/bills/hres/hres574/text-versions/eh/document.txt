H. Res. 574

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                           May 7, 2014.
    Resolved, That because Lois G. Lerner, former Director, Exempt 
Organizations, Internal Revenue Service, offered a voluntary statement in 
testimony before the Committee, was found by the Committee to have waived her 
Fifth Amendment Privilege, was informed of the Committee's decision of waiver, 
and continued to refuse to testify before the Committee, Ms. Lerner shall be 
found to be in contempt of Congress for failure to comply with a congressional 
subpoena.
    Resolved, That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  192 and 194, the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives shall certify the report of the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, detailing the refusal of Ms. Lerner to testify 
before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform as directed by subpoena, 
to the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia, to the end that Ms. 
Lerner be proceeded against in the manner and form provided by law.
    Resolved, That the Speaker of the House shall otherwise take all appropriate 
action to enforce the subpoena.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
