                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of November 20 through November 26, 
2014, as ``End Child Slavery Week'' to raise awareness of human rights 
  abuses against children and to acknowledge the global fight against 
                     child slavery and child labor.

Whereas according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), child labor is 
        ``work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and 
        their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development'';
Whereas the term child labor refers to work that is mentally, physically, 
        socially, or morally dangerous and harmful to children and interferes 
        with their schooling;
Whereas the ILO estimates the global number of child laborers at 168,000,000;
Whereas the ILO estimates there are 85,000,000 children in hazardous work, which 
        could include mining and quarry work, agriculture, manufacturing, and 
        domestic work;
Whereas hazardous work is defined as work that directly endangers the health, 
        safety, and moral development of children;
Whereas the ILO estimates the global number of children forced into labor or 
        sexual exploitation at 6,000,000;
Whereas forced labor or sexual exploitation could include children chained to 
        looms to weave carpets, kidnapped to fight in adult wars, mandated to 
        leave school to pick cotton, or lured and sold to brothels;
Whereas the ILO estimates the number of children trapped in child labor since 
        2000 has fallen from 246,000,000 children to 168,000,000 children;
Whereas despite the decline by one-third of the global number of child laborers, 
        that decline is not enough to achieve the goal of eliminating the worst 
        forms of child labor by 2016; and
Whereas the United States agreed upon the goal of eliminating the worst forms of 
        child labor by 2016, as one of the ILO member states: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) applauds the work done by individuals, organizations, 
        and governments committed to human rights and the well-being of 
        children globally in decreasing the number of children trapped 
        in child labor by one-third since 2000;
            (2) recognizes that challenges that remain to eliminating 
        the worst forms of child labor by 2016;
            (3) urges the 183 member states of the International Labour 
        Organization (ILO) and worker's and employer's organizations 
        who agreed to the goal of eliminating the worst forms of child 
        labor by 2016 to continue with their strong efforts;
            (4) encourages consumers to continue to make their voices 
        heard that corporations should work to eliminate child labor 
        and slavery from their supply chains; and
            (5) reaffirms the commitment of the United States House to 
        the goal of eliminating child slavery and the worst forms of 
        child labor by 2016.
                                 <all>
