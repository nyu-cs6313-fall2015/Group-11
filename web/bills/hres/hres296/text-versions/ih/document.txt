                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that before the 
  United States ends its commitment in Afghanistan and United States 
   involvement in the conflict draws to a close, the Nation needs to 
ensure no one is left behind and all members of the United States Armed 
                       Forces are accounted for.

Whereas on July 7, 2013, the war in Afghanistan will enter its 142nd month;
Whereas as of April 30, 2013, a total of 776,055 members of the United States 
        Armed Forces have deployed to Afghanistan and spent most of their tour 
        there;
Whereas in June 2011, President Barack Obama announced his plan to begin the 
        withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan, changing the 
        mission from one of combat to one of support;
Whereas the number of members of the United States Armed Forces in Afghanistan, 
        which peaked at about 100,000 in June 2011, was reduced to a pre-surge 
        level of about 66,000 as of September 20, 2012;
Whereas currently roughly 64,000 members of the United States Armed Forces are 
        serving in Afghanistan;
Whereas levels of members of the United States Armed Forces are expected to fall 
        to 34,000 by February 2014, with the bulk of that drawdown to take place 
        in the winter of 2013 to 2014;
Whereas the United States has depended upon the service and sacrifices of 
        generations of courageous citizens to protect and uphold the Nation's 
        ideals;
Whereas the people of the United States and Congress have a responsibility to 
        support the troops that have been sent into harm's way, making all 
        efforts necessary to bring them home safely and expeditiously;
Whereas Army Sergeant Bowe Robert Bergdahl of Hailey, Idaho, the only known 
        United States Prisoner of War, was taken captive on June 30, 2009, and 
        still remains in Afghanistan; and
Whereas the creed ``Leave No Man Behind'' has long been part of the spirit and 
        culture of the United States Armed Forces: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
before the United States ends its commitment in Afghanistan and United 
States involvement in the conflict draws to a close, the Nation needs 
to ensure no one is left behind and all members of the United States 
Armed Forces are accounted for.
