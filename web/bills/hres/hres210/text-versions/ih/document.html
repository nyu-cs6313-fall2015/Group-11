                               RESOLUTION


 
      Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a 
  commemorative postage stamp should be issued in remembrance of the 
  victims and in honor of the veterans of the peacekeeping mission in 
                  Beirut, Lebanon, from 1982 to 1984.

Whereas on the morning of October 23, 1983, at approximately 6:20 a.m., a truck 
        packed with explosives broke security and detonated outside of the 
        United States Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon;
Whereas 241 United States Military personnel were killed in the blast;
Whereas a total of 273 members of the Armed Services from 36 States across the 
        United States were killed while serving in Beirut, Lebanon, from 1982 to 
        1984;
Whereas the servicemen were part of a multinational peacekeeping force;
Whereas the honor and sacrifice of the victims and veterans will never be 
        forgotten;
Whereas remembering those who lost their lives and those who served in Beirut 
        would enhance public awareness of the roots of the war on terror and 
        strengthen public resolve to rid the world of evil;
Whereas October 23, 2008 will mark the 25th anniversary of the Beirut bombing; 
        and
Whereas the Nation should celebrate the peace in the American spirit that was 
        embodied in the mission of these fallen heroes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the United States Postal Service should issue a 
        commemorative postage stamp in remembrance of the victims and 
        in honor of the veterans of the Beirut peacekeeping mission; 
        and
            (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend 
        to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
