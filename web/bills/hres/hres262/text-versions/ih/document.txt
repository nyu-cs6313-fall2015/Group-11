                               RESOLUTION


 
Calling for the immediate extradition or rendering to the United States 
of convicted felon William Morales and all other fugitives from justice 
who are receiving safe harbor in Cuba in order to escape prosecution or 
   confinement for criminal offenses committed in the United States.

Whereas William Morales, leader and chief bomb-maker for the terrorist 
        organization FALN, committed numerous terrorist attacks on United States 
        soil, including the bombings of Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan in 
        1975 and the Mobil Oil employment office in New York in 1977, which 
        killed 5 people and injured hundreds;
Whereas at least 79 fugitives from the United States, charged with offenses 
        ranging from hijacking to kidnapping to drug offenses to murder, are 
        believed to be receiving safe harbor in Cuba;
Whereas other fugitives from United States justice who are receiving safe harbor 
        in Cuba include Joanne Chesimard, who was convicted for the killing of a 
        New Jersey state trooper; Charles Hill, wanted for the killing of a 
        state trooper in New Mexico, Victor Manuel Gerena, on the FBI's list of 
        the ``Ten Most Wanted'' fugitives for carrying out a brutal robbery of a 
        Wells Fargo armored car in Connecticut, and Guillermo Morales, who was 
        convicted of illegal possession of firearms in New York;
Whereas according to treaties enacted in 1905 and 1926 (33 Stat. 2265, 33 Stat. 
        2273, and 44 Stat. 2392), the United States has a bilateral extradition 
        treaty with Cuba;
Whereas ``Extradition'' is the formal surrender of a person by a country to 
        another country for prosecution or punishment;
Whereas in January 2002, Cuba deported to the United States Jesse James Bell, a 
        United States fugitive wanted on drug charges;
Whereas in March 2002, Cuba extradited drug trafficker Luis Hernando Gomez 
        Bustamante to Colombia, and Gomez Bustamante was subsequently extradited 
        to the United States in July 2007 to face drug trafficking charges; and
Whereas it is imperative that Cuba abide by its extradition treaty with the 
        United States and immediately extradite or render to the United States 
        those legally indicted or convicted of serious criminal offenses in the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) calls for the immediate extradition or rendering to the 
        United States of convicted felon William Morales and all other 
        fugitives from justice who are receiving safe harbor in Cuba in 
        order to escape prosecution or confinement for criminal 
        offenses committed in the United States;
            (2) urges the international community to continue to press 
        for the immediate extradition or rendering of all fugitives 
        from justice that are receiving safe harbor in Cuba; and
            (3) calls on the Secretary of State and the Attorney 
        General of the United States to continue to press for the 
        immediate extradition or rendering of all fugitives from United 
        States justice so that they may be tried or, if convicted, 
        serve out their sentences.
                                 <all>
