                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the campaign of genocide against the Kurdish people in 
                                 Iraq.

Whereas during the regime of Saddam Hussein, Iraq conducted a campaign of 
        genocide against its Kurdish community, known collectively as the al-
        Anfal Campaign;
Whereas the campaign of genocide against Iraq's Kurdish community included the 
        deportation and disappearances of Kurds in the 1970s and 1980s and the 
        use of chemical weapons in the late 1980s, most notably at Halabja;
Whereas during this campaign of genocide almost 200,000 Kurds perished or 
        disappeared, families were torn apart, and 4,500 villages were destroyed 
        between 1976 and 1988;
Whereas this year marks the 25th anniversary of the attacks at Halabja when 
        Iraqi planes used poison gas to kill thousands of Iraqi Kurds in gross 
        violation of the international conventions against the use of chemical 
        weapons;
Whereas on March 12, 2013, the British Parliament passed a resolution 
        recognizing the campaign of genocide against the Iraqi Kurds; and
Whereas recognition of the campaign of genocide against the Iraqi Kurds by the 
        United States Government will send to the world a message of support for 
        human rights: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) deplores the campaign of genocide that was launched 
        against the Kurdish people in Iraq;
            (2) calls on the United States Government to recognize the 
        campaign of genocide that was committed against the Kurdish 
        people in Iraq; and
            (3) reaffirms its commitment to the friendship between the 
        United States and the Kurdish people in Iraq.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
