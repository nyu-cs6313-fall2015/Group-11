                              Anniversary.

Whereas the American Motorcyclist Association has been promoting and protecting

        among the Nation's most passionate enthusiasts;
Whereas through member clubs, promoters, and partners, the American Motorcyclist 
        Association sanctions almost 3,000 motorsports competition events 
        annually; and
Whereas the American Motorcyclist Association's headquarters in Pickerington, 
        Ohio, is home to the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame, which honors those who 
        have contributed to the history of motorcycling through political 
        activism, culture, and sport, and which preserves the heritage of 
        motorcycling for future generations: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives congratulates the 
American Motorcyclist Association on its 90th Anniversary and commends 
it for having promoted and protected the rights and interests of 
motorcyclists and motorcycle enthusiasts since 1924.
