  Recognizing the 96th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic 
                        Republic of Azerbaijan.

Whereas, on May 28, 1918, the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan was proclaimed 
        the world's first secular Muslim parliamentary democratic republic;
Whereas the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan was granted diplomatic recognition 
        by the United States and other democratic nations;
Whereas Azerbaijan granted universal suffrage in 1918, making it the first 
        majority Muslim country to give women the right to vote;
Whereas after the collapse of the Soviet Union the United States established 
        full diplomatic ties with the Republic of Azerbaijan in 1992;
Whereas successive U.S. administrations have expressed support for Azerbaijani 
        development of energy resources in the Caspian Sea region, including 
        construction of the landmark Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and the 
        Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline that are main arteries for delivering 
        Caspian energy resources to global markets;
Whereas completion of the Southern Gas Corridor will increase European energy 
        security by increasing the amount of natural gas flowing from the 
        Caspian Sea to American allies in Europe;
Whereas in a recent letter to Azerbaijan's President, Secretary of State John 
        Kerry wrote, ``Azerbaijan is becoming a new reliable member of world 
        energy resources and helps ensure Europe's energy security. The 
        implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor after a long hard work, 
        besides benefitting the consortium's numerous partners and neighbors, 
        will strengthen the independence of Azerbaijan'';
Whereas the Republic of Azerbaijan is an important strategic partner of the 
        United States, and Azerbaijani troops serve shoulder to shoulder with 
        U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan, as they previously did in Iraq and Kosovo;
Whereas Azerbaijan and the U.S. cooperate in countering terrorism, nuclear 
        proliferation, and narcotics trafficking;
Whereas Azerbaijan maintains close, friendly ties with Israel--America's vital 
        ally in the Middle East--and provides 40 percent of Israel's oil 
        consumption;
Whereas Azerbaijan is home to Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities and has 
        been praised for its religious tolerance by the European Parliament;
Whereas Azerbaijan's Jewish community has resided in Azerbaijan for 2,500 years 
        without persecution; and
Whereas Azerbaijan supports peace and stability in the Caspian Sea region: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) extends warm congratulations and best wishes to the 
        people of Azerbaijan as they celebrate Republic Day on the 96th 
        anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of 
        Azerbaijan;
            (2) notes the important role that Azerbaijan plays in 
        ensuring the energy security of Israel and other American 
        allies in Europe; and
            (3) expresses support for continued cooperation between the 
        United States and Azerbaijan on energy, security, and other 
        matters.
                                 <all>
