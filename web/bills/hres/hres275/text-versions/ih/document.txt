                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the funds 
 made available for the cost of the President's trip to Africa instead 
 be used to compensate those who have been placed on an administrative 
                 furlough as a result of sequestration.

Whereas, as a result of administrative furloughs, civil servants across the 
        country have had their regular salaries reduced;
Whereas the President and the First Lady are scheduled to travel to Senegal, 
        South Africa, and Tanzania from June 26 through July 3, 2013;
Whereas, when White House personnel are on official travel, certain personal 
        expenses, including per diem (food and lodging), car rentals, and other 
        incidentals, are paid by the Government; these expenses are paid by the 
        State Department for foreign travel;
Whereas most of the costs involve operational costs of the aircraft, and include 
        fuel, maintenance, engineering support, and per diem expenses for the 
        crew;
Whereas, in 2012, the United States Air Force indicated that the cost per hour 
        for the President's Boeing 747 (which is designated ``VC-25'' by the Air 
        Force) is $179,750;
Whereas President Obama's trip to Africa is estimated to cost $60,000,000 to 
        $100,000,000;
Whereas, in September of 1999, the Government Accountability Office estimated 
        that the estimated incremental costs of President Clinton's trips to 
        Africa was at least $42,800,000;
Whereas the President signed the Budget Control Act (Public Law 112-25), which 
        called for sequestration, on August 2, 2011;
Whereas sequestration took effect on March 1, 2013, and will cut 
        $984,000,000,000 over the nine-year period of 2013 through 2021;
Whereas, in 2013, there will be $85,000,000,000 in discretionary spending cuts, 
        which will equal between 5 percent and 13 percent of each agency's 
        budget, depending on the Federal agency; and
Whereas, in order to compensate for these budgetary cuts, some Federal agencies 
        have instituted administrative furloughs designed to absorb reduced 
        funding: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the funds made available for the cost of the President's trip to Africa 
instead be used to compensate those who have been placed on an 
administrative furlough as a result of sequestration.
