                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for designation of the month of September as 
                ``Clinical Research Innovation Month''.

Whereas Clinical Research Organizations (CROs) provide specially designed 
        services which are fundamental to the development of drugs, biologics, 
        and medical devices that improve the general health and well-being of 
        the people of the United States;
Whereas CROs have more than doubled in size over the past decade;
Whereas the number of studies conducted by CROs has increased by over 500 
        percent over the past 8 years;
Whereas CROs conduct 80 percent of the experimental research for innovative new 
        drugs;
Whereas CROs contribute more than 100,000 professional research jobs to the 
        global innovation economy;
Whereas these cutting-edge research organizations undertake approximately two-
        thirds of business activity for biopharmaceutical development, 
        demonstrating their critical involvement in the pharmaceutical, biotech, 
        and medical device industries;
Whereas of the 88 new drugs to receive Food and Drug Administration and 
        Emergency Medical Associates approval last year, 85 of them were 
        manufactured by CROs;
Whereas CROs research medical solutions to combat diseases such as breast 
        cancer, Alzheimer's Disease, hepatitis, diabetes, asthma, and 
        hypertension;
Whereas CROs have conducted thousands of clinical trials involving over 
        1,000,000 patients as they strive to tackle the world's most pressing 
        medical issues through innovative clinical research; and
Whereas the month of September would be an appropriate time to designate as 
        ``Clinical Research Innovation Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Clinical Research 
        Innovation Month'';
            (2) recognizes the considerable contributions of Clinical 
        Research Organizations to the United States; and
            (3) honors these organizations, which will continue to 
        inspire innovation in future generations.
