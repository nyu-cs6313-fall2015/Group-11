        founded Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc.;
Whereas the founders of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., a nonprofit 
        organization, wished to create an organization that viewed itself as ``a 
        part of'' the community rather than ``apart from'' the community, and 
        believed each potential member should be judged by his own merits, 
        rather than his family background, affluence, race, nationality, skin 
        tone, or hair texture;
Whereas the founders of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., wanted to organize a 
        Greek letter fraternity that would exemplify the ideals of brotherhood, 
        scholarship, and service, which is mirrored in the motto of Phi Beta 
        Sigma Fraternity, Inc., ``Culture For Service and Service For 
        Humanity'';

        and 650 chapters worldwide;
Whereas the mission and administrative theme of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., 
        is to represent ``one Fraternity working together to transform our 
        communities'', meaning the greatest contribution of Phi Beta Sigma 
        Fraternity, Inc., is to assure that communities are improved, enhanced, 
        and impacted holistically, resulting in stronger, healthier, and wiser 
        populations;

        materials;
Whereas Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., has supported vocational opportunities 
        globally through the Ghana School Project;
Whereas Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., has demonstrated leadership in the 
        effort to improve health care access and outcomes for men of color 
        through the Sigma Wellness: Living Well Brother-to-Brother Initiative;
Whereas Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., has remained an active and committed 
        participant in the democratic process by instituting Project Vote, which 
        continuously registers, educates, and encourages citizens to participate 
        in the democratic process;
Whereas the current members of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., inherit a legacy 
        built by former members who have left remarkable imprints in their 
        fields, including renowned scientist and inventor George Washington 
        Carver, writer and educator Alain LeRoy Locke, author and civil rights

Whereas Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., continues to make a difference in 
        United States and foreign communities, always following in the footsteps 
        of its founders and upholding the commitment of Phi Beta Sigma 
        Fraternity, Inc., to be great stewards of brotherhood, scholarship, and 
        service: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
