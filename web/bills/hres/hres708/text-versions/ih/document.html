                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of September 6, 2014, as ``Everett 
 McKinley Dirksen and Marigold Day'', and designating and adopting the 
flower commonly known as the Marigold as the floral emblem of Congress 
                        for September 10, 2014.

Whereas the great Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen of Pekin, Illinois, has 
        passed from the halls of the United States Capitol;
Whereas the current Members of Congress wish to honor Senator Dirksen;
Whereas, upon the passing of Senator Dirksen, his contemporaries and peers 
        stated that--

    (1) Senator Dirksen--

    G    (A) provided sage advice and counsel and wholehearted wisdom;

    G    (B) provided support that made the civil rights legislation of the 
1960s a fact rather than a dream during that decade; and

    G    (C) was known as an American who cultivated the chivalric virtues 
of public life, such as--

        G    (i) a love of combat in statesmanship;

        G    (ii) a high sense of honor;

        G    (iii) a practical acceptance of the standards of party 
loyalty; and

        G    (iv) the acceptance of political life as a game to be played 
according to the rules; and

    (2) when Senator Dirksen spoke, the country listened, and his eloquence 
was a source of national strength;

Whereas, as Senator Dirksen noted, unless some supernatural force disturbs the 
        procession of the seasons, there will be a spring, and when spring 
        comes, there will be flowers;
Whereas flowers are a wonder of joy brought forth by seed, sun, and soil, and 
        nurtured by rain, that let nature unfurl all her great beauty in every 
        color in the spectrum;
Whereas Senator Dirksen found himself wedded to the flower commonly known as the 
        Marigold, of the genus Tagetes, the rugged, robust, bright, and stately 
        flower that is somehow able to resist the onslaught of insects while 
        taking in stride extreme changes in temperature, fighting back the 
        scorching sun in summer and the chill of early spring evenings;
Whereas the peoples of the world have from time immemorial adopted emblems for 
        their institutions that represent their virtues;
Whereas, from time to time, the United States Congress has adopted emblems to 
        represent to the world the virtues of Congress and of the United States;
Whereas the Mace of the House of Representatives is one of the oldest symbols of 
        Congress and consists of 13 ebony rods that represent the 13 original 
        States of the Union;
Whereas the Seal of the Senate represents the 13 original colonies with a shield 
        comprised of 13 stars and 13 vertical stripes and a scroll inscribed 
        with ``E pluribus unum'';
Whereas the Seal of the Senate also includes--

    (1) an olive branch symbolizing peace;

    (2) an oak branch symbolizing strength;

    (3) a red liberty cap representing freedom; and

    (4) crossed fasces representing authority;

Whereas the Marigold represents the character of the House of Representatives 
        and the Senate more appropriately as an emblem than does any other 
        flower;
Whereas the Marigold is a native of North America and nowhere else in the world;
Whereas the Marigold is grown in abundance in the home gardens of every State of 
        the Union;
Whereas the Marigold is grown easily and quickly from seed in every State of the 
        Union;
Whereas the Marigold is acknowledged as a symbol of religious faith;
Whereas the Marigold in its very appearance represents not only beauty but also 
        a rugged humility of character; and
Whereas the Marigold, like the American eagle and the American flag, would be an 
        exclusively American emblem, unclaimed by any foreign country or 
        institution: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Congress--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Everett McKinley Dirksen 
        and Marigold Day''; and
            (2) designates and adopts the flower commonly known as the 
        Marigold, of the genus Tagetes, as the floral emblem of 
        Congress.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
