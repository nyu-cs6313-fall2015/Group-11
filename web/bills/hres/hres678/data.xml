Provides for the consideration of the bill (S. 815, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2013 [ENDA]) to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Sets forth an amendment providing that: (1) ENDA shall not change the requirements of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applicable to a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with carrying out the activities of such an organization; and (2) such organizations are not exempt from ENDA's requirements to refrain from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in the same manner as is required with respect to discrimination based on race, color, sex and national origin under such title.</summary>
