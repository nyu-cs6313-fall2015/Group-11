                               RESOLUTION


 
                   Recognizing Older Americans Month.

Whereas President John F. Kennedy first designated May as ``Senior Citizens 
        Month'' in 1963;
Whereas in 1963, only 17,000,000 individuals living in the United States were 
        age 65 or older, approximately \1/3\ of such individuals lived in 
        poverty, and few programs existed to meet the needs of older individuals 
        in the United States;
Whereas in 2014, there are more than 43,000,000 individuals age 65 or older in 
        the United States, and such individuals account for 13.7 percent of the 
        total population of the United States;
Whereas in 2014, more than 9,600,000 veterans of the Armed Forces are age 65 or 
        older;
Whereas older individuals in the United States rely on Federal programs, such as 
        Social Security, the Medicare program, the Medicaid program, and, in the 
        case of veterans, the TRICARE program and the health care system of the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs, for financial security and high-quality 
        affordable health care;
Whereas the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) provides 
        supportive services to help individuals of the United States who are age 
        60 or older maintain maximum independence in their homes and 
        communities;
Whereas the Older Americans Act of 1965 provides funding for programs, including 
        nutrition services, transportation, and care management, to assist more 
        than 11,000,000 older individuals in the United States each year;
Whereas compared to older individuals in the United States in past generations, 
        older individuals in the United States in 2014 are working longer, 
        living longer, and enjoying healthier, more active, and more independent 
        lifestyles;
Whereas more than 4,300,000 individuals in the United States age 65 or older 
        continue to work as full-time, year-round employees;
Whereas older individuals in the United States play an important role in society 
        by continuing to contribute their experience, knowledge, wisdom, and 
        accomplishments;
Whereas older individuals in the United States play vital roles in their 
        communities and remain involved in volunteer work, mentoring activities, 
        the arts, cultural activities, and civic engagement; and
Whereas a society that recognizes the success of older individuals and continues 
        to enhance their access to quality and affordable health care will 
        encourage the ongoing participation and heightened independence of such 
        individuals and will ensure the continued safety and well-being of such 
        individuals: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes Older Americans Month; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to provide 
        opportunities for older individuals to continue to flourish 
        by--
                    (A) emphasizing the importance and leadership of 
                older individuals through public recognition of their 
                ongoing achievements;
                    (B) presenting opportunities for older individuals 
                to share their wisdom, experience, and skills with 
                younger generations; and
                    (C) recognizing older individuals as valuable 
                assets in strengthening communities across the United 
                States.
                                 <all>
