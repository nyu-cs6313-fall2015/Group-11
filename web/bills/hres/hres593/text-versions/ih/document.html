[H. Res. 593 Introduced in House (IH)]

113th CONGRESS
  2d Session
H. RES. 593

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that in order to 
better understand water availability, sustainability, and security at a 
 national scale, the United States should prioritize the assessment of 
 the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater resources, 
and produce a national water census with the same sense of urgency that 
  was incorporated in the ``Man on the Moon'' project to address the 
                inevitable challenges of ``Peak Water''.

                              May 22, 2014

 Mr. Cartwright (for himself, Ms. Norton, and Mr. Grijalva) submitted 
   the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on 
  Natural Resources, and in addition to the Committees on Energy and 
  Commerce, Agriculture, and Transportation and Infrastructure, for a 
 period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for 
consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the 
                          committee concerned

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that in order to 
better understand water availability, sustainability, and security at a 
 national scale, the United States should prioritize the assessment of 
 the quality and quantity of surface water and groundwater resources, 
and produce a national water census with the same sense of urgency that 
  was incorporated in the ``Man on the Moon'' project to address the 
                inevitable challenges of ``Peak Water''.

Whereas water is an essential, irreplaceable component to all sectors of society 
        from agriculture, manufacturing, and energy development to domestic 
        consumption, recreation, human health, and ecological maintenance;
Whereas the consumption and allocation of water is therefore multi-objective, 
        and thus demands the management of different and often conflicting uses;
Whereas the practice of managing multiple water consumption interests is made 
        more challenging by the compounding effects of climate change, water 
        pollution, and population;
Whereas the procurement, production, and delivery of energy requires the 
        substantial mobilization and use of large quantities of water, and 
        further intensifies competing demands for limited water resources as 
        more people access and can afford more water-intensive lifestyles;
Whereas the increasing demand on water resources and our diminishing water 
        supply, coupled with competing interests in water consumption and 
        wastewater disposal, is surpassing our ability to provide safe, secure, 
        reliable water in many parts of the United States;
Whereas groundwater resources, vital to community water systems and irrigation 
        throughout the United States, are rapidly being depleted due to 
        increased demands coupled with changes in hydrologic and climate 
        patterns;
Whereas chronic water shortages are increasingly felt throughout the United 
        States with millions of people living in drought conditions and millions 
        more indirectly affected by drought, such as through increased food 
        prices;
Whereas the demand on water resources coupled with drought have substantially 
        lowered water levels in the United States navigable waterways and 
        negatively affected navigation, commerce, hydroelectric energy 
        production, recreation, and fishing;
Whereas cumulative impacts of human water diversions have led to reduced or 
        seasonally altered rivers in the United States, changing the magnitude 
        and frequency of floods, and adversely impacting ecosystems of vital 
        importance to human livelihoods;
Whereas water is a significant component to ecological flows and disruptions and 
        flow alterations can impose detrimental consequences to the chemical, 
        biological, and physical integrity of surface water and groundwater and 
        their ability to support ecological services including human 
        consumption, wildlife habitat, fisheries, and recreation; and
Whereas the National Water Availability and Use Assessment Program provisioned 
        in the SECURE Water Act is a foundational element necessary to 
        understand water use, availability, sustainability, and security in the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) to keep water costs affordable, curb environmental 
        impact, maintain ecological flows, safeguard economic 
        prosperity, and reduce risk, the United States should rapidly 
        transition to a sustainable, secure water economy that 
        prioritizes ecological flows;
            (2) to foster a national and regional understanding of 
        water use, availability, and sustainability, all Federal 
        agencies whose missions include water should coordinate their 
        efforts and collaborate with State and local water authorities; 
        and
            (3) to better understand water availability, 
        sustainability, and security on a national scale, the United 
        States should prioritize the assessment of the quality and 
        quantity of surface water and groundwater resources, and 
        produce a national water census with the same sense of urgency 
        that was incorporated in the ``Man on the Moon'' project to 
        address the inevitable challenges of ``Peak Water''.
