		<whereas>
      <text>Whereas a brutal conflict marked by more than three years of aggression and ethnic cleansing,
			 including the commission of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and
			 genocide as well as the use of sexual violence, especially rape, as a tool
			 of war, was brought to an end by the decisive actions eventually
			 undertaken by the international community with the strong leadership by
			 the United States, culminating in the General Framework Agreement for
			 Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina (commonly referred to as the <quote>Dayton Peace Accords</quote>), which was agreed to at Wright Patterson Air Force base in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21, 1995,
			 and signed in Paris on December 14, 1995;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas considerable progress on post-conflict recovery was achieved by Bosnia and Herzegovina in
			 partnership with an actively engaged international community during the
			 first decade of the implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords, generating
			 efforts to move beyond the Accord’s compromises that were originally
			 intended to restore peace more quickly and preserve and protect human
			 life, but have been considered in a more stable and secure environment to
			 be a hindrance to the development of more democratic, efficient and
			 effective political institutions, particularly at the state level, during
			 a time when the prospects for European and Euro-Atlantic integration make
			 the existence of such institutions necessary;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission has concluded that the current constitutional
			 arrangements of Bosnia and Herzegovina are neither efficient nor rational
			 and need to be reformed to make state-level institutions more effective
			 and democratic if the country is to move forward, and the European Court
			 for Human Rights has found certain provisions of the constitution of
			 Bosnia and Herzegovina to be in breach of the European Convention on Human
			 Rights because they establish ethnic criteria for certain elected
			 positions that are discriminatory;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the failure to reach consensus on constitutional reforms in the second decade of the
			 implementation of the Dayton Peace Accords has led to a deterioration of
			 the political atmosphere in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has been marred
			 by divisive rhetoric, unwillingness to work constructively with
			 representatives of the international community, threats to the
			 sovereignty, legal continuity, unity, and territorial integrity of the
			 country and pervasive official corruption;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas citizens in various municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina reacted to their severely
			 worsening socioeconomic conditions in 2014 with public protest and the
			 formulation of demands for the accountability of government officials, an
			 end to rampant corruption and numerous other actions to address their
			 grievances, particularly at the local level;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas elections at the state, entity, and cantonal level are scheduled to be held in Bosnia and
			 Herzegovina on October 12, 2014;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the European Union (EU) has expressed its full and firm support for Bosnia and
			 Herzegovina’s EU perspective, considers the country to be a potential
			 candidate country for membership, but views it at a standstill in the
			 European integration process while other countries in the region are
			 moving ahead;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the <cato:entity-ref entity-id="19RN" entity-type="federal-body">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</cato:entity-ref> (<cato:entity-ref entity-id="19RN" entity-type="federal-body">NATO</cato:entity-ref>) is committed to open membership to any
			 European country in a position to undertake the commitments and
			 obligations of membership and contribute to security in the Euro-Atlantic
			 area, including Bosnia and Herzegovina once it has achieved the necessary
			 progress in its reform efforts;</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas the international community retains the robust powers given to it by the Dayton Peace
			 Accords, but has declined in recent years to use those powers adequately
			 to address the deterioration of the political atmosphere in Bosnia and
			 Herzegovina and the resulting stagnation in the country’s progress toward
			 integration; and</text>
		</whereas>
    <whereas>
      <text>Whereas it is in the national interest of the United States to ensure that the sovereignty, legal
			 continuity, unity, and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina
			 within its internationally recognized borders, are respected and that
			 Bosnia and Herzegovina make progress in achieving its aspirations for
			 Euro-Atlantic and European integration through genuine reform efforts:
			 Now, therefore, be it</text>
