                               RESOLUTION


 
   Expressing support for the network of experienced and accredited 
 wildlife rehabilitation centers across the United States and honoring 
          their important work in protecting native wildlife.

Whereas across the United States, wildlife rehabilitators take in hundreds of 
        thousands of wild animals every year that have been orphaned, injured, 
        or become sick;
Whereas the purpose of wildlife rehabilitators is to restore health and 
        subsequently to release wild animals indigenous to the United States;
Whereas many of the wild animals cared for by rehabilitators are protected by 
        Federal and State laws;
Whereas rehabilitators are often volunteers and are not directly funded by 
        Federal or State natural resources or wildlife agencies;
Whereas most wildlife rehabilitators instead incur significant costs to fund 
        their activities, paying for everything from incubators to expensive 
        specialty food;
Whereas in addition to significant financial expenditures, wildlife 
        rehabilitators also spend substantial time and energy caring for and 
        bringing native wildlife back to health;
Whereas members of the general public cannot meet the specialized needs of wild 
        animals, and the United States needs a professional network of trained 
        individuals to provide this care; and
Whereas most wild animals are orphaned or injured and rehabilitators give them a 
        second chance: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the 
importance of experienced and accredited wildlife rehabilitation 
centers and their numerous contributions to the humane treatment of 
animals throughout the United States.
                                 <all>
