                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Dr. Shakil 
 Afridi is an American hero and that he should be immediately released 
                       from custody by Pakistan.

Whereas Dr. Shakil Afridi is a hero to whom the people of the United States owe 
        a debt of gratitude for his help in finding the hiding place of Osama 
        bin Laden;
Whereas Dr. Afridi, a Pakistani physician, demonstrated the universally 
        respected attributes of courage, dignity, and honor in aiding the United 
        States in bringing to an end the reign of the terrorist leader Osama bin 
        Laden who masterminded the September 11, 2001, attacks which murdered 
        3,000 United States citizens; and
Whereas Dr. Afridi is currently imprisoned by the Government of Pakistan, a 
        deplorable situation which constitutes a hostile act by Pakistan against 
        the United States and belies the notion that Pakistan is an ally in the 
        war against terrorism: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
Dr. Shakil Afridi is an American hero and that he should be immediately 
released from custody by Pakistan.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
