  Ms. Gabbard (for herself, Mr. Schock, Mr. Vargas, Mrs. Bustos, Mr.

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the benefits of charitable giving and expressing support 
      for the designation of December 2, 2014, as Giving Tuesday.

Whereas the Tuesday following Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday kicks 
        off the holiday giving season with a global day dedicated to charitable 
        giving known as Giving Tuesday;
Whereas Giving Tuesday is in its third year and has become a worldwide movement 
        that celebrates the power of giving in all its forms;
Whereas this movement was launched by a concerned and passionate group of people 
        who want to help celebrate the power of giving to enact positive change, 
        conceptualized by a group of innovators led by New York's 92nd Street Y, 
        first launched in partnership with the UN Foundation in 2012;
Whereas Giving Tuesday brought together more than 2,500 organizations from all 
        50 States in its first year;
Whereas Giving Tuesday continued to gain momentum in its second year, with 
        10,000 partners in the United States and 46 countries around the world, 
        increasing online donations 270 percent since the Tuesday after 
        Thanksgiving in 2011 (before Giving Tuesday began);
Whereas the United States is a country with a great and generous philanthropic 
        history and a new generation of young leaders are carrying the torch to 
        show that giving back is something that all parties can agree on, 
        transcending any differences of political ideologies and uniting people 
        across boundaries;
Whereas according to the 2014 Millennial Impact Report 87 percent of millennials 
        gave back to charity in 2013;
Whereas giving and philanthropy is something that transcends party lines;
Whereas Giving Tuesday is a special call to action to create a national day of 
        giving that moves beyond the annual shopping and spending moments to 
        inspire more, smarter, better and greater giving in the United States 
        and around the world every day; and
Whereas Giving Tuesday is an opportune time for people in the United States and 
        the world to come together and show how powerful humanity can be when we 
        unite to give to promote causes that promote peace, progress and 
        prosperity for a better world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the lasting impact of Giving Tuesday; and
            (2) supports the designation of Giving Tuesday.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
