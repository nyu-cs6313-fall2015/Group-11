Whereas Chuck Brown is known as the ``Godfather of Go-Go'' because he was the

        decade period;
Whereas Chuck Brown's song ``Bustin' Loose'', recorded with his group the Soul

        the residents of the District of Columbia;
Whereas the District of Columbia has named a street near the Howard Theatre for 
        Chuck Brown;
Whereas Chuck Brown is admired for having risen from humble beginnings and 
        overcoming time in prison to become a model leader, devoted father, and

        never stopped performing until his death: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
