                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that extensive 
  scientific and technical studies and analyses by the Department of 
   State and other Federal agencies have affirmed that the proposed 
       Keystone XL pipeline is an environmentally sound project.

Whereas safe and responsible production, transportation, and use of oil and 
        petroleum products provide the foundation of America's energy economy, 
        helping to secure and advance our economic prosperity, national 
        security, and overall quality of life;
Whereas Department of State assessments found that the Keystone XL pipeline ``is 
        not likely to impact the amount of crude oil produced from the oil 
        sands'' and that ``approval or denial of the proposed Project is 
        unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the 
        oil sands'';
Whereas the Department of State found that the incremental life-cycle greenhouse 
        gas emissions associated with the Keystone XL project are estimated in 
        the range of 0.07 to 0.83 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
        equivalents, with the upper end of this range representing twelve one-
        thousandths of one percent of the 6,702 million metric tons of carbon 
        dioxide emitted in the United States in 2011;
Whereas after extensive evaluation of potential impacts to land and water 
        resources along the Keystone XL pipeline's 875 mile proposed route, the 
        Department of State found that ``The analyses of potential impacts 
        associated with construction and normal operation of the proposed 
        Project suggest that there would be no significant impacts to most 
        resources along the proposed Project route (assuming Keystone complies 
        with all laws and required conditions and measures).'';
Whereas transportation of oil via pipeline has a record of unmatched safety and 
        environmental protection, and the Department of State found that 
        ``Spills associated with the proposed Project that enter the environment 
        are expected to be rare and relatively small'', and that ``there is no 
        evidence of increased corrosion or other pipeline threat due to 
        viscosity'' of diluted bitumen oil that will be transported by the 
        Keystone XL pipeline; and
Whereas plans to incorporate 57 project-specific special conditions related to 
        the design, construction, and operations of the Keystone XL pipeline led 
        the Department of State to find that the pipeline will have ``a degree 
        of safety over any other typically constructed domestic oil pipeline'': 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Federal Government's exhaustive scientific and technical analysis 
of the potential environmental impacts of the Keystone XL pipeline have 
repeatedly affirmed the environmental soundness and safety of the 
proposed project.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
