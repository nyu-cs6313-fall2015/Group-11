                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the President 
  should refrain from any further taxpayer-funded vacations until the 
             White House can be re-opened for public tours.

Whereas the Obama Administration announced on Tuesday March 5, 2013, that it 
        would cancel all White House tours due to sequestration;
Whereas the annual cost to the Secret Service of maintaining the White House 
        open for public tours is approximately $3.7 million;
Whereas the President has taken four trips to Hawaii in the past four years, at 
        a cost to the taxpayers of at least $4 million each, as well as numerous 
        other vacations at enormous taxpayer expense;
Whereas the President has plans for additional vacations in the coming months;
Whereas the President has the complete discretion to transfer funds in such a 
        way as to keep the White House open for tours; and
Whereas Congress, under similar budgetary pressures, has maintained the Capitol 
        open for public tours: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the President should refrain from any further vacations at the 
taxpayers' expense until such sums have been saved that the people's 
White House can be re-opened for public tours.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
