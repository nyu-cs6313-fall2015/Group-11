                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the month of June as Immigrant Heritage Month in honor of 
 the accomplishments and role of immigrants in shaping the history and 
                     culture of the United States.

Whereas the entrepreneurial drive and spirit of our country is built on our 
        diversity of origins;
Whereas it is what drew the first people to the U.S. and what continues to drive 
        American business;
Whereas American success is a result of our many distinct experiences, not in 
        spite of it;
Whereas America has always been a nation of immigrants, and throughout the 
        nation's history, immigrants from around the globe have kept our 
        workforce vibrant, our businesses on the cutting edge, and helped to 
        build the greatest economic engine in the world;
Whereas as a nation of immigrants, we must remember the generations of pioneers 
        that helped lay the railroads and build our cities, develop new 
        industries and fuel our Information Age, from the telegraph to the smart 
        phone;
Whereas immigrants represent 14 percent of all employed college graduates and 50 
        percent of Ph.D.s working in math and computer science occupations;
Whereas immigrant-owned small businesses generated a total of $776 billion in 
        receipts and employed an estimated 4.7 million people in 2007;
Whereas immigrants started 28 percent of all new U.S. businesses, despite 
        accounting for only 13 percent of the U.S. population in 2011;
Whereas immigrants or the children of immigrants founded more than 40 percent of 
        Fortune 500 companies;
Whereas these American companies represent 7 of the 10 most valuable brands 
        globally, collectively employ over 10 million people, and generate 
        annual revenue of $4.2 trillion;
Whereas immigrants' contributions in the high-tech sector are especially 
        striking, both in the number of businesses started and in the number of 
        patents filed;
Whereas between 2006 and 2012, 44 percent of new tech startups in Silicon 
        Valley, widely known as the international hub for technological 
        development and innovation, had at least one immigrant founder;
Whereas increased immigration to the United States has increased the earnings of 
        Americans with more than a high school degree; and
Whereas between 1990 and 2004, increased immigration was correlated with 
        increasing earnings of Americans by 0.7 percent and is expected to 
        contribute to an increase of 1.8 percent over the long term: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes ``Immigrant Heritage Month'' in honor of the 
        accomplishments and role of immigrants in shaping the history 
        and culture of the United States;
            (2) pledges to celebrate immigrant contributions to, and 
        immigrant heritage in, each district; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to 
        commemorate the history of immigrants in the United States and 
        to always remember our immigrant roots.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
