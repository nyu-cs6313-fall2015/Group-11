                               RESOLUTION


 
Condemning the Ukrainian separatists illegally occupying the Ukrainian 
   city of Donetsk, and the surrounding territory, as terrorists for 
shooting down a civilian passenger airliner, Malaysian Airlines Flight 
   MH17, and condemning the Government of the Russian Federation for 
                          supplying the arms.

Whereas the city of Donetsk, and the surrounding area, are recognized by the 
        United States as being under the jurisdiction of the Government of 
        Ukraine;
Whereas the city is occupied by a militant group wishing autonomy from the 
        Government of Ukraine;
Whereas this entity, calling itself the Donetsk People's Republic, is not 
        recognized as being autonomous by any sovereign nation;
Whereas the United States believes actions made by the separatists in Donetsk 
        are efforts by the Russian Federation to destabilize the Ukraine;
Whereas the United States-Ukraine ambassador Geoffrey R. Pyatt characterized the 
        separatists in Donetsk as terrorists;
Whereas Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down by a SA-11 Gadfly within 
        the surrounding area of Donetsk;
Whereas the act of targeting, engaging, and destroying a passenger airline of 
        non-combatants is considered an act of terror;
Whereas the SA-11 Gadfly is a Russian made Buk surface-to-air missile system; 
        and
Whereas producing weapons to a terrorist organization is considered by the 
        international community as ``state-sponsored terrorism'': Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the Ukrainian separatists illegally occupying 
        the Ukrainian city of Donetsk and the surrounding territory, as 
        terrorists for shooting down a civilian passenger airliner, 
        Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, and condemning the Government 
        of the Russian Federation for supplying the arms;
            (2) calls on the Ukrainian separatists of Donetsk to 
        disband and relinquish rightful control of the city of Donetsk 
        and the surrounding area to the Government of Ukraine;
            (3) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to 
        immediately desist attempts to undermine the Government of 
        Ukraine and to cease the arming of all militaristic and 
        terroristic groups;
            (4) calls on the President and Secretary of State, in 
        cooperation with responsible nations, to immediately condemn 
        the Ukrainian separatists of Donetsk for shooting down a 
        civilian passenger airliner and the Russian Federation for 
        supplying the arms; and
            (5) urges the President and Secretary of State to utilize 
        all available means to compel the Government of the Russian 
        Federation to withdraw all support from all militaristic and 
        terroristic groups whose goal is to undermine the Government of 
        Ukraine.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
