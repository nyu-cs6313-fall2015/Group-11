                               RESOLUTION


 
      Supporting the goals and ideals of American Education Week.

Whereas November 18 through November 22, 2013, marks the 92nd annual observance 
        of American Education Week;
Whereas public schools are the backbone of the Nation's democracy, providing 
        young people with the tools they need to maintain the Nation's precious 
        values of freedom, civility, and equality;
Whereas by equipping young people in the United States with both practical 
        skills and broader intellectual abilities, public schools give them hope 
        for, and access to, a productive future;
Whereas people working in the field of public education, be they teachers, 
        higher education faculty and staff, custodians, substitute educators, 
        bus drivers, clerical workers, food service professionals, workers in 
        skilled trades, health and student service workers, security guards, 
        technical employees, or librarians, work tirelessly to serve children 
        and communities throughout the Nation with care and professionalism; and
Whereas public schools are community linchpins, bringing together adults, 
        children, educators, volunteers, business leaders, and elected officials 
        in a common enterprise: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of American Education 
        Week; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        American Education Week by reflecting on the positive impact of 
        all those who work together to educate children.
                                 <all>
