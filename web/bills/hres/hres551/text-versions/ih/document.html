                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the mission and goals of 2014 National Crime Victims' Rights 
 Week, which include increasing public awareness of the rights, needs, 
and concerns of, and services available to assist, victims of crime in 
                           the United States.

Whereas in 2011, there were approximately 6,000,000 victims of violent crime and 
        more than 17,000,000 victims of property crime in the United States;
Whereas according to the National Crime Victimization Survey, nonfatal violent 
        crime in the United States increased by 17 percent and property crime in 
        the United States increased by 11 percent between 2010 and 2011;
Whereas according to the Uniform Crime Reporting Program of the Federal Bureau 
        of Investigation, ``law enforcement agencies throughout the nation 
        reported an increase of 1.9 percent in the number of violent crimes 
        brought to their attention for the first 6 months of 2012 when compared 
        with figures reported for the same time in 2011'';
Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on individuals, 
        families, schools, and communities by protecting the rights of crime 
        victims and ensuring that resources and services are available to help 
        rebuild the lives of such victims;
Whereas despite impressive accomplishments between 1974 and 2014 in increasing 
        the rights of, and services available to, crime victims, and the 
        families of such victims, many challenges remain to ensure that all 
        crime victims are--

    (1) treated with dignity, fairness, and respect;

    (2) offered support and services regardless of whether such victims 
report crimes committed against them; and

    (3) recognized as key participants within the criminal, juvenile, 
Federal, tribal, and civil justice systems in the United States when such 
victims report crimes;

Whereas crime victims in the United States need and deserve support and 
        assistance to help such victims cope with the often devastating 
        consequences of crime;
Whereas 2014 marks the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the Victims of Crime 
        Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``VOCA''), which is the hallmark of the commitment of the Federal 
        Government to supporting rights and services for victims of all types of 
        crime;
Whereas VOCA established the Crime Victims Fund, which is paid for by criminal 
        fines and penalties, rather than by taxpayer dollars;
Whereas the Crime Victims Fund has collected more than $20,400,000,000 from 
        criminals to be used exclusively to help victims of crime;
Whereas during each year between 1984 and 2014, communities across the United 
        States have joined Congress and the Department of Justice in 
        commemorating National Crime Victims' Rights Week to celebrate a shared 
        vision of a comprehensive and collaborative response that identifies and 
        addresses the many needs of crime victims;
Whereas Congress and the President agree on the need for a renewed commitment to 
        serving all victims of crime in the 21st century;
Whereas the theme of 2014 National Crime Victims' Rights Week, celebrated during 
        the week of April 6 through April 12, 2014, is ``30 Years: Restoring the 
        Balance of Justice'' and highlights the many challenges that confront 
        crime-victim assistance, justice, and public safety; and
Whereas the people of the United States recognize and appreciate the continued 
        importance of promoting the rights of, and services for, crime victims 
        and of honoring crime victims and individuals who provide services for 
        crime victims: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House--
            (1) supports the mission and goals of 2014 National Crime 
        Victims' Rights Week, which include increasing individual and 
        public awareness of--
                    (A) the impact of crime on victims;
                    (B) the challenges to achieving justice for 
                victims; and
                    (C) the many solutions to meet such challenges;
            (2) recognizes that crime victims should be treated with 
        dignity, fairness, and respect; and
            (3) recognizes the 30th anniversary of the enactment of the 
        Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10601 et seq.).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
