  <summary>5/19/2014--Introduced.
Calls on the government of Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).

Recognizes that the LLRC report has not adequately addressed accountability for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity that may have been committed by the government of Sri Lanka and the terrorist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

Commends the U.S. representatives on their leadership on United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution (UNHRC) A/HRC/25/L.1.Rev.1 establishing an Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights investigation into allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other human rights violations committed in Sri Lanka.

Recommends that the Department of State restrict U.S. entry for anyone responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Calls for the government of Sri Lanka to: (1) allow greater media and religious freedoms, and (2) prioritize the process of demilitarization.

Urges the government of Sri Lanka to allow humanitarian organizations and human rights groups greater access to war-affected individuals.

Calls on members of the Tamil National Alliance to acknowledge past relationships with the LTTE and make a commitment to reconciliation and a long-term political solution.

Acknowledges the importance for all parties to reach a lasting political settlement on the devolution of power consistent with LLRC recommendations and acceptable to all sides.</summary>
