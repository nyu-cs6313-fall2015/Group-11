                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             August 1, 2014

 Mrs. Davis of California (for herself, Mr. King of New York, and Mr. 
 Joyce) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the 
              Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
 States Postal Service should take all appropriate measures to ensure 
  the continuation of door delivery for all business and residential 
                               customers.

Whereas the United States Postal Service has announced that it may need to 
        eliminate or reduce levels of door-to-door delivery service by the 
        conversion of millions of homes and businesses to centralized delivery 
        or curbside and require those who wish to retain their door service to 
        pay a delivery tax;
Whereas reduced levels of service will have an immediate impact on current year 
        revenue and a long-term impact on the viability of a business inevitably 
        causing a larger drop in revenue from service cuts than from the 
        estimated savings of elimination or reducing door delivery;
Whereas door delivery is a vital service that the American people have relied on 
        since the 1860s in both rural and urban areas and ensures the security 
        of mail and packages;
Whereas voluntary conversion of businesses in 2013 equated to a mere 0.8 percent 
        of voluntary conversions confirming that businesses depend on in-person 
        contact with letter carriers to ensure transactional security and 
        initiate new business and revenue for the Postal Service;
Whereas millions of Americans will be forced to retrieve their daily mail and 
        packages from a centralized location removing the daily convenience for 
        Americans in receiving checks, medications and other essential items; 
        and
Whereas eliminating or reducing door delivery services will serve as a hindrance 
        for the elderly and disabled who will be forced to retrieve their mail 
        and packages and be required to submit to a cumbersome application 
        process in order to opt out of the requirement: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States Postal Service should take all appropriate measures 
to ensure the continuation of door delivery for all businesses and 
residential customers.
                                 <all>
