                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            December 8, 2014

 Mr. Israel submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
            the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that localities 
     should observe Halloween on the last Saturday of October and 
   communicate to the public that trick-or-treating and other public 
        observances of the holiday will take place on that day.

Whereas Halloween is not a federally established holiday and the observance of 
        the holiday is usually set on the local level;
Whereas when Halloween falls on a weekday children will likely trick-or-treat 
        after the sun has set;
Whereas according to a study from the U.S. Department of Transportation, between 
        2006 and 2010 more people under the age of 21 were killed in car 
        accidents on October 31 than on October 30 or November 1;
Whereas according to a 2011 survey commissioned by Safe Kids Worldwide, only 37 
        percent of parents send their children out trick-or-treating with a 
        flashlight, and only 18 percent affix reflective tape to their 
        children's costumes, both of which would make them more visible to 
        motorists;
Whereas observing Halloween on the weekend would allow children to trick-or-
        treat during the daytime; and
Whereas the last Saturday of October would be the optimal time to observe 
        Halloween: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
localities should--
            (1) observe Halloween on the weekend; and
            (2) communicate to the public that trick-or-treating and 
        other public observances of the holiday will take place on that 
        day.
