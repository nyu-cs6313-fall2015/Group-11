                               RESOLUTION


 
                Recognizing ``International Jazz Day''.

Whereas Jazz music originated in the United States in the early part of the 20th 
        century with roots in both African and European music traditions, and 
        has been characterized as the United States greatest musical 
        contribution to the world;
Whereas Jazz music has been enjoyed for more than a century by people from 
        varied cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and has been a consistent 
        unifying force among diverse populations;
Whereas Ahmet Ertegun, the founder of the Atlantic Records, and his brother 
        Nesuhi, the sons of Turkey's second Ambassador to the United States, in 
        the 1930s and 1940s organized the first-ever racially integrated jazz 
        concerts at the Turkish Embassy Residence at a time when Washington, DC, 
        was still segregated;
Whereas in November 2011, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
        Cultural Organization (UNESCO) officially designated April 30 of each 
        year as ``International Jazz Day'', recognizing the role played by Jazz 
        music in uniting people from all over the world;
Whereas legendary jazz pianist and composer Herbie Hancock has served as co-
        chair of ``International Jazz Day'' festivities in his capacity as 
        UNESCO Ambassador for Intercultural Dialogue and Chairman of the 
        Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz;
Whereas the Thelonius Monk Institute played a primary role in promoting the 
        first annual ``International Jazz Day'' in 2012, which was celebrated 
        throughout the world with concerts, education programs, seminars, 
        lectures, book readings, public jam sessions, and other events, in more 
        than 100 countries around the world;
Whereas among the worldwide 2012 ``International Jazz Day'' events were 3 high 
        profile celebrations, including a daylong festival in Paris, France, a 
        sunrise concert at Congo Square in New Orleans, Louisiana, and a sunset 
        concert at the United Nations General Assembly Hall in New York City, 
        New York; and
Whereas Istanbul, Turkey, will be the host city for ``International Jazz Day'' 
        in 2013, with a series of official celebrations, concerts, and 
        educational programs taking place throughout the city to compliment 
        worldwide events, culminating in an evening celebration concert at 
        Topkapi Palace: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates the Republic of Turkey and the city of 
        Istanbul for hosting the 2013 ``International Jazz Day'' and 
        commends the Thelonius Monk Institute for its role in 
        coordinating the worldwide celebration;
            (2) recognizes the historic connection between Turkey and 
        the jazz music through the contributions of the Ertegun 
        brothers; and
            (3) thanks Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, 
        Turkish Minister of Culture and Tourism Omer Celik, and Turkish 
        Ambassador Namik Tan for their assistance in assuring that the 
        ``International Jazz Day'' celebration in Istanbul, Turkey, 
        will be an important cultural and diplomatic success.
                                 <all>
