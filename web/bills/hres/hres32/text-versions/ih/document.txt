                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of the Friday after Thanksgiving 
       as the National Day of Recognition for Veterans' Families.

Whereas more than 2,250,000 people currently serve as members of the United 
        States Armed Forces;
Whereas veterans and current members of the Armed Forces have been separated 
        from loved ones because of military orders, deployment in support of 
        overseas operations, and other military missions carried out by the 
        Armed Forces;
Whereas these loved ones are recognized as ``Homefront Veterans'' who provide 
        vital support and help to make service in the Armed Forces possible;
Whereas Homefront Veterans keep households running, maintain the home, care for 
        children, pay the bills, and make ends meet while members serve in the 
        Armed Forces;
Whereas the families of veterans and members of the Armed Forces make important 
        and significant sacrifices for the United States and contribute to the 
        benefits of freedom all Americans enjoy;
Whereas the establishment of a national day of recognition is an appropriate way 
        to honor the sacrifices made by spouses, parents, children and all other 
        family of members of the Armed Forces; and
Whereas the day after Thanksgiving would be an appropriate date to establish as 
        the ``National Day of Recognition for Veterans' Families'': Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of the National Day of 
        Recognition for Veterans' Families;
            (2) honors and recognizes the contributions made by 
        families of members of the Armed Forces; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the National Day of Recognition for Veterans' Families to 
        promote awareness of the contributions of families of members 
        of the Armed Forces and veterans.
                                 <all>
