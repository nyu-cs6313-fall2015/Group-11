   Recognizing the roles and contributions of America's teachers to 
building and enhancing our Nation's civic, cultural, and economic well-
                                 being.

Whereas education and knowledge are the foundation of America's current and 
        future strength;
Whereas teachers and other education staff have earned and deserve the respect 
        of their students and communities for their selfless dedication to 
        community service and the future of our Nation's children;
Whereas the purpose of ``National Teacher Appreciation Week'', held during May 
        6, 2013, through May 10, 2013, is to raise public awareness of the 
        unquantifiable contributions of teachers and to promote greater respect 
        and understanding for the teaching profession; and
Whereas students, schools, communities, and a number of organizations 
        representing educators are hosting teacher appreciation events in 
        recognition of ``National Teacher Appreciation Week'': Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives thanks and promotes the 
profession of teaching by encouraging students, parents, school 
administrators, and public officials to participate in teacher 
appreciation events during ``National Teacher Appreciation Week''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
