                               RESOLUTION


 
           Supporting the contributions of Catholic schools.

Whereas Catholic schools in the United States are internationally acclaimed for 
        their academic excellence, and provide students with more than an 
        exceptional scholastic education;
Whereas Catholic schools instill a broad, values-added education emphasizing the 
        lifelong development of moral, intellectual, physical, and social values 
        in young people in the United States;
Whereas Catholic schools provide a high level of service to the Nation by 
        providing a diverse student population from all regions of the country 
        and all socio-economic backgrounds, with more than 30 percent of 
        students from minority backgrounds and nearly 15.4 percent non-Catholic, 
        a strong academic and moral foundation;
Whereas Catholic schools are an affordable option for parents, particularly in 
        underserved urban areas;
Whereas Catholic schools produce students strongly dedicated to their faith, 
        values, families, and communities by providing an intellectually 
        stimulating environment rich in spiritual, character, and moral 
        development;
Whereas Catholic schools are committed to community service, producing graduates 
        who hold ``helping others'' as one of their core values;
Whereas the total Catholic school student enrollment for the 2011-2012 academic 
        year was over 2,000,000 and the student-teacher ratio was 13.1 to 1;
Whereas the Catholic high school graduation rate is 99 percent, with nearly 85 
        percent of graduates attending 4-year colleges;
Whereas in the 1972 pastoral message concerning Catholic education, the National 
        Conference of Catholic Bishops stated, ``Education is one of the most 
        important ways by which the Church fulfills its commitment to the 
        dignity of the person and building of community. Community is central to 
        education ministry, both as a necessary condition and an ardently 
        desired goal. The educational efforts of the Church, therefore, must be 
        directed to forming persons-in-community; for the education of the 
        individual Christian is important not only to his solitary destiny, but 
        also the destinies of the many communities in which he lives.'';
Whereas the week of January 27, 2013, to February 2, 2013, has been designated 
        as National Catholic Schools Week by the National Catholic Educational 
        Association and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; and
Whereas the theme for National Catholic Schools Week 2012 is ``Catholic Schools 
        Raise the Standards'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals of National Catholic Schools Week, 
        an event cosponsored by the National Catholic Educational 
        Association and the United States Conference of Catholic 
        Bishops and established to recognize the vital contributions of 
        the thousands of Catholic elementary and secondary schools in 
        the United States;
            (2) applauds the National Catholic Educational Association 
        and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on their 
        selection of a theme that all can celebrate; and
            (3) supports the continued dedication of catholic schools, 
        students, parents, and teachers across the United States toward 
        academic excellence, and supports the key role they play in 
        promoting and ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the 
        Nation.
