		<whereas><text>Whereas when abuse-deterrent formulations of a drug have
			 been developed, approved, and recognized as effective by the Food and Drug
			 Administration, the approval and marketing of generic versions that do not have
			 abuse-deterrent features are likely to prevent achievement of the public health
			 purposes of the efforts to develop such abuse-deterrent formulations;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the
			 Food and Drug Administration have for many years strongly encouraged
			 manufacturers of opioid drug products to develop abuse-deterrent formulations
			 designed to prevent or discourage the abuse or misuse of those products;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in response, several opioid drug manufacturers
			 have developed abuse-deterrent formulations;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas helping to reduce the level of abuse of opioid
			 drug products is dependent on the widespread adoption of new technologies and
			 approaches to the safer formulation of these drugs;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has
			 acknowledged that the Food and Drug Administration has the authority under
			 current law to require generic versions of products that have been formulated
			 or reformulated with abuse-deterrent features to have comparable features;
			 and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas fourteen Members of Congress in a bipartisan
			 coalition have cosponsored the Stop Tampering with Prescription Pills (STOPP)
			 Act, which would similarly promote abuse-deterrent technologies in addictive
			 painkillers: Now, therefore, be it</text>
