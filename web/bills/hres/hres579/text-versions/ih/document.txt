                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 50th anniversary of the Congressional declaration of 
     bourbon whiskey as a distinctive product of the United States.

Whereas on May 4, 1964, Congress declared bourbon whiskey a distinctive product 
        of the United States that is unlike other types of alcoholic beverages, 
        whether foreign or domestic;
Whereas to be designated as ``bourbon'', a product must conform to high 
        standards and be manufactured in accordance with the laws and 
        regulations of the United States, which prescribe Federal Standards of 
        Identity for ``bourbon whisky'';
Whereas bourbon whiskey has achieved recognition and acceptance throughout the 
        world as a distinctive product of the United States;
Whereas Kentucky, the birthplace of bourbon, produces 95 percent of the world's 
        supply;
Whereas Kentucky's iconic bourbon brands are reaching farther than ever, with 
        more than 30,000,000 gallons shipped to 126 countries, making bourbon 
        the largest export category among all United States distilled spirits 
        and a source of national pride;
Whereas bourbon production has increased by more than 120 percent since 1999; 
        and
Whereas bourbon is a vital part of American culture and the economy, generating 
        9,000 jobs in Kentucky and almost $2,000,000,000 in gross Kentucky 
        product in 2010: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the 50th 
anniversary of the Congressional declaration of bourbon whiskey as a 
distinctive product of the United States.
                                 <all>
