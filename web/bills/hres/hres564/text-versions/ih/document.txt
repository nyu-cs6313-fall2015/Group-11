                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for designation of May 2014 as ``Health and Fitness 
                                Month''.

Whereas \2/3\ of adults and nearly 1 in 3 children are overweight or obese in 
        the United States;
Whereas unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity have contributed 
        to the obesity epidemic in the United States;
Whereas the prevalence of obesity in the United States more than doubled from 15 
        percent to 34 percent among adults and more than tripled from 5 percent 
        to 17 percent among children and adolescents from 1980 to 2008;
Whereas an obese teenager is 70 percent more likely to become an obese adult;
Whereas obesity is more common among non-Hispanic Black teenagers (29 percent) 
        than Hispanic teenagers (17.5 percent) or non-Hispanic White teenagers 
        (14.5 percent);
Whereas 70 percent of American Indian/Alaskan Native adults are overweight or 
        obese;
Whereas studies indicate that overweight youth may never achieve a healthy 
        weight;
Whereas a poor diet is associated with major health risks that can cause illness 
        and even death;
Whereas in addition to healthy eating, people in the United States can 
        experience positive health benefits and be on the path for a better 
        future by incorporating physical activity into daily life, including 30 
        minutes for adults and 60 minutes for children;
Whereas physical activity can help prevent chronic diseases such as heart 
        disease, cancer, and stroke, control weight, reduce fat, condition the 
        heart and lungs, improve sleep, decrease potential of becoming 
        depressed, increase energy and self-esteem, relieve stress, and increase 
        the chances of living longer; and
Whereas May 2014 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``Health and 
        Fitness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Health and Fitness 
        Month''; and
            (2) supports efforts to educate the people of the United 
        States on the importance of a healthy and nutritious lifestyle.
                                 <all>
