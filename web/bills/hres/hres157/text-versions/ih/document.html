                               RESOLUTION


 
         Honoring the Sikh community's celebration of Vaisakhi.

Whereas Sikhism is a religion founded in the Punjab region of South Asia over 
        five centuries ago and introduced to the United States in the 19th 
        century;
Whereas Sikhism is the fifth largest world religion with approximately 25 
        million adherents from diverse backgrounds throughout the world, 
        including 500,000 adherents in the United States;
Whereas Sikhs in the United States pursue diverse professions and walks of life, 
        making rich contributions to the social, cultural, and economic vibrancy 
        of the United States, including service as members of the United States 
        Armed Forces;
Whereas Vaisakhi is one of the most religiously significant days in Sikh 
        history, commemorating the creation of the Khalsa, a fellowship of 
        devout Sikhs, by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699;
Whereas the Sikh religion is based on a belief in one God and the equality of 
        all human beings; and
Whereas the celebration of Vaisakhi includes performing Seva (selfless service), 
        such as providing free meals to all visitors to Sikh Gurdwaras (Houses 
        of Worship): Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives wishes the Sikh 
American community a joyous Vaisakhi.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
