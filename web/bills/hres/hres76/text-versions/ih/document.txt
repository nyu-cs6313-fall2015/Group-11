                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
 States and the European Union should pursue a Transatlantic Trade and 
                        Investment Partnership.

Whereas the United States-European Union High Level Working Group on Jobs and 
        Growth (HLWG) issued its final report on February 11, 2013;
Whereas the economies of the European Union and the United States account for 
        nearly one-half of world GDP;
Whereas the European Union and United States account for 30 percent of world 
        trade;
Whereas $2.7 billion of goods and services are traded bilaterally each day, 
        supporting millions of jobs in both economies;
Whereas direct investments by the United States and European Union on both sides 
        of the Atlantic total more than $3.7 trillion;
Whereas the HLWG recommended a comprehensive agreement that ``addresses a broad 
        range of bilateral trade and investment issues, including regulatory 
        issues, and contributes to the development of global rules'';
Whereas the HLWG found that a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment 
        Partnership that ``addresses a broad range of bilateral trade and 
        investment issues, including regulatory issues, and contributes to the 
        development of global rules, would provide the most significant mutual 
        benefit of the various options [it] considered.'';
Whereas the HLWG recommended that a ``comprehensive agreement would include 
        ambitious reciprocal market opening in goods, services, and investment, 
        and would address the challenges and opportunities of modernizing trade 
        rules and enhancing the compatibility of regulatory regimes'';
Whereas the HLWG outlines a structure and content that includes market access, 
        regulatory issues and nontariff barriers, and rules addressing shared 
        global trade challenges and opportunities;
Whereas the HLWG recommended that ``in addition to pursuing the elements of a 
        comprehensive agreement, the two sides seek to make early and continuing 
        progress on SPS measures affecting bilateral trade.''; and
Whereas the HLWG recommended ``to Leaders that each side initiate as soon as 
        possible the formal domestic procedures necessary to launch negotiations 
        on a comprehensive trade and investment agreement.'': Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) a comprehensive and ambitious Transatlantic Trade and 
        Investment Partnership would support the creation of 
        significant good-paying jobs for American workers, ranchers, 
        and farmers;
            (2) a comprehensive and ambitious Transatlantic Trade and 
        Investment Partnership would open new opportunity for United 
        States companies to sell their goods and services in the 
        European Union;
            (3) a comprehensive and ambitious Transatlantic Trade and 
        Investment Partnership would further bond the economies of 
        Europe and the United States and give rise to a dominant 
        economic alliance that would strongly influence other nations 
        toward market-based economies;
            (4) the President should promptly submit written notice to 
        Congress of the President's intention to enter into 
        negotiations with the European Union for a comprehensive 
        Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership; and
            (5) as soon as possible after providing notice and 
        completing appropriate consultations with Congress, the 
        President should initiate negotiations for a comprehensive 
        Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
                                 <all>
