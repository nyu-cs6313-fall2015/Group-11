                               RESOLUTION


 
Encouraging people in the United States to recognize March 1, 2013, as 
                        Read Across America Day.

Whereas reading is a basic requirement for quality education and professional 
        success, and is a source of pleasure throughout life;
Whereas the people of the United States must be able to read if the United 
        States is to remain competitive in the global economy;
Whereas Congress has placed great emphasis on reading intervention and providing 
        additional resources for reading assistance, including through the 
        programs authorized in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
        1965 and programs such as Early Reading First, Improving Literacy 
        through School Libraries, and Striving Readers; and
Whereas more than 50 national organizations concerned about reading and 
        education have joined with the National Education Association (NEA) to 
        use March 1 to celebrate reading and the birth of Theodor Geisel, also 
        known as Dr. Seuss: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors Theodor Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss, for his 
        success in encouraging children to discover the joy of reading;
            (2) honors the 15th anniversary of Read Across America Day;
            (3) encourages parents to read with their children for at 
        least 30 minutes on Read Across America Day in honor of the 
        commitment of the House of Representatives to building a Nation 
        of readers; and
            (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        Read Across America Day with appropriate ceremonies and 
        activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
