                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating the Chicago Blackhawks on winning the 2013 Stanley Cup 
                             Championship.

Whereas the historic Chicago Blackhawks, as one of the ``Original Six'', have 
        made countless contributions to sports;
Whereas the Blackhawks and the National Hockey League have demonstrated a 
        commitment to promoting fitness and leadership skills for youth through 
        support for youth hockey programs and community skating facilities;
Whereas the Blackhawks have demonstrated a commitment to the Nation's veterans 
        and wounded warriors through their support of sled-hockey rehabilitation 
        programs and unique on-ice opportunities;
Whereas with 227 straight home game sellouts and an NHL leading regular-season 
        average attendance of 21,775, the Blackhawks are the pride of their 
        hometown, Chicago, Illinois;
Whereas the Blackhawks organization of Rocky Wirtz, Joel Quenneville, John 
        McDonough, Jay Blunk, Stan Bowman, and Scotty Bowman have enshrined 
        Chicago as a hockey town for the 21st century;
Whereas the Blackhawks, through amazing offense, superb defense, and unmatched 
        goaltending, dominated the regular season and overcame the lockout to 
        set an NHL record for a point earned in each of the first 24 games of 
        the season;
Whereas the Blackhawks tamed the Minnesota Wild in 5 games, brought down their 
        arch rivals the Detroit Red Wings in a tough 7-game series, and 
        dethroned the Los Angeles Kings to become the Western Conference 
        Champions and advance to the Stanley Cup Final;
Whereas in the Stanley Cup Final series, the Blackhawks overcame the aggressive 
        play and talent of the Eastern Conference Champion Boston Bruins, to win 
        the championship in one of the most exciting and nail-biting final games 
        in recent history; and
Whereas the innumerable contributions from every player, coach, and the entire 
        Blackhawks family have brought the madness back to Madison Street and 
        Lord Stanley's Cup back to where it belongs, sweet home Chicago, 
        Illinois: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the Chicago Blackhawks for their long 
        distinguished history, countless contributions to sports, and 
        their many successes as a franchise;
            (2) congratulates the Blackhawks on an amazing season and 
        for winning the 2013 Stanley Cup Championship;
            (3) recognizes the players, coaches, and leadership of the 
        Blackhawks organization; and
            (4) joins with all people in the United States and hockey 
        fans all over the world in celebrating the return of the 
        Stanley Cup to Chicago, Illinois.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
