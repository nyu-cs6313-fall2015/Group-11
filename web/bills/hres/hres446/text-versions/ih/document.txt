                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that both Houses 
 of Congress should reconvene on or before December 18, 2013, to take 
    appropriate action to enact legislation extending the Emergency 
        Unemployment Compensation Program until January 1, 2015.

Whereas the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program (hereinafter referred to 
        as the ``EUC Program'') was created on June 30, 2008, when President 
        George W. Bush signed the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public 
        Law 110-252) into law;
Whereas the EUC Program is the 8th time Congress has created a Federal temporary 
        program that has extended unemployment compensation during an economic 
        slowdown;
Whereas the authorization for the EUC Program expires December 28, 2013;
Whereas unless the EUC Program is extended, more than 1,300,000 jobless workers 
        will have their benefits cut off on December 28, 2013, and nearly 
        another 1,900,000 jobless workers will lose their unemployment benefits 
        between January 1 and June 30, 2014;
Whereas it is estimated that failure to extend the EUC Program will result in a 
        loss of 310,000 jobs next year because of reduced consumer demand;
Whereas it is estimated that failure to extend the EUC Program will reduce 
        economic growth by as much as 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2014;
Whereas the Congressional Budget Office reported in 2012 that assistance for the 
        unemployed has one of the ``largest effects on employment per dollar of 
        budgetary cost'' because financially stressed unemployed workers spend 
        any benefits they receive quickly;
Whereas failure to extend the EUC Program will further hurt an economy already 
        injured by the loss of an estimated 750,000 jobs resulting from budget 
        cuts mandated by sequestration and the loss of more than 120,000 jobs in 
        the first 2 weeks of October 2013 as a consequence of the shutdown of 
        the Federal Government;
Whereas 36 percent of unemployed workers have been out of work for more than 6 
        months, in part because the national economy still has 2,000,000 fewer 
        jobs than before the Great Recession began in 2008; and
Whereas if Congress does not act immediately to extend these benefits, a 
        devastating blow will be dealt not only to the millions of Americans who 
        are already struggling, but to our economy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
both Houses of Congress should reconvene on or before December 18, 
2013, to take appropriate action to enact legislation extending the 
Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program until January 1, 2015.
