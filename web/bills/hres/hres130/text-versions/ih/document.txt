                               RESOLUTION


 
  Recognizing the cultural and historical significance of Nowruz and 
   acknowledging the Cyrus Cylinder as a symbol of respect for human 
                    rights and religious tolerance.

Whereas Nowruz marks the traditional Iranian New Year, which originated in 
        ancient Persia, and dates back more than 3,000 years;
Whereas Nowruz occurs on the vernal equinox and celebrates the arrival of 
        spring;
Whereas Nowruz serves to remind the United States of the many lasting 
        contributions of the Persian civilization to the world and the 
        noteworthy impact of Iranian-Americans to the social and economic fabric 
        of society in the United States;
Whereas in 539 B.C.E., the Cyrus Cylinder, an ancient clay cylinder inscribed 
        with a declaration in Babylonian cuneiform in the name of Cyrus, which 
        was created following the Persian conquest of Babylon has, over the 
        centuries, come to symbolize mankind's first document on human rights;
Whereas Cyrus II (also known as Cyrus the Great) of Persia is recognized for his 
        achievements in human rights, politics, and religious tolerance, as well 
        as his influence on future Eastern and Western civilizations;
Whereas the policies of Cyrus toward minority religions are further documented 
        in Babylonian texts and Jewish sources, and historical accounts;
Whereas the Cyrus Cylinder has had significant impact on the respect for human 
        rights that Iranian Americans believe in today;
Whereas an exhibition will tour in the United States to celebrate the Cyrus 
        Cylinder as a symbol of tolerance and respect for different peoples and 
        different faiths;
Whereas the Cyrus Cylinder exhibition will take place in Washington, DC, 
        Houston, Texas, New York, New York, San Francisco, California, and Los 
        Angeles, California;
Whereas the launch of the Cyrus Cylinder exhibition coincides with the Nowruz 
        holiday and connects the Persian New Year to the values of human rights; 
        and
Whereas the Cyrus Cylinder symbolizes the universal hopes and aspirations of all 
        people for human rights and religious tolerance: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the cultural and historical significance of 
        Nowruz;
            (2) recognizes the hopes and aspirations of all people, 
        including the people of Iran for human rights and religious 
        tolerance as embodied by the Cyrus Cylinder; and
            (3) recognizes the tour of the Cyrus Cylinder throughout 
        the United States.
                                 <all>
