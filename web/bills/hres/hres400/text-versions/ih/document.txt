Whereas Commander M. Scott Carpenter was 1 of the original 7 astronauts of the 
        National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Project Mercury;
Whereas, in 1962, Mr. Carpenter, aboard the spacecraft Aurora 7, was the second 
        American to orbit the Earth and was able to overcome extreme technical 
        difficulties during the mission by manually piloting the spacecraft to a 
        safe re-entry;
Whereas, in 1965, Mr. Carpenter spent 30 days living and working on the ocean 
        floor as an aquanaut aboard the Sealab II;

        and was also a resident of New York City for a time;
Whereas Mr. Carpenter became a naval aviation cadet in 1943, serving his country 
        for the duration of World War II, after which he entered the University 
        of Colorado in 1946, received a Navy commission in 1949, and earned his 
        wings of gold in 1951;
Whereas Mr. Carpenter flew patrol planes during the Korean war, trained as a 
        test pilot at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, and was chosen 
        in April 1959 among 7 military test pilots to be a Mercury astronaut, 
        helping to carry out President John F. Kennedy's goal of putting a man 
        on the Moon; and

        sons Jay, Matthew, Nicholas, and Zachary; his daughters Kristen Stoever

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors Commander M. Scott Carpenter for his brave work,
