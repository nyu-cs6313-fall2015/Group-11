  <summary>1/13/2014--Introduced.
Recognizes that the Lunar New Year is a significant cultural holiday for many Asian-Americans in the United States.

Encourages local education agencies serving a substantial Asian-American population to close schools on that day each year in recognition of its cultural significance and to reduce the waste in government resources necessitated by holding school open on a day when a substantial portion of the student or teacher population is absent.</summary>
