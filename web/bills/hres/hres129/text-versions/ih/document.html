                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Congress 
 should not pass any legislation that would tax or confiscate personal 
  savings accounts, including retirement accounts such as Individual 
  Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401k plans, certificates of deposit 
   (CDs), or other personal savings to provide financial relief for 
                          private businesses.

Whereas the personal savings and retirement accounts of the American public are 
        the personal property of their owners;
Whereas personal savings and retirement accounts are used by millions of 
        Americans to fund their retirement, their children's education, their 
        purchase of a family home, and other uses according to their pursuit of 
        happiness;
Whereas the United States Government should not abuse its power by substituting 
        political priorities for the personal economic choices of millions of 
        individual Americans;
Whereas previous attempts to use taxpayer money to provide financial relief to 
        troubled industries has failed to produce economic recovery and has 
        undermined the American system of economic freedom; and
Whereas the American system of economic freedom has given millions of ordinary 
        people the opportunity to pursue economic success and their American 
        dream: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Congress should--
            (1) refrain from considering or adopting any legislation 
        that would tax or confiscate any or all personal savings held 
        by the American people, including retirement accounts such as 
        Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and 401k plans, 
        certificates of deposit (CDs), or other personal savings and 
        assets; and
            (2) refrain from considering or adopting any legislation to 
        provide financial relief to a private business or general 
        sector of the American economy at taxpayer expense.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
