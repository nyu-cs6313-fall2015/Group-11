                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            December 2, 2013

     Mr. Jones (for himself and Mr. Lynch) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the Select Committee on Intelligence 
                           (Permanent Select)

                               RESOLUTION


 
Urging the president to release information regarding the September 11, 
            2001, terrorist attacks upon the United States.

Whereas President George W. Bush classified 28 pages of the Joint Inquiry into 
        Intelligence Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of 
        September 2001;
Whereas the contents of the redacted pages are necessary for a full public 
        understanding of the events and circumstances surrounding the September 
        11, 2001, attacks upon the United States;
Whereas the Executive Branch's decision to maintain the classified status of 
        these pages prevents the people of the United States from having access 
        to information about the involvement of certain foreign governments in 
        the terrorist attacks of September 2001; and
Whereas the people of the United States and the families of the victims of the 
        September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks deserve full and public disclosure 
        of the results of the Joint Inquiry: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the President should declassify the 28-page section of 
        the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before 
        and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 2001; and
            (2) the families of the victims and the people of the 
        United States deserve answers about the events and 
        circumstances surrounding the September 11, 2001, attacks upon 
        the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
