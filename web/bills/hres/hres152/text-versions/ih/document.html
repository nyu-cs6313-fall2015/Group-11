                               RESOLUTION


 
  Celebrating the anniversary of the enactment of Public Law 87-788, 
    commonly known as the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act.

Whereas October 10, 2013, marks the 51th anniversary of the enactment of Public 
        Law 87-788 (commonly known as the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative Forestry 
        Act; 16 U.S.C. 582a et seq.), which authorizes the Secretary of 
        Agriculture to encourage and assist States in conducting a program of 
        forestry research;
Whereas the Act was named for the two primary, bipartisan sponsors of the Act, 
        Representative Clifford G. McIntire of Maine and Senator John C. Stennis 
        of Mississippi, who recognized that research in forestry is the 
        ``driving force behind progress in developing and utilizing the Nation's 
        forests'';
Whereas the Act recognized that forestry research would be more effective 
        nationwide if efforts among State colleges and universities were 
        partnered with and more closely coordinated with forestry research 
        activities carried out by the Federal Government;
Whereas Congressman McIntire and Senator Stennis stated a clear intent to 
        address the important need for increased numbers of highly trained 
        forestry scientists and other research professionals in the United 
        States;
Whereas the Act has provided base funding throughout five decades to create and 
        strengthen research and training capacity in forestry at State-supported 
        colleges and universities;
Whereas funds provided through the Act at State-supported colleges and 
        universities are highly leveraged with non-Federal funds;
Whereas university-based forestry research has provided an accumulated wealth of 
        science-based knowledge, skills, and technologies that have been 
        critical for sustaining the economic, ecological, and social benefits of 
        forests in the United States;
Whereas funding provided through the Act for forestry research at State-
        supported colleges and universities has provided significant graduate 
        student support for the more than 50 years, resulting in the award of 
        8,500 master's degrees and 2,600 doctoral degrees; and
Whereas the State-supported colleges and universities receiving funds through 
        the Act conduct forestry research in each State and in four territories 
        of the United States, and disseminate the results of such research 
        locally, regionally, nationally, and globally for the betterment of 
        local communities, the Nation, and the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) celebrates the anniversary of the enactment of Public 
        Law 87-788, commonly known as the McIntire-Stennis Cooperative 
        Forestry Act (16 U.S.C. 582a et seq.);
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        and celebrate the anniversary of the enactment of the McIntire-
        Stennis Cooperative Forestry Act; and
            (3) affirms the continuing importance and vitality of the 
        State-supported colleges and universities conducting forestry 
        research and training supported by the McIntire-Stennis 
        Cooperative Forestry Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
