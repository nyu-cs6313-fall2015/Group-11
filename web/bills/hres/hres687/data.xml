  <summary>7/25/2014--Introduced.
Agrees with the President that there is a humanitarian crisis on the border that underscores the need to fix our immigration system.

Calls upon the President to:

 use the resources already at his disposal to gain operational control of the border; send a clear message that those who are seeking to enter the United States illegally will be returned to their home countries, and that subjecting children to the perilous migration to our border will no longer be tolerated; cease using his prosecutorial discretion authority to shield unlawful immigrants from prosecution; cease releasing convicted criminal aliens from detention; crack down on fraudulent asylum claims; implement tougher standards for credible fear claims; restore agreements with local law enforcement agencies to enforce immigration laws; give Border Patrol agents access to federal lands where drug traffickers, human smugglers, and unlawful immigrants hide; and employ diplomatic resources with Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to stop the border crisis. Stands ready to work with the President to realize such calls to action.</summary>
