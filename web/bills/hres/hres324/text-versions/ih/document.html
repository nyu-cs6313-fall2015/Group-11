                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of the week of September 22, 2013, 
 through September 28, 2013, as ``National Marine Technology Week'' to 
 recognize the important contributions that marine technology has made 
                         to the United States.

Whereas 50 years of marine technology have benefitted the economy and the 
        environment of the United States;
Whereas ocean exploration by scientists and engineers has taken them to the 
        greatest depths of the sea and to archeological sites;
Whereas underwater technologies, such as remotely operated vehicles, autonomous 
        underwater vehicles, and manned submersibles, have led to the discovery 
        of many historic shipwrecks, including that of the RMS Titanic, the 
        Bismarck, USS Yorktown, and the SS Cental America;
Whereas the advancement of marine technologies is credited with reducing the 
        negative economic and infrastructural effects and loss of life caused by 
        storms;
Whereas the advancement of marine technologies has provided significant 
        improvements in the mitigation of environmental and natural disasters;
Whereas the advancement of marine technologies in fisheries has improved the 
        economy, the environment, and the way of life for many individuals in 
        several regions of the United States;
Whereas the advancement of marine technologies is credited with detecting ocean 
        pollution, including debris items and other obstructions on the 
        seafloor, that may be hazardous for shipping and seafloor installations;
Whereas the marine technology industry improves the technologies used in the 
        development of energy and renewable energy from ocean waves, tides, off-
        shore wind, minerals, salinity, petroleum, and natural gas;
Whereas the technological achievements of the marine scientists and engineers 
        working for Federal agencies, private maritime industries, and nonprofit 
        organizations have set enviable standards for the world in commercial 
        endeavors, policy, and innovation;
Whereas there exist in the United States numerous internationally recognized 
        centers of excellence in the academic pursuit of marine science and 
        engineering;
Whereas the use of marine technology for education in the classroom contributes 
        to teaching middle school students, high school students, and students 
        at institutions of higher education the value of ocean-related careers 
        and has improved science, technology, engineering, and math skills of 
        such students; and
Whereas September 22, 2013, through September 28, 2013, would be an appropriate 
        week to designate as ``National Marine Technology Week'': Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Marine 
        Technology Week'';
            (2) recognizes the important contributions that marine 
        technology has made to the United States; and
            (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe 
        ``National Marine Technology Week'' with appropriate ceremonies 
        and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
