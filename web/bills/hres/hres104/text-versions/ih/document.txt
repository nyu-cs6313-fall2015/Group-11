                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
importance of easing the transition of members of the Armed Forces and 
             their families from military to civilian life.

Whereas members of the Armed Forces and their families make great sacrifices on 
        behalf of the United States, and, when their active duty service is 
        successfully concluded, members deserve the opportunity to also make a 
        successful transition to the civilian labor force;
Whereas, when transitioning from active duty in the Armed Forces to civilian 
        employment, members often face barriers that make it difficult to fully 
        utilize the skills and training they gained during their military 
        service;
Whereas members and veterans are too often required to repeat education or 
        training in order to receive industry certifications and State 
        occupational licenses, even though their military training and 
        experience often overlaps with the certification or licensing 
        requirements;
Whereas, when members are transferred from military assignment to military 
        assignment, their spouses often face barriers to transferring their 
        credentials and to securing employment in their new location;
Whereas more than one million members will make the transition to civilian life 
        in the coming years;
Whereas the Department of Defense established the Military Credentialing and 
        Licensing Task Force in 2012; and
Whereas the Joining Forces program, a national initiative to mobilize all 
        sectors of society to give members of the Armed Forces and their 
        families the opportunities and support they have earned, will make it 
        easier for members and their families to transfer skills learned while 
        the member was serving in the Armed Forces to civilian employment: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the Federal Government and State governments should 
        make the transition of a member of the Armed Forces and the 
        member's spouse from military to civilian life as seamless as 
        possible by creating opportunities for the member and spouse to 
        earn, while the member is in the Armed Forces, civilian 
        occupational credentials and licenses, with an emphasis on 
        well-paying industries and occupations that have a high demand 
        for skilled workers, including: manufacturing, information 
        technology, transportation and logistics, health care, and 
        emergency medical services;
            (2) the Federal Government should assist State governments 
        in translating military training and experience into credit 
        towards professional licensure; and
            (3) State governments should streamline approaches for 
        assessing the equivalency of military training and experience, 
        and accelerate occupational licensing processes for members, 
        veterans, and their spouses.
                                 <all>
