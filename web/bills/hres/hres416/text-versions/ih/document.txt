        in New York City on June 28, 1969 are among the pioneers within this

        invidious discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender

Whereas in May of 1996, in Romer v. Evans, the United States Supreme Court

        unconstitutional;

        discriminate against married lesbian and gay couples for the purposes of 
        determining Federal benefits and protections; and

        has faced, and continues to face, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
        transgender people; and
            (4) agrees that the United States must continue to strive 
        to ensure that the promise of equality is realized for all 
        Americans.
