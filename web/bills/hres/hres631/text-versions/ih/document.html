                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             June 19, 2014

Mr. DesJarlais (for himself and Ms. Duckworth) submitted the following 
   resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Oversight and 
                           Government Reform

                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the goals and ideals of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 
                            Awareness Month.

Whereas more than 5,200,000 people are estimated to live with posttraumatic 
        stress disorder during the course of a given year in the United States;
Whereas women are more likely than men to develop posttraumatic stress disorder 
        during their lifetime;
Whereas according to the Veterans Affairs National Center for Post-Traumatic 
        Stress Disorder, experts believe roughly 11 to 20 percent of veterans 
        who served in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 
        Freedom suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder;
Whereas less than 40 percent of returning military personnel seek assistance;
Whereas as many as 10 percent of veterans who served in the Persian Gulf War and 
        30 percent of veterans who served during the Vietnam era suffer from the 
        effects of post-traumatic stress disorder;
Whereas without treatment, posttraumatic stress disorder can lead to alcohol and 
        drug abuse, flashbacks, heart attacks, depression, suicide, and stroke;
Whereas posttraumatic stress disorder can cause pernicious effects in families 
        and communities;
Whereas raising public awareness of this condition will help facilitate the 
        discovery of effective treatment options, therapies and a cure; and
Whereas the dedication of organizations, researchers, doctors, medical 
        facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and people working 
        across the United States to improve the quality of life of people living 
        with posttraumatic stress disorder should be commended: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the goals and 
ideals of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
