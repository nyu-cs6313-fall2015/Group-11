                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the 50th anniversary of the first ascent of Mt. Everest by 
                        United States citizens.

Whereas James W. Whittaker stood on top of Mt. Everest at 1:00 p.m. on May 1, 
        1963, with Sherpa Nawang Gombu, and planted the American flag for the 
        first time on the highest point of earth;
Whereas Mr. Whittaker was a part of a team led by Swiss Mountaineer Norman 
        Dyhrenfurth, that consisted of 19 United States mountaineers, 
        scientists, writers, and photographers, who were assisted by dozens of 
        Sherpas and hundreds of porters, became the first United States team to 
        reach the peak of Mt. Everest;
Whereas Mr. Whittaker and the team stood as heroes and inspired the country 
        during a time when the Nation was consumed with the ongoing struggles of 
        the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, high unemployment, and the 
        looming war in Vietnam;
Whereas upon returning, the team was recognized at a reception in the White 
        House Rose Garden, where President John F. Kennedy presented each with 
        the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society;
Whereas Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has called Mr. Whittaker's story ``a riveting 
        saga of high adventure by one of history's greatest climbers'';
Whereas Mr. Whittaker was the first full-time employee of one of the country's 
        largest outdoor retailers, Recreational Equipment, Inc., and went on to 
        retire as its President and Chief Executive Officer after 25 years with 
        the company;
Whereas throughout his life, Mr. Whittaker has lived his life to the fullest, 
        leading numerous, high-profile climbing expeditions, including the first 
        ascent of Mt. Kennedy, which was completed with Senator Robert F. 
        Kennedy in the Canadian Yukon in 1965;
Whereas Mr. Whittaker also led the first ascent by a United States citizen of K2 
        in 1978, and the successful Mt. Everest International Peace Climb in 
        1990; and
Whereas Mr. Whittaker is the author of the best-selling, award-winning memoir, 
        ``A Life on the Edge: Memoirs of Everest and Beyond'' and has shared his 
        story in person as a motivational speaker: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates James W. Whittaker and his fellow 
        climbers on the 50th anniversary of the first ascent of Mt. 
        Everest by United States citizens;
            (2) honors Mr. Whittaker for his leadership in the outdoor 
        recreation community; and
            (3) recognizes the extraordinary feat Mr. Whittaker 
        accomplished 50 years ago and how his story has inspired 
        countless people in the Northwest and beyond.
                                 <all>
