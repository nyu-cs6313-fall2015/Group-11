                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the goals and ideals of National Middle Level Education 
                                 Month.

Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals, the Association 
        for Middle Level Education, the National Forum to Accelerate Middle 
        Grades Reform, and the National Association of Elementary School 
        Principals have declared the month of March 2013 as National Middle 
        Level Education Month;
Whereas schools that educate middle grades students play a critical function in 
        the Nation's educational system in that they are responsible for 
        educating young adolescents between the ages of 10 and 15 (grades 5 
        through 9) that are undergoing rapid and dramatic changes in their 
        physical, intellectual, social, emotional, and moral development;
Whereas each day nearly 24,000,000 young adolescents enter school deserving what 
        research and practice have shown to help middle grades students achieve, 
        including challenging and engaging instruction, teachers and 
        administrators that are knowledgeable and prepared in order to provide 
        young adolescents with a safe, challenging, and supportive learning 
        environment, and organizational structures that banish anonymity and 
        promote personalization, collaboration, and social equity;
Whereas the habits and values established during early adolescence have a 
        critical, life-long influence that directly impacts the future health 
        and welfare of the Nation;
Whereas research has found that the academic achievement of eighth grade 
        students has a larger impact on their readiness for college by the end 
        of high school than anything that happens academically in high school;
Whereas in order to improve graduation rates and prepare students to be life-
        long learners ready for college, career, and citizenship, a deeper 
        public understanding of the distinctive mission of the middle level is 
        necessary; and
Whereas the month of March 2013 has been declared as National Middle Level 
        Education Month by numerous educational groups: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Middle Level 
        Education Month;
            (2) honors and recognizes the importance of middle level 
        education and the contributions of those who educate this 
        unique age group; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Middle Level Education Month by taking opportunities 
        to visit schools that educate middle grades students and 
        celebrate the schools that are responsible for educating the 
        Nation's young adolescents.
