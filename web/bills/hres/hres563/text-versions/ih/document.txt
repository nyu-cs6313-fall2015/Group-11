  Expressing support for designation of May as ``National Asthma and 
                       Allergy Awareness Month''.

Whereas 7,100,000, or 9.5 percent, of children in the United States currently 
        have asthma, and that percentage has risen steadily since the 1980s;
Whereas 25,000,000, or 1 in 12, people in the United States have asthma, and the 
        numbers are increasing each year;
Whereas on average, in 2008 children missed 4 days of school and adults missed 5 
        days of work because of asthma;
Whereas asthma is the most common noncommunicable disease among children;
Whereas 1,800,000 individuals per year visit emergency departments because of 
        asthma's effects;
Whereas asthma costs the United States about $3,300 in medical expenses per 
        person with asthma each year from 2002 to 2007;
Whereas medical expenses associated with asthma increased from $48,600,000,000 
        in 2002 to $50,100,000,000 in 2007;
Whereas fewer than half of people with asthma report being taught how to avoid 
        triggers, which are key to the prevention of asthma attacks;
Whereas asthma is a manageable disease; and
Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National Asthma and 
        Allergy Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Asthma and 
        Allergy Awareness Month'';
            (2) encourages awareness of the prevalence of asthma and 
        allergies, including heightened prevalence among women, 
        minority, and urban demographics;
            (3) recognizes and salutes health care professionals who 
        treat asthma and allergy-related health issues;
            (4) recognizes and salutes researchers working to identify 
        asthma and allergy cures;
            (5) recognizes and reaffirms commitment to public education 
        about asthma and allergy treatment and symptoms and to 
        advancing care for both asthma and allergy conditions; and
            (6) supports investment in researching the prevention, 
        treatment, and eradication of asthma.
