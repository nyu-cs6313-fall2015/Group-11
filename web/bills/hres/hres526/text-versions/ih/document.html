                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the important work of the Meals On Wheels Association of 
 America and its member programs throughout the country in addressing 
  senior hunger and improving the quality of life for millions of our 
                      nation's seniors each year.

Whereas the Meals On Wheels Association of America is the oldest and largest 
        organization in the United States representing senior nutrition programs 
        that provide nutritious meals to people in need;
Whereas thousands of local, community-based Meals on Wheels programs provide a 
        vital lifeline to millions of men and women in cities, suburban areas, 
        and rural communities across America who are elderly, homebound, 
        disabled, frail, or otherwise vulnerable and at risk;
Whereas Meals on Wheels programs provide nutritious meals and social contact to 
        individuals who suffer from long-term chronic conditions, as well as 
        those who may just need short-term assistance;
Whereas good nutrition is essential to good health and the meals provided by 
        senior nutrition programs protect and contribute to the overall health 
        and well-being of America's seniors;
Whereas Meals on Wheels programs are proven and effective public-private 
        partnerships saving significant taxpayer dollars in avoided hospital, 
        health care and long-term care costs;
Whereas Meals on Wheels programs serve this country's over 60 population, which 
        is rapidly growing and projected to increase dramatically each year over 
        the next several decades;
Whereas the demand and need for the services Meals on Wheels programs provide 
        will continue to increase at an astounding pace;
Whereas Meals on Wheels programs are needed to free vulnerable seniors of hunger 
        and social isolation;
Whereas each March, chosen because it was during this month that the law that 
        included senior nutrition programs in the Older Americans Act of 1965 
        was enacted, Meals on Wheels programs across the country conduct local, 
        community-based ``March for Meals'' fundraising and awareness campaigns 
        to further support their services; and
Whereas Meals on Wheels programs across the country have recruited more than 
        2,000 Members of Congress, mayors, governors, local celebrities and 
        community leaders as champions to help raise awareness for senior hunger 
        and participate in ``March for Meals'' activities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the important work of the Meals On Wheels 
        Association of America and its member programs throughout the 
        country in addressing senior hunger and improving the quality 
        of life for millions of our nation's seniors each year;
            (2) recognizes the important role the Meals On Wheels 
        Association of America and its member programs throughout the 
        country's March for Meals campaigns play in increasing 
        awareness of the need for senior nutrition programs and in 
        raising non-Federal funds and soliciting volunteers to support 
        and assist these programs in accomplishing their important 
        missions;
            (3) honors the Meals On Wheels Association of America and 
        senior nutrition programs around the country for their 
        continuing hard work and dedication on behalf of our nation's 
        seniors; and
            (4) encourages Members of Congress to support their local 
        senior nutrition programs by participating in their annual 
        local March For Meals events and delivering meals to homebound 
        seniors in a community within their district or State 
        throughout the year.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
