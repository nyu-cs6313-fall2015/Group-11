                               RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the goals and ideals of November as National Alzheimer's 
                        Disease Awareness Month.

Whereas Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disease that impairs 
        an individual's memory, cognitive abilities, and behavior;
Whereas Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia;
Whereas November was first designated as National Alzheimer's Disease Month by 
        President Ronald Reagan in 1983 and was later renamed National 
        Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month;
Whereas subsequent presidents have supported this designation;
Whereas fewer than 2,000,000 Americans suffered from Alzheimer's disease in 
        1983;
Whereas more than 5,000,000 individuals are now living with Alzheimer's disease 
        in the United States;
Whereas neurological research continues to lead to advances in the treatment and 
        diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia; and
Whereas National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month serves to increase 
        awareness about the disease, its impact on the lives of those affected 
        by it, and the efforts of those seeking to cure Alzheimer's disease: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Alzheimer's 
        Disease Awareness Month;
            (2) acknowledges the tragic impact which Alzheimer's 
        disease has on the lives of individuals in the United States; 
        and
            (3) acknowledges the progress and improvements which 
        neurological research has made in the diagnosis and treatment 
        of Alzheimer's disease.
                                 <all>
