                               RESOLUTION


 
  Providing for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 12) to modernize 
   voter registration, promote access to voting for individuals with 
disabilities, protect the ability of individuals to exercise the right 
    to vote in elections for Federal office, and for other purposes.

    Resolved, That immediately upon adoption of this resolution the 
Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House 
resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the 
Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 12) to modernize voter 
registration, promote access to voting for individuals with 
disabilities, protect the ability of individuals to exercise the right 
to vote in elections for Federal office, and for other purposes. All 
points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General 
debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on House Administration. After general debate the bill 
shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. During 
consideration of the bill for amendment, the chair of the Committee of 
the Whole may accord priority in recognition for an amendment to 
restore and protect the right to vote of all of our citizens in keeping 
with the spirit and the letter of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which 
was undermined by the Shelby v. Holder decision, if offered by 
Representative Lewis of Georgia or his designee. At the conclusion of 
consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and 
report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been 
adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the 
bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion 
except one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the 
Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no 
resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House 
shall, immediately after the third daily order of business under clause 
1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further 
consideration of the bill.
