	<preamble>
		<whereas><text>Whereas March 2014 marks the third year of the crisis in Syria, which has resulted in the world’s
			 largest ongoing humanitarian disaster, and the urgent need for a
			 resolution to the conflict;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Bashar al-Assad and supporting militias, including Hezbollah, continue to carry out
			 sectarian mass atrocities, which have included mass targeted killings,
			 mass graves, the extermination of entire families, including their
			 children, incidents of ethnic cleansing, sexual violence, widespread
			 torture, aerial bombardment of residential areas, and otherwise forced
			 displacement of certain Syrian civilians especially from areas in western
			 Syria where Assad is attempting to increase the dominance of his own
			 loyalists;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government should not continue to officially recognize a regime that is
			 guilty of such vicious abuses of basic human rights on such a vast scale;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Department of State took appropriate action on March 5, 2014, in
			 restricting the movements of Assad’s loyal representative to the United
			 Nations, Bashar al-Jaafari, to within a 25-mile radius of New York City;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas approximately 140,000 people have been killed, including more than 11,000 children, many
			 more have been seriously wounded, and civilian casualties continue to
			 mount as widespread and systematic attacks on schools, hospitals, and
			 other civilian facilities persist in violation of international norms and
			 principles;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations has registered more than 2,500,000 Syrian refugees who have fled to
			 neighboring countries, while regional governments and the United Nations
			 estimate that the total number of refugees already has reached more than
			 3,000,000;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations expects the total refugee count to reach over 4,000,000 Syrians by the
			 end of 2014;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas approximately half of Syrian refugees are children, including nearly 500,000 under the age
			 of 5, and thousands have been separated from their parents and are
			 especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations estimates that over 9,000,000 civilians are in need of humanitarian
			 assistance within Syria, more than 40 percent of the country’s total
			 population, including 6,500,000 internally displaced persons;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Bashar al-Assad’s forces, supporting militias, and other parties to the conflict are
			 systematically blocking humanitarian aid delivery, including food and
			 medical care, from many civilian areas in violation of international norms
			 and principles;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations estimates that 3,000,000 Syrians are trapped in hard-to-reach or
			 besieged areas, with an estimated 250,000 cut off from assistance for over
			 a year;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the crisis has worsened already difficult conditions for Syrian women and girls, who are
			 especially vulnerable to economic hardship and gender-based violence,
			 including early marriage, forced marriage, trafficking, sexual violence,
			 or the fear of sexual violence;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas over 5,000,000 children affected by the conflict desperately need food, clean water,
			 shelter, and medical care;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas millions of Syrian children have been forced out of school, and an entire generation of
			 young Syrians are being shaped by violence, displacement, and persistent
			 lack of opportunity and are therefore at high risk of exploitation,
			 life-long underdevelopment, and radicalization;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the World Health Organization estimates that 70 percent of Syria’s medical professionals,
			 up to 80,000 people, have fled the country, while remaining professionals
			 are deliberately targeted by parties to the conflict;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas regional states, including Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt and Iraq, are hosting well over
			 2,000,000 refugees;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas despite the attention and resources refugee camps receive, most refugees from Syria, 83
			 percent regionally, do not live in formal refugee camps but rather among
			 host communities where resources and services, including health, water and
			 sanitation, electricity, and other systems are strained at the municipal
			 and national level;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas many members of the Syrian-American community, especially medical professionals, have
			 generously donated their time and money, while taking great personal risk,
			 in heroic efforts to reach those in need inside Syria with humanitarian
			 assistance;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations launched its largest appeal in its history for a single humanitarian
			 emergency in December 2013, requesting an unprecedented $6,500,000,000 in
			 2014 for the Syrian response, representing nearly half of the United
			 Nations entire global humanitarian request; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States has provided $1,700,000,000 in assistance to those suffering inside
			 Syria, as well as refugees and host communities in neighboring countries
			 and has committed to continue to increase its humanitarian contributions
			 for those affected by the conflict: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
