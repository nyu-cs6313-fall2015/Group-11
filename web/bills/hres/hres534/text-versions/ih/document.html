    (4) developing a DNA test that detects anthrax in less than 1 hour; and

    (5) continuing a tradition of helping individuals in the most need of 
help, including by deploying medical teams to earthquake-stricken Haiti;

Whereas Mayo Clinic continues to value compassion, integrity, quality, and 
        innovation in its leadership around the world; and
Whereas Mayo Clinic is considered a premiere global center of health and healing 
        dedicated to medical care, research, and education: Now, therefore, be
