 Supporting the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the 
                           right to counsel.

Whereas on March 18, 1963, the Supreme Court recognized in Gideon v. Wainwright 
        that counsel must be provided to indigent defendants in all felony 
        cases;
Whereas the Supreme Court held that providing counsel to indigent defendants in 
        all felony cases meets the essential requirements of the Sixth Amendment 
        to the United States Constitution; and
Whereas the Supreme Court held in Argersinger v. Hamlin that absent a knowing 
        and intelligent waiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense, 
        whether classified as petty, misdemeanor, or felony, unless they were 
        represented by counsel at their trial: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the Sixth Amendment to the United States 
        Constitution, the right to counsel; and
            (2) supports strategies to improve the criminal justice 
        system to ensure that indigent defendants in all felony cases 
        are adequately represented by counsel.
