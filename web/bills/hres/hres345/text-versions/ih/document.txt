 Recognizing the importance of nonprofit organizations and expressing 
support for designation of May 16, 2014, as ``National Nonprofit Day''.

Whereas an estimated 2,300,000 nonprofit organizations operate in the United 
        States;
Whereas the nonprofit sector continues to grow in size and scope;
Whereas nonprofit organizations serve a vital role in facilitating charitable 
        giving and social action;
Whereas the combined donations and volunteer hours of individuals to nonprofit 
        organizations are worth billions of dollars; and
Whereas May 16, 2014, would be an appropriate date to designate as ``National 
        Nonprofit Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of nonprofit organizations to 
        the communities they serve, the issues they support, and the 
        economy of the United States; and
            (2) supports the designation of ``National Nonprofit Day''.
                                 <all>
