                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
    practice of using gas chambers to euthanize stray cats and dogs.

Whereas approximately 3,400,000 animals are euthanized in the United States each 
        year;
Whereas approximately three percent of all cats and dogs in the United States 
        are euthanized in gas chambers each year;
Whereas 23 States have banned the use of gas chambers to euthanize animals;
Whereas several States are currently considering legislation banning the use of 
        gas chambers to euthanize animals;
Whereas the American Veterinary Medical Association does not consider euthanasia 
        through the use of gas chambers an unconditionally acceptable method of 
        euthanasia;
Whereas gas chambers cause stress in dogs and cats and cannot guarantee a humane 
        death especially for ill, young, or old dogs and cats;
Whereas gas chambers pose great dangers of significant psychological and 
        physical harm to staff and volunteers in shelters, including bites and 
        scratches while transporting animals and injuries from leaks or misuse 
        of noxious gasses;
Whereas euthanasia by injection has been proven to be more safe, cost effective, 
        and humane in numerous studies;
Whereas many cats and dogs run away from their owners each year; and
Whereas many lost cats and dogs with owners are among those euthanized in gas 
        chambers each year: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives expresses its 
dissatisfaction that the practice of using gas chambers to euthanize 
stray cats and dogs continues in the United States in the 21st century.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
