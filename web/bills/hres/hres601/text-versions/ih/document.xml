		<whereas><text>Whereas, on May 15, 2014, a Sudanese court affirmed a sentence of death by hanging for 27-year-old
			 Meriam Yahia Ibrahim Ishag, a Christian woman accused of apostasy for
			 refusing to recant her Christian faith, and ordered her to receive 100
			 lashes for adultery because under Sudan’s Shari’ah law such
			 inter-religious marriages are illegal;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Ibrahim is being held in the Omdurman Federal Women’s Prison with her 20-month-old son and
			 newborn daughter;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Department of State has designated Sudan as a <quote>Country of Particular Concern</quote> under the
			 International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/105/292">Public Law 105–292</external-xref>) based on
			 the government’s systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of
			 religious freedom since 1999;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Sudanese 1991 Criminal Code allows for death sentences for apostasy, stoning for
			 adultery, cross-amputations for theft, prison sentences for blasphemy, and
			 floggings for undefined acts of <quote>indecency</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), the
			 Government of Sudan, led by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, continues to
			 engage in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious
			 freedom or belief, imposes a restrictive interpretation of Shari’ah law on
			 Muslims and non-Muslims alike and, along with other National Congress
			 Party leaders, President al-Bashir has stated that Sudan’s new
			 constitution, when drafted, will be based on its interpretation of
			 Shari’ah;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to USCIRF, since South Sudan’s independence from Sudan in 2011, the number and
			 severity of harsh Shari’ah-based judicial decisions in Sudan has
			 increased, including sentences of amputation for theft and sentences of
			 stoning for adultery;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government has designated Sudan as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since
			 August 12, 1993, for repeatedly providing support for acts of
			 international terrorism;</text>

			 rights to (a) worship or assemble in connection with any religion or

			 acceded, provides that <quote>everyone shall have the right to freedom of
			 thought, conscience, and religion. This right shall include freedom to
			 have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either
			 individually or in community with others, and in public or private, to
			 manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and
			 teaching.</quote>;</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life found that, as of 2011, 10 percent of the 198 countries surveyed had apostasy laws
			 which can, and have been, used to punish both Muslims and non-Muslims in
			 countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Morocco, and Sudan; and</text>
		</whereas><whereas><text>Whereas people have the right to practice their faith without fear of death or persecution: Now,
