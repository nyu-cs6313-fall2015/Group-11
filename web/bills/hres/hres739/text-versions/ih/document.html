                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of the International Day of Non-
                               Violence.

Whereas the United Nations General Assembly established the International Day of 
        Non-Violence on June 15, 2007, to disseminate the message of non-
        violence, through means such as education and public awareness;
Whereas, the United Nations General Assembly has stated that ``non-violence, 
        tolerance, full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms 
        for all, democracy, development, mutual understanding and respect for 
        diversity are interlinked and mutually reinforcing'';
Whereas the annual International Day of Non-Violence celebration date, October 
        2, was chosen to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas K. Gandhi, more 
        commonly known as ``Mahatma'', which means ``great soul'';
Whereas Mahatma Gandhi was a world-renowned civil rights and spiritual leader, 
        who experienced injustices early in life, and learned to embrace the 
        principles of non-violence as a vehicle for social and political change;
Whereas Mahatma Gandhi was influenced by religious teachings in Hinduism, 
        Jainism, and Christianity in the development of his philosophy;
Whereas Mahatma Gandhi was a major influence for Martin Luther King, Jr., whose 
        emphasis on non-violence is credited with ushering in our Nation's civil 
        rights; and
Whereas people around the world commemorate the International Day of Non-
        Violence by participating in volunteer projects as a way to give back to 
        their communities: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of the International Day 
        of Non-Violence; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the International Day of Non-Violence with appropriate 
        ceremonies, programs, and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
