                               RESOLUTION


 
 Congratulating and honoring Kailash Satyarthi, recipient of the 2014 
                           Nobel Peace Prize.

Whereas the Nobel Peace Prize is an international award administered by the 
        Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden;
Whereas the Nobel Peace Price has been awarded for outstanding achievements in 
        peace since 1901;
Whereas the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a 
        group of five members appointed by the Storting, the Norwegian 
        Parliament, in Oslo, Norway, to recognize individuals who have ``done 
        the most or best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition 
        or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of 
        peace congresses'';
Whereas the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Indian children's rights 
        advocate and social activist Kailash Satyarthi for his courageous and 
        tireless efforts to combat child labor, forced labor, and trafficking;
Whereas, in his 34 years as an activist, Mr. Satyarthi has saved nearly 80,000 
        children from being forced into servitude by callous agents, 
        businessmen, landowners, and brothel owners, oftentimes placing himself 
        in severe danger;
Whereas Mr. Satyarthi founded Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the Childhood 
        Movement) in 1980, which works to rescue children who have been removed 
        from school and forced to work long hours for little to no pay in such 
        settings as factories, mines, brick kilns, and carpet-making workshops;
Whereas, in the late 1990s, Mr. Satyarthi was the lead organizer of the Global 
        March Against Child Labour, which raised awareness of the millions of 
        abused children who suffer as child laborers;
Whereas Mr. Satyarthi has long condemned and sought to hold accountable through 
        the criminal justice system in India the employers and traffickers that 
        exploit child labor;
Whereas Mr. Satyarthi also founded an international program that tags all 
        carpets made in factories certified as child labor-free;
Whereas, most recently, Mr. Satyarthi has helped turn hundreds of villages into 
        rehabilitation centers in order to teach trades to abused teenagers and 
        launched operations to rescue girls sold into abusive forced marriages; 
        and
Whereas Mr. Satyarthi's courageous campaign to end the scourge of child labor 
        represents a vitally important effort in making the world a more humane 
        and peaceful place: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) congratulates Kailash Satyarthi on receiving the 2014 
        Nobel Peace Prize, which is awarded for his outstanding 
        achievements;
            (2) honors Kailash Satyarthi for his contributions to the 
        protection of children's rights and the promotion of peace;
            (3) recognizes and condemns child labor as a form of modern 
        slavery;
            (4) states that in honoring Kailash Satyarthi, it also 
        honors all those who have worked to end child labor around the 
        globe; and
            (5) emphasizes that violations of human rights in general, 
        and the abuse of children specifically, are matters of 
        legitimate concern to all nations.
