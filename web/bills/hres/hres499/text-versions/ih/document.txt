                               RESOLUTION


 
 Condemning the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, and 
  territorial integrity by military forces of the Russian Federation.

Whereas the United States has been strongly committed to the sovereignty, 
        democratic development, and prosperity of Ukraine since the recovery of 
        its independence in 1991;
Whereas the Ukrainian people have the right to freely determine their future, 
        including their country's relationship with other countries and 
        international organizations, without interference, intimidation, or 
        coercion by other countries;
Whereas closer relations with Europe hold out the prospect of a more stable and 
        prosperous Ukraine, which would be of benefit to all countries, 
        including Russia;
Whereas the military intervention by the Russian Federation in Crimea is a 
        violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
        integrity;
Whereas this military intervention is a violation of international law, 
        including the Russian Federation's obligations under the United Nations 
        Charter;
Whereas this military intervention is a violation of the Russian Federation's 
        obligations under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, 
        in which it pledged to respect the independence and sovereignty and the 
        existing borders of Ukraine and to refrain from the threat or use of 
        force against the territorial integrity or political independence of 
        Ukraine;
Whereas by its military intervention in Ukraine, the Russian Federation has 
        violated the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act Declaration of 
        Principles Regarding Relations Between Participating States of the 
        Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe;
Whereas the Russian Federation's military intervention in Crimea represents a 
        reckless escalation of its long-standing efforts to pressure Ukraine 
        through political, diplomatic, and economic means to reduce its ties to 
        Europe and the West and force it into a closer association with Russia, 
        including through the establishment of a Eurasian Union;
Whereas the Russian Federation has used and is continuing to use coercive 
        economic measures, including the manipulation of energy prices and 
        supplies, to place political pressure on Ukraine and other countries in 
        the region;
Whereas the Government of Ukraine has exercised extraordinary restraint to date 
        in response to the use of force against it on its territory; and
Whereas the immediate deployment of international monitors from either the 
        Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe or the United 
        Nations to Crimea and in other Ukrainian regions would provide 
        transparency and objective reporting regarding threats of violence and 
        military activity, and also enhance the security of the Ukrainian people 
        in all regions: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, 
        independence, and territorial integrity by military forces of 
        the Russian Federation;
            (2) states that the military intervention by the Russian 
        Federation--
                    (A) is in breach of its obligations under the 
                United Nations Charter;
                    (B) is in violation of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum 
                on Security Assurances, in which it pledged to respect 
                the independence and sovereignty and the existing 
                borders of Ukraine and to refrain from the threat of 
                use of force against the territorial integrity or 
                political independence of Ukraine; and
                    (C) poses a threat to international peace and 
                security;
            (3) calls on the Russian Federation to remove all of its 
        military forces from Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, other than at 
        those operating in accordance with its 1997 agreement on the 
        Status and Conditions of the Black Sea Fleet Stationing on the 
        Territory of Ukraine, and to refrain from interference in all 
        regions of Ukraine;
            (4) declares that the Ukrainian people have the right to 
        determine their own future free from outside interference;
            (5) commends the Ukrainian Government for its continued 
        restraint and avoidance of military provocations;
            (6) calls on the Ukrainian Government to continue to 
        protect the rights of all minority populations within Ukraine 
        and make clear that it represents all Ukrainian citizens;
            (7) calls on all Ukrainians to respect the legitimate 
        government authorities in all parts of Ukraine, including in 
        eastern and southern Ukraine;
            (8) calls for the deployment of independent monitors from 
        the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 
        Crimea and other areas of Ukraine;
            (9) calls upon the President and the leaders of the other 
        democratic states to not attend the G8 summit in Sochi, Russia 
        and to consider expelling Russia from the group, given its 
        international aggression and internal repression that are 
        inconsistent with democratic standards;
            (10) calls on the Administration to work with our European 
        allies and other countries to impose visa, financial, trade, 
        and other sanctions on senior Russian Federation officials, 
        majority state-owned banks and commercial organizations, and 
        other state agencies, as appropriate;
            (11) states that the United States should participate with 
        its European allies and other countries in a joint effort to 
        provide the Ukrainian government with financial, economic, and 
        technical assistance, including asset recovery, to assist an 
        economic recovery program that includes fundamental reforms;
            (12) calls on the United States, its European allies, and 
        other countries and international organizations to provide 
        assistance to ensure that new elections scheduled for May 2014 
        are free, fair, and in full accordance with international 
        standards;
            (13) calls on the United States and its European allies and 
        other countries to develop a long-term strategy to support 
        economic development in Ukraine, including enhanced 
        relationships with Western countries, organizations and 
        institutions;
            (14) supports efforts by Ukraine to achieve energy 
        independence; and
            (15) affirms the right of all countries in the region to 
        exercise their sovereign rights within their internationally 
        recognized borders free from outside intervention and to 
        conduct their foreign policy in accordance with their 
        determination of the best interests of their peoples.
