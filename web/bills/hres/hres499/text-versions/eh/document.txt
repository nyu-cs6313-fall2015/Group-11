H. Res. 499

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                        March 11, 2014.
Whereas the United States has been strongly committed to the sovereignty, 
        democratic development, and prosperity of Ukraine since it secured its 
        independence from the Soviet Union in 1991;
Whereas on January 29, 2014, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
        Representatives agreed to House Resolution 447, supporting the 
        democratic and European aspirations of the people of Ukraine and their 
        right to choose their own future free of intimidation and fear, which 
        resolution was agreed to by the House of Representatives on February 10, 
        2014;
Whereas the Ukrainian people have the right to freely determine their future, 
        including their country's relationship with other countries and 
        international organizations, without interference, intimidation, or 
        coercion by other countries;
Whereas closer relations with Europe hold out the prospect of a more stable and 
        prosperous Ukraine, which would be of benefit to all countries, 
        including Russia;
Whereas the military intervention by the Russian Federation in Crimea is a 
        violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial 
        integrity;
Whereas this military intervention is a violation of international law, 
        including the Russian Federation's obligations under the United Nations 
        Charter;
Whereas this military intervention is a violation of the Russian Federation's 
        obligations under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, 
        in which it pledged to respect the independence and sovereignty and the 
        existing borders of Ukraine and to refrain from the threat or use of 
        force against the territorial integrity or political independence of 
        Ukraine;
Whereas by its military intervention in Ukraine, the Russian Federation has 
        violated the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act Declaration of 
        Principles Regarding Relations Between Participating States of the 
        Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe;
Whereas the Russian Federation's military intervention in Crimea represents a 
        reckless escalation of its long-standing efforts to pressure Ukraine 
        through political, diplomatic, and economic means to reduce its ties to 
        Europe and the West and force it into a closer association with Russia, 
        including through the establishment of a Eurasian Union;
Whereas the Russian Federation has used and is continuing to use coercive 
        economic measures, including the manipulation of energy prices and 
        supplies, and trade restrictions to place political pressure on Ukraine 
        and other countries in the region;
Whereas the Government of Ukraine has exercised extraordinary restraint to date 
        in response to the use of force against it on its territory;
Whereas the instability in Ukraine has forced 230 Peace Corps volunteers to 
        leave Ukraine; and
Whereas the immediate deployment of international monitors from either the 
        Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe or the United 
        Nations to Crimea and in other Ukrainian regions would provide 
        transparency and objective reporting regarding threats of violence and 
        military activity, and regarding civil and political rights, and also 
        enhance the security of the Ukrainian people in all regions: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, 
        and territorial integrity by military forces of the Russian Federation;
            (2) states that the military intervention by the Russian 
        Federation--
                    (A) is in breach of its obligations under the United Nations 
                Charter;
                    (B) is in violation of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on 
                Security Assurances, in which it pledged to respect the 
                independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine 
                and to refrain from the threat of use of force against the 
                territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine; and
                    (C) poses a threat to international peace and security;
            (3) calls on the Russian Federation to remove all of its military 
        forces from Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, other than those operating in 
        strict accordance with its 1997 agreement on the Status and Conditions 
        of the Black Sea Fleet Stationing on the Territory of Ukraine, and to 
        refrain from interference in all regions of Ukraine, including by ending

            (10) calls upon the President and the leaders of other democratic 
        states to boycott the G-8 summit in Sochi, Russia, to convene a G-7 
        summit in June 2014 outside of Russia that does not include Russia, and 
        to consider expelling Russia from the group, given its record of 
        international aggression, domestic repression, and human rights records 
        that are inconsistent with democratic standards;
            (11) calls on the Administration to work with our European allies
