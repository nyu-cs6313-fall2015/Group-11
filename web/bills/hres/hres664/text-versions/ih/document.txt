                               RESOLUTION


 
  Providing for the arrest of Lois G. Lerner to answer the charge of 
                         contempt of Congress.

Whereas Lois G. Lerner, former Director, Exempt Organizations, Internal Revenue 
        Service, has been found to be in contempt of Congress for willfully and 
        intentionally refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena duly 
        issued by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, thereby 
        obstructing the Congress in the lawful exercise of its constitutionally 
        mandated legislative powers;
Whereas such behavior is an insult to the dignity of the House of 
        Representatives, an attack upon the integrity of its proceedings, works 
        violence upon the rights of the House collectively, and therefore 
        implicates the long-recognized inherent power of the House to punish and 
        commit for contempt, privileged under the Constitution;
Whereas recent history with similarly contumacious and insolent witnesses such 
        as Eric Himpton Holder, Junior, strongly suggests that the present 
        statutory judicial rubric set up to punish and reform such insubordinate 
        and obstructionist witnesses would be ineffective in this case, as it is 
        likely that the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia would refuse 
        to perform his lawful duty to bring the offending contemnor Lerner 
        before a Grand Jury and prosecute the same for her misconduct pursuant 
        to section 104 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (2 U.S.C. 
        194) and section 102 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (2 
        U.S.C. 192);
Whereas the executive and judicial branches' prolonged and dawdling failure to 
        prosecute Attorney General Holder's insolent contempt of the 112th 
        Congress strongly suggests that a like proceeding against contemnor 
        Lerner would be similarly futile, and the threat of such prosecution has 
        clearly been insufficient to encourage contemnor Lerner to be honest and 
        candid with the Congress regarding the heinous actions of the Internal 
        Revenue Service: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Speaker issue his warrant, directed to the 
Sergeant-at-Arms, or his deputy, commanding him to arrest and take into 
custody forthwith, wherever to be found, the body of Lois G. Lerner, 
and bring her to the bar of the House without delay to answer to the 
charge of contempt of its authority, breach of its privileges, and 
gross and wanton insult to the integrity of its proceedings, and in the 
meantime keep the body of Lerner in his custody in the common jail of 
the District of Columbia, subject to the further order of the House. 
While in custody, Lerner shall enjoy no special privileges beyond those 
extended to her fellow inmates, shall not access any computer or 
telephone, and shall not be visited by anyone other than her counsel, 
clergy, physician, or family.
                                 <all>
