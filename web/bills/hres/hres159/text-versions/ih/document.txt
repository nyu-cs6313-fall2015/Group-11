Whereas there are currently more than 100,000 osteopathic physicians and 
        osteopathic medical students in the United States;
Whereas osteopathic physicians have made significant contributions to the United

        Andrew Taylor Still, M.D., D.O., in 1874;
Whereas osteopathic physicians have treated United States presidents, Olympic 
        athletes, contributed to the fight against AIDS and the fight for civil 
        rights, and served on national health care panels;
Whereas osteopathic physicians are fully licensed to prescribe medicine and 
        practice in all specialty areas of medicine, including surgery;
Whereas osteopathic physicians are trained to consider the health of the whole 
        person and use their hands to help diagnose and treat their patients;
Whereas osteopathic physicians and medical students in the United States are 
        dedicated to improving the health of their communities through education 
        and awareness-based efforts, as well as by delivering quality health 
        services;
Whereas the citizens of the United States recognize the need for osteopathic 
        physicians who are committed to bringing attention to improving the 
        health of people in the United States, regardless of age, income level, 
        or ethnicity; and
Whereas the week of April 14, 2013, through April 20, 2013, would be an 
        appropriate week to designate as National Osteopathic Medicine Week: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of National Osteopathic Medicine Week.
