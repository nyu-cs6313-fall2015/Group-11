                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of May 29, 2014, as a national day 
of remembrance honoring the late President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 
                  35th President of the United States.

Whereas President Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts;
Whereas he served his country honorably in World War II, in the Navy, narrowly 
        escaping death in 1943 when his PT boat was sunk by a destroyer;
Whereas he bravely led survivors to safety, despite his own grave injuries and 
        was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, as well as a Purple Heart, 
        for his leadership and courage;
Whereas he heeded the call to public service and was elected to serve 
        Massachusetts' 11th Congressional District in 1946, and served three 
        terms in the U.S. House of Representatives;
Whereas then-Congressman Kennedy would promote the interests of his working 
        class district by serving on the distinguished Committees on Education, 
        the District of Columbia, and the Joint Committee on Labor-Management 
        Relations, and as a House Member, introducing legislation to support 
        primary and secondary education, strengthening employment protections, 
        and protecting housing rights for returning veterans;
Whereas he was then elected to serve in the U.S. Senate in 1952 and served two 
        terms, representing the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts;
Whereas then-Senator Kennedy served on the Committees for Labor and Public 
        Welfare, Government Operations, Foreign Relations, and the Joint 
        Economic Committee;
Whereas he authored Profiles in Courage to tell the stories of political leaders 
        who defied public opinion in order to vote their conscience and was 
        awarded the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1957;
Whereas he was then elected President of the United States in 1960, being the 
        youngest person elected to our Nation's highest office;
Whereas he led the way for Catholic-Americans to achieve the highest office in 
        the land as the first Catholic President of the United States;
Whereas in his inaugural address, he challenged the Nation and its citizens to, 
        ``Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your 
        country'', and asked the nations of the world to come together to fight 
        the ``common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war 
        itself'';
Whereas the President understood the importance of service to others, and that 
        the strength of the United States rests not in its military prowess, but 
        in its generosity to our neighbors across the globe, he sent young 
        Americans out to serve the world in the first generation of Peace Corps 
        volunteers;
Whereas the President sought to make good on the 100-year-old promise of the 
        Civil War by finally bringing true equality to all Americans through a 
        Civil Rights Act;
Whereas the President strove to make the United States of America the most 
        technologically advanced country on Earth, and in doing so inspired an 
        entire generation of young people to reach for the stars, by putting us 
        on the path to sending a man to the moon;
Whereas we also honor the Kennedy family for their commitment to the Nation and 
        the generations they inspired to also enter into public service; and
Whereas May 29, 2014, would be an appropriate date for a national day of 
        remembrance in honor of John Fitzgerald Kennedy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of a national day of remembrance in honor of John 
Fitzgerald Kennedy.
