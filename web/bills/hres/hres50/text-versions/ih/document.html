                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of February 4, 2013, as National 
                         Cancer Prevention Day.

Whereas National Cancer Prevention Day is a day to remind us that when looking 
        at cancer we need to look at prevention and reducing risks for human 
        health and the environment;
Whereas when we work to prevent cancer risks, it impacts human health, the 
        environment, and the economy;
Whereas cancer is one of the leading causes of death around the world and has 
        touched the lives of nearly everyone, either directly or indirectly;
Whereas the disease is the cause of nearly 1 out of every 4 deaths in the United 
        States;
Whereas by the end of 2013, approximately 1,660,290 new cases are expected to be 
        diagnosed across the United States;
Whereas almost 1,600 cancer-related deaths per day are expected throughout the 
        year for a total of approximately 580,350; and
Whereas February 4, 2013, would be an appropriate date to designate as Cancer 
        Prevention Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of National Cancer Prevention 
        Day;
            (2) recognizes all efforts to raise the awareness for the 
        reduction of cancer risks; and
            (3) recognizes the devastating effect cancer has on 
        families and wishes to expand knowledge, encourage early 
        detection, and work with friends in the medical and scientific 
        fields to put an end to this deadly disease.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
