 Expressing support for designation of the week beginning on November 
             11, 2013, as National School Psychology Week.

Whereas all children and youth learn best when they are healthy, supported, and 
        receive an education that meets their individual needs;
Whereas schools can more effectively ensure that all students are ready and able 
        to learn if schools meet all the needs of each student;
Whereas learning and development are directly linked to the mental health of 
        children, and a supportive learning environment is an optimal place to 
        promote mental health;
Whereas sound psychological principles are critical to proper instruction and 
        learning, social and emotional development, prevention and early 
        intervention, and support for a culturally diverse student population;
Whereas school psychologists are specially trained to deliver mental health 
        services and academic support that lowers barriers to learning and 
        allows teachers to teach more effectively;
Whereas school psychologists facilitate collaboration that helps parents and 
        educators identify and reduce risk factors, promote protective factors, 
        create safe schools, and access community resources;
Whereas school psychologists are trained to assess barriers to learning, utilize 
        data-based decisionmaking, implement research driven prevention and 
        intervention strategies, evaluate outcomes, and improve accountability;
Whereas State educational agencies and other State entities credential more than 
        35,000 school psychologists who practice in schools in the United States 
        as key professionals that promote the learning and mental health of all 
        children;
Whereas the National Association of School Psychologists establishes and 
        maintains high standards for training, practice, and school psychologist 
        credentialing, in collaboration with organizations such as the American 
        Psychological Association, that promote effective and ethical services 
        by school psychologists to children, families, and schools;
Whereas the National Association of School Psychologists has a Model for 
        Comprehensive and Integrated School Psychological Services that promotes 
        standards for the consistent delivery of school psychological services 
        to all students in need;
Whereas the people of the United States should recognize the vital role school 
        psychologists play in the personal and academic development of the 
        Nation's children; and
Whereas the week beginning on November 11, 2013, would be an appropriate week to 
        designate as National School Psychology Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of National School Psychology 
        Week;
            (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of school 
        psychologists to the success of students in schools across the 
        United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities that 
        promote awareness of the vital role school psychologists play 
        in schools, in the community, and in helping students develop 
        into successful and productive members of society.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
