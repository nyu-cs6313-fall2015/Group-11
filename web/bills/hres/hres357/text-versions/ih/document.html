                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Historically Black Colleges 
                         and Universities Week.

Whereas, before the Civil War, an education, much less a college education, was 
        out of reach for most African-Americans as there were few institutions 
        of higher education focused on meeting the intellectual curiosity and 
        spurring the academic growth of African-American students;
Whereas, as the United States began to heal from the wounds of the Civil War and 
        the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution 
        were ratified, a newly freed people demanded a freed mind, and 
        courageous leaders began expanding institutions of higher education that 
        are now known as the Historically Black Colleges and Universities;
Whereas, for more than a century and a half, Historically Black Colleges and 
        Universities have helped build a middle class and produced many 
        preeminent thinkers and entrepreneurs, doctors and scientists, judges 
        and lawyers, athletes, members of the Armed Forces, and educators;
Whereas students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities banded together 
        as part of the Civil Rights movement that pushed Americans closer to 
        true freedom and equality for all;
Whereas, at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, generations of 
        students not only gained the education and skills necessary for the 
        workforce, but also cultivated an understanding of history and knowledge 
        of self that are necessary in life;
Whereas, as the United States works toward a goal of having the highest 
        proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020, Historically Black 
        Colleges and Universities continue to provide pathways of opportunity 
        for students;
Whereas ensuring that Historically Black Colleges and Universities have the 
        resources they need to help students reach their fullest potential 
        remains a top priority, including through the provision of funds for 
        infrastructure and technology improvements and through increased 
        availability of Pell Grants; and
Whereas the President has issued a proclamation recognizing September 22 through 
        September 28, 2013, as National Historically Black Colleges and 
        Universities Week to pay tribute to the legacies of these proud 
        institutions of higher education: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Historically 
        Black Colleges and Universities Week; and
            (2) calls upon educators, public officials, professional 
        organizations, corporations, and all Americans to observe such 
        week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to 
        acknowledge the contributions that Historically Black Colleges 
        and Universities and their students and alumni have made to the 
        United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
