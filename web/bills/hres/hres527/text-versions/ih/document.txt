                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of National Public Health Week.

Whereas the week of April 7, 2014, through April 13, 2014, is National Public 
        Health Week, and the theme for 2014 is ``Public Health: Start Here'';
Whereas since 1995, public health organizations have used National Public Health 
        Week to educate the public, policymakers, and public health 
        professionals about issues that are important to improving the health of 
        the people of the United States;
Whereas the public health system that keeps our communities healthy and safe is 
        changing as technologies advance, public attitudes toward health shift, 
        and more health and safety options become available;
Whereas the value of a strong public health system is in the air we breathe, the 
        water we drink, the food we eat, and the places where we all live, 
        learn, work, and play;
Whereas public health professionals help communities prepare for, withstand, and 
        recover from the impact of a natural or man-made disaster;
Whereas according to the Institute of Medicine, despite being one of the 
        wealthiest nations in the world, the United States still ranks below 
        many other economically prosperous countries in life expectancy, infant 
        mortality, and low birth weight and many other indicators of healthy 
        life;
Whereas studies have shown that small strategic investments in prevention could 
        result in significant savings in health care costs;
Whereas each 10-percent increase in local public health spending contributes to 
        a 6.9-percent decrease in infant deaths, a 3.2-percent decrease in 
        cardiovascular deaths, a 1.4-percent decrease in deaths due to diabetes, 
        and a 1.1-percent decrease in cancer deaths;
Whereas in communities across the country, more people are changing the way they 
        care for their health by avoiding tobacco use, eating healthier, 
        becoming more physically active, and preventing unintentional injuries 
        at home and in the workplace; and
Whereas by adequately supporting public health and prevention, we can continue 
        to transform a health system focused on treating illness to focus on 
        preventing disease and promoting wellness: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Public Health 
        Week;
            (2) recognizes the efforts of public health professionals, 
        the Federal Government, States, Tribes, municipalities, local 
        communities, and individuals in preventing disease and injury;
            (3) recognizes the role of public health in improving the 
        health of people in the United States;
            (4) encourages increased efforts and resources to improve 
        the health of people in the United States to create the 
        healthiest nation in one generation through--
                    (A) greater opportunities to improve community 
                health and prevent disease and injury; and
                    (B) strengthening of the public health system of 
                the United States; and
            (5) encourages the people of the United States to learn 
        about the role of the public health system in improving health 
        in the United States.
                                 <all>
