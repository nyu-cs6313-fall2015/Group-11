                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the need for Compton Community College to receive an 
                    expedited accreditation process.

Whereas Compton Community College lost its accreditation on August 22, 2006;
Whereas Compton Community College has since partnered with El Camino College, an 
        accredited school of good standing, to offer accredited courses to 6,780 
        students;
Whereas Compton Community College and the Compton Community College District 
        Board of Trustees, in partnership with the board, faculty, and staff at 
        El Camino College, are dedicated to providing quality educational 
        programs and services to the 5 Compton Community College District 
        Trustee Area communities of Compton, Carson, Lynwood, Paramount, Watts/
        Willowbrook, and neighboring cities;
Whereas Compton Community College is a source of community pride, a positive 
        stimulus for students and families, and supports the continued 
        development of the surrounding communities;
Whereas Compton Community College has a proud history, having functioned as one 
        of the primary providers of high quality post-secondary education for 
        persons of color in the greater Los Angeles County region for over 
        three-quarters of a century, from 1927 until 2006;
Whereas the Compton Community College District Board of Trustees, looking toward 
        the re-establishment of Compton Community College's proud history, has 
        hired Dr. Keith Curry, a highly regarded member of the academic 
        community, to lead in their pursuit of accreditation as Chief Executive 
        Officer of the Compton Community College District;
Whereas Compton Community College is under review for accredited status and has 
        worked with schools of good standing and the Accrediting Commission for 
        Community and Junior Colleges; and
Whereas Compton Community College has endeavored in earnest to make necessary 
        reforms to prove itself qualified for accreditation, and has earned 
        consideration to once again be an accredited, self-determining and 
        excellent academic program: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the House of Representatives--
                    (A) recognizes the excellence of Compton Community 
                College; and
                    (B) strongly supports its faculty and students 
                through continued higher education, life-long 
                excellence, and self-determination; and
            (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
        Compton Community College should receive an expedited 
        accreditation process.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
