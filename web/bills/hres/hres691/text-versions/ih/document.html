    Supporting the goals and ideals of National Community Gardening 
                            Awareness Month.

Whereas countless American families live with hunger every day;
Whereas countless American families do not have access to fresh produce in their 
        neighborhoods;
Whereas community gardens conserve limited resources and promote sustainability;
Whereas community gardens provide an important and nutritious source of fresh 
        produce donations for local food pantries and social service agencies;
Whereas community gardens enable individuals to gain control over the quality, 
        variety, and cost of their food supply;
Whereas community gardening encourages Americans of diverse cultural and 
        economic backgrounds to work together, foster a better sense of 
        community, and improve the quality of their lives;
Whereas community-based youth and school gardening programs encourage personal 
        self-esteem and a healthy attitude toward learning;
Whereas community gardening and greening projects provide a catalyst for 
        neighborhood and community development;
Whereas community gardens reduce city heat and preserve open spaces for both 
        present and future generations;
Whereas community gardens and other green spaces provide a more livable 
        environment in American municipalities and present a positive local 
        image to a community's residents and visitors; and
Whereas August is an appropriate month to designate as National Community 
        Gardening Awareness Month: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the goals and 
ideals of National Community Gardening Awareness Month, including--
            (1) raising awareness about the importance of community 
        gardens and urban agriculture;
            (2) improving access to public land for the creation of 
        sustainable food projects;
            (3) encouraging further growth of community gardens and 
        other opportunities that increase food self-reliance, improve 
        fitness, contribute to a cleaner environment, and enhance 
        community development; and
            (4) supporting cooperative efforts among Federal, State, 
        and local governments and nonprofit organizations to promote 
        the development and expansion of community gardens and to 
        increase their accessibility to disadvantaged population 
        groups.
