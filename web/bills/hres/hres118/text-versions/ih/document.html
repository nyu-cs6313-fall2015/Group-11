 Supporting the goals and ideals of Professional Social Work Month and 
                         World Social Work Day.

Whereas the social work profession has been instrumental in achieving civil 
        rights and human rights advances in the United States and across the 
        globe for more than a century;
Whereas the primary mission of social work is to enhance human well-being and 
        help meet the basic needs of all people, especially the most vulnerable;
Whereas programs and services provided by professional social workers are 
        essential elements of the United States social safety net;
Whereas social workers make a critical impact in adolescent and youth 
        development, aging and family caregiving, child protection and family 
        services, health care navigation, mental and behavioral health 
        treatment, military and veterans assistance, nonprofit management and 
        community development, and poverty reduction;
Whereas social workers function as specialists, consultants, private 
        practitioners, educators, community leaders, policymakers, and 
        researchers;
Whereas social workers influence many different organizations and human service 
        systems and are employed in workplaces ranging from private and public 
        agencies, hospices and hospitals, schools and clinics, to businesses and 
        corporations, military units, elected offices, think tanks, and 
        foundations;
Whereas social workers seek to improve social functioning and social conditions 
        for people in emotional, psychological, economic, and physical need;
Whereas social workers are experts in care coordination, case management, and 
        therapeutic treatment for biopsychosocial issues, and have roles in more 
        than 50 different fields of practice;
Whereas social workers believe that a Nation's strength depends on the ability 
        of the majority of individuals to lead productive and healthy lives;
Whereas social workers help people, who are often navigating major life 
        challenges, find hope and new options for achieving their maximum 
        potential;
Whereas social workers identify and address gaps in social systems that impede 
        full participation by individuals or groups in society; and
Whereas March is recognized as Professional Social Work Month and World Social 
        Work Day is recognized on March 20, 2013: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Professional Social 
        Work Month and World Social Work Day;
            (2) acknowledges the diligent efforts of individuals and 
        groups who promote the importance of social work and observe 
        Professional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day;
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to engage in 
        appropriate ceremonies and activities to promote further 
        awareness of the life-changing role which social workers play; 
        and
            (4) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the 
        millions of caring individuals who have chosen to serve their 
        communities through social work.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
