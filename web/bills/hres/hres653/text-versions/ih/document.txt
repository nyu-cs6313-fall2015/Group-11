                               RESOLUTION


 
             Recognizing the 45th anniversary of Stonewall.

Whereas the Stonewall Inn opened on or about March 18, 1967, at 51-53 
        Christopher Street in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York 
        City, New York;
Whereas the Stonewall Inn was a bar primarily patronized by a diverse cross-
        section of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community and it 
        became a very popular institution;
Whereas at around 1:20 a.m. on June 28, 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn, 
        closing the bar and forcing patrons outside;
Whereas such raids were among the many ways in which government harassed and 
        discriminated against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
        transgender community during this period, which included, for example, 
        prohibiting dancing with a person of the same sex or wearing clothing 
        more typical for another gender, terminating one's employment, and using 
        entrapment to arrest people;
Whereas early on the morning of June 28, 1969, after the raid, years of 
        frustration and anger among members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
        transgender community at being harassed and unfairly targeted by 
        government boiled over into a conflict with police;
Whereas thousands returned to the Stonewall Inn on the night of June 28, 1969, 
        to express their support of basic freedoms, equality, and fair treatment 
        for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans, chanting such 
        slogans as ``Gay Power'', ``We Want Freedom Now'', and ``Equality For 
        Homosexuals'';
Whereas protests occurred again around the Stonewall Inn on the night of July 2, 
        1969;
Whereas the series of protests at the Stonewall Inn, often referred to as 
        ``Stonewall'', marked a watershed event in which lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
        and transgender Americans dramatically showed a growing determination to 
        publicly resist government discrimination and harassment;
Whereas Stonewall sparked a remarkable increase in activism and action by 
        lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans across the country to 
        advocate for equal rights;
Whereas, on June 28, 1970, thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender 
        Americans took part in the Christopher Street Liberation Day march from 
        Greenwich Village to Central Park to mark the first anniversary of 
        Stonewall;
Whereas people in Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco also marched or 
        gathered on June 27-28, 1970, to remember the first anniversary of 
        Stonewall;
Whereas in 1989, the section of Christopher Street in front of the Stonewall Inn 
        was renamed ``Stonewall Place'';
Whereas in 1999, the building at 51-53 Christopher Street that used to be the 
        Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park, and the immediately surrounding area 
        were listed on the National Register of Historic Places;
Whereas in 2000, the building at 51-53 Christopher Street that used to be the 
        Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park, and the immediately surrounding area 
        were listed as a National Historic Landmark;
Whereas inspired by Stonewall, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride 
        parades and festivals occur in cities across the country and the world 
        every June;
Whereas in recognition of Stonewall, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender 
        Pride Month is celebrated every June; and
Whereas a great deal of progress has been made in achieving equal rights for 
        lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans since Stonewall 
        occurred 45 years ago, but much work remains to be done: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the 45th anniversary of Stonewall;
            (2) honors those who participated during Stonewall and 
        since that time in the civil rights struggle of lesbian, gay, 
        bisexual, and transgender Americans; and
            (3) recommits itself to protecting and providing equal 
        rights for all Americans, including those who are lesbian, gay, 
        bisexual, or transgender.
                                 <all>
