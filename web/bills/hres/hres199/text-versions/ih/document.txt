                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of May 2013 as ``National Celiac 
                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas celiac disease is one of the most common genetic conditions in the 
        world;
Whereas 1 in 133 people in the United States, the equivalent of 1 percent of the 
        Nation's population, has celiac disease;
Whereas 95 percent of people in the United States with celiac disease remain 
        undiagnosed;
Whereas the grains wheat, rye, and barley contain a protein which triggers an 
        immune response in persons with celiac disease, causing damage to the 
        lining of the small intestine;
Whereas the only course of treatment for celiac disease is strict adherence to 
        the medically prescribed gluten-free diet;
Whereas individuals with celiac disease may have a range of symptoms including 
        anemia, weight loss, abdominal pain, osteoporosis, short stature, 
        diarrhea, constipation, depression, and migraines;
Whereas the length of time for an adult to be diagnosed with celiac disease is 6 
        years from the onset of symptoms;
Whereas celiac disease is a serious life-long condition that affects children, 
        women, and men in every age group;
Whereas delays in the diagnosis of celiac disease result in increased health 
        care costs to patients, employers, and the Federal Government;
Whereas other serious autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, 
        systemic lupus, and Sjogren's syndrome are associated with delays in the 
        diagnosis of celiac disease;
Whereas 10 percent of persons with type 1 diabetes have celiac disease;
Whereas individuals with Down syndrome are at increased risk of having celiac 
        disease;
Whereas 30 percent of new diagnoses occur in persons over the age of 60;
Whereas 10 percent of people with celiac disease suffer from associated 
        neurological conditions such as peripheral neuropathy and ataxia;
Whereas the United States will host the 15th International Celiac Disease 
        Symposium (ICDS) in Chicago, Illinois, in September 2013;
Whereas the global conference will bring together experts in the study, 
        treatment, and management of celiac disease and gluten-related 
        disorders;
Whereas the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 mandated 
        the establishment of Federal standards for gluten-free foods to aid 
        persons with celiac disease;
Whereas individuals with celiac disease need basic information about food 
        product ingredients to effectively manage their chronic health 
        condition; and
Whereas the 2004 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference 
        on Celiac Disease found that consultation with a skilled dietitian and 
        identification and treatment of nutritional deficiencies were key 
        elements in the management of celiac disease: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Celiac Awareness 
        Month'';
            (2) recognizes the efforts of advocates and organizations 
        that encourage awareness, promote research, and provide 
        education, support, and hope to those impacted by celiac 
        disease;
            (3) supports research funding to find a cure for celiac 
        disease; and
            (4) supports and encourages all people in the United States 
        to observe ``National Celiac Awareness Month'' with appropriate 
        events and activities.
                                 <all>
