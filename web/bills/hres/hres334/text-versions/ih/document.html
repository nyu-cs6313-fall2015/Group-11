                               RESOLUTION


 
 Condemning the attack that occurred at the Oak Creek Sikh Gurdwara on 
   August 5, 2012, and honoring the memory of those who died in the 
                                attack.

Whereas on Sunday, August 5, 2012, a mass shooting took place, fueled by 
        intolerance, killing 6 worshipers at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, a 
        Gurdwara, in Oak Creek, Wisconsin;
Whereas the attack occurred as members of the congregation prepared langar, a 
        free community meal served to all visitors to Gurdwaras, regardless of 
        their race, religion, sex, or social background;
Whereas 4 individuals were injured including a responding officer, Lieutenant 
        Brian Murphy, who was shot 15 times at close range;
Whereas Lieutenant Brian Murphy and all the first responders to the Oak Creek 
        Gurdwara demonstrated great courage in their quick response to the 
        shooting, ultimately saving lives;
Whereas in the United States, Sikhs have endured high levels of stereotyping, 
        bullying, and violence, all of which rose dramatically in the wake of 
        the attacks of September 11, 2001;
Whereas the Associated Press reported that more than 700 such incidents of 
        intolerance targeting Sikhs took place over the last decade;
Whereas the Oak Creek shooting was one of the most lethal attacks on a place of 
        worship in the United States since the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street 
        Baptist Church and another sad example of violence and intolerance 
        against Sikhs;
Whereas the Sikh community responded to the shooting in Oak Creek with 
        compassion and stayed true to the Sikh principle of Chardi Kala, 
        remaining in high spirits;
Whereas although the effects of this shooting will be felt for years to come, 
        the Oak Creek community will continue to overcome the tragedy and become 
        stronger than before with a renewed sense of oneness, understanding, and 
        cooperation; and
Whereas the August 5, 2012, shooting was not just a Sikh tragedy, but an 
        American tragedy: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the horrific 
        attack that occurred at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin on August 
        5, 2012;
            (2) honors the memory of Suveg Singh Khattra, Satwant Singh 
        Kaleka, Ranjit Singh, Sita Singh, Paramjit Kaur, and Prakash 
        Singh, who died in the attack;
            (3) offers its heartfelt condolences to the families, 
        friends, and loved ones of those who died in the attack;
            (4) applauds the bravery of Lieutenant Brian Murphy and 
        other first responders who prevented the gunman from 
        potentially taking more lives and quickly treated wounded 
        individuals; and
            (5) condemns intolerance, including religious and racial 
        discrimination, and calls for continued vigilance against 
        violence.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
