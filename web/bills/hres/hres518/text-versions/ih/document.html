                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             March 13, 2014

 Mr. Ellison (for himself, Mr. Grijalva, Ms. McCollum, and Mr. Nolan) 
submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee 
                   on Oversight and Government Reform

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for designation of March 2014 as ``Multiple System 
    Atrophy Awareness Month'' to increase public awareness of this 
   progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the autonomic 
                         functions of the body.

Whereas Multiple System Atrophy is a fatal neurological disease diagnosed in 
        approximately 15,000 patients in the United States;
Whereas as many as 35,000 more patients in the United States with Multiple 
        System Atrophy are misdiagnosed with other more recognizable 
        neurodegenerative disorders;
Whereas patients with Multiple System Atrophy lose the ability to walk, talk, 
        chew, swallow, and even breathe over the course of a few years;
Whereas the incidence of Multiple System Atrophy in the United States has 
        increased in recent years;
Whereas no specific risk factors or causes of Multiple System Atrophy have been 
        identified;
Whereas there is currently no cure for Multiple System Atrophy;
Whereas the lack of awareness about Multiple System Atrophy has hindered 
        research and the ability of researchers to obtain funding for their 
        work;
Whereas public support and greater awareness of the need for research funding 
        can aid in the discovery of the cause of and a cure for Multiple System 
        Atrophy; and
Whereas March 2014 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``Multiple 
        System Atrophy Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``Multiple System Atrophy Awareness Month'' to increase 
public awareness of this progressive neurodegenerative disorder that 
affects the autonomic functions of the body.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
