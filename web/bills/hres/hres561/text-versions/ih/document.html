                               RESOLUTION


 
    Marking the 60th anniversary of the United States Supreme Court 
                 decision Brown v. Board of Education.

Whereas May 17, 2014, marks the 60th anniversary of the United States Supreme 
        Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954);
Whereas Brown v. Board of Education overturned Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 
        (1896);
Whereas in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that ``Separate 
        educational facilities are inherently unequal,'' and that segregation of 
        schools violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment; and
Whereas Brown v. Board of Education was a major milestone in the 20th century 
        civil rights movement: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives marks the 60th 
anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), which 
signaled the end of State-sanctioned segregation of schools in the 
United States, so that it is unlawful to deny access to public 
facilities on the basis of race.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
