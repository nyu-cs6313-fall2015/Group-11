                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing support for designation of December 3, 2014, as the 
                    ``National Day of 3D Printing''.

Whereas additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a process by which 
        digital 3D design data is used to build up a component in layers by 
        depositing material;
Whereas 3D printing creates an object layer by layer, greatly reducing waste and 
        increasing efficiency compared to traditional manufacturing techniques;
Whereas 3D printing has grown exponentially over the last several years;
Whereas the United States is a world leader in advanced manufacturing, and has a 
        history of design innovation;
Whereas public-private partnerships that promote advanced manufacturing, such as 
        the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute and other 
        Manufacturing Innovation Institutes, will develop enhanced digital 
        capabilities to design and test new products and reduce costs in 
        manufacturing processes across a variety of industries;
Whereas 3D printing has widespread applications in home construction, home goods 
        production, biotechnology, the automotive sector, aerospace, medicine, 
        consumer electronics, and defense;
Whereas 3D printing has the potential to reshape manufacturing in the United 
        States, by decreasing the cost of producing goods for small businesses 
        and local manufacturers;
Whereas innovation will be increased, as 3D printing reduces the time required 
        for product development and market launch; and
Whereas December 3, 2014, would be an appropriate date to designate as the 
        ``National Day of 3D Printing'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of the ``National Day of 3D 
        Printing'';
            (2) recognizes the economic impact of 3D printing and the 
        positive implications of 3D printing for the United States 
        advanced manufacturing sector; and
            (3) encourages the promotion and celebration of 3D printing 
        technology.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
