                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the importance of acknowledging the contributions of 
               Dominican-Americans to the United States.

Whereas since the initial wave of Dominican migration in the 1960s to the most 
        recent arrivals of today, Dominicans have worked hard to contribute to 
        the national identity of the United States, educating people on their 
        culture and traditions and enriching the quality of our shared futures;
Whereas Dominican-Americans living on our shores have been motivated by the 
        value of hard work and the bonds of family, the same pillars of our 
        society that has built this great Nation for over 230 years;
Whereas contributions from Dominican-Americans can be found in every facet of 
        United States life, from the many baseball stars in our national 
        pastime, to fashion legend Oscar de la Renta, to the thousands of 
        professionals that do battle as soldiers, doctors, lawyers, journalists, 
        educators, and many other public servants;
Whereas many of our hemisphere's first institutions were established on the 
        shores of the Dominican Republic, including the first cathedral and the 
        oldest university;
Whereas Dominicans are freedom loving people who first began their campaign for 
        their independence in 1831 under the leadership of Juan Pablo Duarte, 
        who formed a secret society named The Trinity that led to a decisive 
        uprising, which resulted in independence for the Dominican Republic;
Whereas after the long and hard fought campaign for freedom, a ceremonial musket 
        shot fired on February 27, 1844, marked the Dominican Republic's first 
        official Independence Day;
Whereas it is appropriate that the United States reserve the period between 
        January 21 to February 27 to celebrate and honor Dominican heritage;
Whereas it would be befitting to celebrate Dominican heritage beginning on 
        January 21, The Day of the Procession of Altagracia, The Dominican 
        Republic's most important religious celebration;
Whereas it would also be befitting to end the period of Dominican heritage on 
        February 27, the Dominican Republic's Independence Day;
Whereas during the period between January 21 to February 27 of each year, the 
        Dominican people also celebrate Carnival, the biggest, most colorful 
        event in the Dominican Republic where participants dress in colorful 
        masks and costumes, crack whips, and dance in the street as a symbol of 
        the end of slavery and Spanish rule;
Whereas it would give us the opportunity to acknowledge and applaud the 
        economic, cultural, and social contributions Dominican-Americans have 
        made to the United States; and
Whereas it would also give us an opportunity to consider the many Dominican 
        achievements, on the island and in the United States: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the importance of acknowledging the 
        contributions of Dominican-Americans to the United States;
            (2) supports the establishment of a national month of 
        recognition for Dominican-Americans to honor the Dominican 
        people and their contributions; and
            (3) urges the President to issue a proclamation calling on 
        the people of the United States to observe a national month of 
        recognition for Dominican-Americans with appropriate 
        ceremonies, programs, and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
