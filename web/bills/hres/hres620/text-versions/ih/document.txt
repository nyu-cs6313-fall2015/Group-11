                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the 
 Government of Mexico should immediately release United States Marine 
Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi and provide for his swift return to the United 
    States so Sgt. Tahmooressi can receive the appropriate medical 
                 assistance for his medical condition.

Whereas 25-year-old United States Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi served two 
        tours of duty in Afghanistan;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi received a meritorious battle promotion to Sergeant 
        while serving in Afghanistan's Helmand province with 2nd Battalion, 6th 
        Marine Regiment;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi is a member of the Individual Ready Reserve and 
        received an ``Order to Muster'' letter on May 9 requiring him to report 
        to the 4th Civil Affairs Group on June 14;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi was arrested at the United States-Mexican border on 
        March 31, 2014;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi's vehicle included three firearms legally registered in 
        his name in the United States;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi claims to have crossed into Mexico inadvertently;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi is still being held in the El Hongo II prison in 
        Tecate, Mexico;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi alleges that abuse during the beginning of his 
        incarceration and poor prison conditions led him to attempt suicide;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder 
        (PTSD) following his service to the United States Marine Corps in 
        Afghanistan;
Whereas PTSD can result in hyper-vigilance, memory and cognition lapses, and 
        depression;
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi's reported actions of aggression, escape, and physical 
        self-abuse are likely manifestations of his PTSD; and
Whereas Sgt. Tahmooressi's immediate release would allow him to enroll in 
        medical treatment at a clinic specializing in combat-related PTSD in the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) the Government of Mexico should immediately release 
        United States Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi and provide for 
        his swift return to the United States so Sgt. Tahmooressi can 
        receive the appropriate medical assistance for his medical 
        condition; and
            (2) the President of the United States should utilize the 
        full powers and authorities of his office to immediately secure 
        the release of United States Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi.
