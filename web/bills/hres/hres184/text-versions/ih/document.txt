H. RES. 184

 Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the United 
States should immediately remove all members of the United States Armed 
Forces from Afghanistan and pursue alternative strategies, which do not 
require large deployments of ground combat forces of the Armed Forces, 
    in order to create a stable Afghanistan that is not a base for 
                        international terrorism.

Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces have fought bravely and 
        honorably for more than 11 years in Afghanistan;
Whereas more than 2,000 members of the United States Armed Forces have died in 
        Afghanistan since 2001, more than 18,400 members have been wounded, and 
        thousands of members remain in harm's way;
Whereas it is estimated that the United States has spent more than $640 billion 
        on aid and military operations in Afghanistan since 2001;
Whereas the United States has brought Osama Bin Laden to justice, which was the 
        original justification for removing the Taliban from power in 
        Afghanistan;
Whereas, despite the tremendous effort of the United States Armed Forces to 
        create a stable and secure Afghanistan, long-standing political and 
        ethnic divisions in Afghanistan that pre-date the September 11, 2001, 
        terrorist attacks remain unresolved;
Whereas the resource demands required to maintain large scale United States 
        military operations in Afghanistan have become a strategic 
        vulnerability; and
Whereas continuation of the current United States strategy for Afghanistan 
        offers no realistic prospects to create a stable and secure Afghanistan: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the United States should--
            (1) immediately remove all members of the United States 
        Armed Forces from Afghanistan; and
            (2) pursue alternative strategies, which do not require 
        large deployments of ground combat forces of the Armed Forces 
        in Afghanistan, in order to create a stable Afghanistan that is 
        not a base for international terrorism.
                                 <all>
