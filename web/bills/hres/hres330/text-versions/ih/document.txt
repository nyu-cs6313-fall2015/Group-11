                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that until the 
United States southern border is secured as confirmed by the governors 
 and the legislatures jointly of the four southern border states, the 
House of Representatives shall not bring any legislation including any 
conference report regarding immigration to the floor of the House for a 
                                 vote.

Whereas the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) expresses the sense 
        of Congress that the immigration laws of the United States should be 
        enforced vigorously and uniformly;
Whereas through increased government spending for a bigger staff and new 
        surveillance technology IRCA promised to control the borders and 
        ``prevent and deter the illegal entry of aliens in the United States and 
        the violation of the terms of their entry'';
Whereas IRCA did not include any trigger to secure the border before 
        legalization;
Whereas the employment verification system established under IRCA failed to 
        prevent the hiring of undocumented immigrants;
Whereas the Immigration and Naturalization Service and then the DHS failed to 
        properly enforce the employer sanctions laws under IRCA;
Whereas ten years after the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act was passed 
        the estimated number of undocumented aliens almost doubled, from 3.2 
        million to 5.8 million. Ten years after that, the number almost doubled 
        again, to 11.6 million;
Whereas the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Border Security, 
        Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act will result in 
        4.8 million new illegal immigrants and their U.S.-born children will be 
        living in the United States by 2023;
Whereas according to a 2010 Rasmussen poll 68 percent of likely voters think 
        that securing the border is more important than granting amnesty to 
        illegal aliens;
Whereas President Obama previously promised to secure the U.S. border with 
        Mexico;
Whereas President Obama and the Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano 
        have enacted policies outside of their Constitutional authority that 
        deliberately undermine immigration enforcement laws by instructing 
        various law enforcement agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs 
        Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol not to carry out their 
        statutory duties;
Whereas a recent GAO report found that only 129 miles of the approximate 2,000-
        mile border between the U.S. and Mexico are under ``full control''; and
Whereas the non-partisan GAO also determined that less than half of the 
        southwest border is under ``operational control'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That until the United States southern border is secured 
as confirmed by the governors and the legislatures jointly of the four 
southern border states, the House of Representatives shall not bring 
any legislation including any conference report regarding immigration 
to the floor of the House for a vote.
