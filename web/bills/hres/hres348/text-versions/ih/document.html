                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for designation of September 2013 as ``National 
                   Prostate Cancer Awareness Month''.

Whereas countless families in the United States live with prostate cancer;
Whereas 1 in 6 males in the United States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer 
        in his lifetime;
Whereas prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the 
        second most common cause of cancer-related deaths among males in the 
        United States;
Whereas in 2013, the National Cancer Institute estimates that nearly 240,000 men 
        will be diagnosed with and more than 29,000 men will die of prostate 
        cancer;
Whereas 30 percent of newly diagnosed prostate cancer cases occur in males under 
        the age of 65;
Whereas approximately every 14 seconds, a male in the United States turns 50 
        years old and increases his odds of developing cancer, including 
        prostate cancer;
Whereas African-American males suffer from a prostate cancer incidence rate that 
        is up to 65 percent higher than White males and have double the prostate 
        cancer mortality rate of White males;
Whereas obesity is a significant predictor of the severity of prostate cancer;
Whereas the probability that obesity will lead to death and high cholesterol 
        levels is strongly associated with advanced prostate cancer;
Whereas males in the United States with one family member diagnosed with 
        prostate cancer have a 33 percent chance of being diagnosed with the 
        disease, males with two close family members diagnosed have an 83 
        percent chance, and males with three family members diagnosed have a 97 
        percent chance;
Whereas screening by a digital rectal examination and a prostate-specific 
        antigen blood test can detect the disease at the early stages, including 
        the chances of survival for more than five years to nearly 100 percent;
Whereas only 33 percent of males survive more than five years if diagnosed with 
        prostate cancer after it has metastasized;
Whereas there are no noticeable symptoms of prostate cancer while it is in the 
        early stages, making screening critical;
Whereas ongoing research promises further improvements in prostate cancer 
        prevention, early detection, and treatment;
Whereas educating people in the United States, including health care providers, 
        about prostate cancer and early detection strategies is crucial to 
        saving the lives of males and preserving and protecting families; and
Whereas September 2013 would be an appropriate month to designate as ``National 
        Prostate Cancer Awareness Month'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``National Prostate Cancer 
        Awareness Month'';
            (2) declares that steps should be taken to--
                    (A) raise awareness about the importance of 
                screening methods for, and treatment of, prostate 
                cancer;
                    (B) support research so that the screening and 
                treatment of prostate cancer may be improved, and so 
                that the causes of, and a cure for, prostate cancer may 
                be discovered; and
                    (C) continue to consider ways for improving access 
                to, and the quality of, health care services for 
                detecting and treating prostate cancer; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States, interested 
        groups, and affected persons to--
                    (A) promote awareness of prostate cancer;
                    (B) take an active role in the fight to end the 
                devastating effects of prostate cancer on individuals, 
                their families, and the economy; and
                    (C) observe ``National Prostate Cancer Awareness 
                Month'' with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
