                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the goals and ideals of National Women's History Month.

Whereas the purpose of National Women's History Month is to increase awareness 
        and knowledge of women's involvement in history;
Whereas as recently as the 1970s, women's history was rarely included in the 
        kindergarten through grade 12 curriculum and was not part of public 
        awareness;
Whereas the Education Task Force of the Sonoma County (California) Commission on 
        the Status of Women initiated a ``Women's History Week'' celebration in 
        1978 centered around International Women's History Day, which is 
        celebrated on March 8;
Whereas in 1980, the National Women's History Project was founded in Sonoma 
        County, California, by Molly Murphy MacGregor, Mary Ruthsdotter, Maria 
        Cuevas, Paula Hammett, and Bette Morgan to broadcast women's historical 
        achievements;
Whereas National Women's History Project founder Mary Ruthsdotter, who passed 
        away in January 2010, was a leader in the effort to ensure the inclusion 
        of women's accomplishments in the Nation's history;
Whereas in 1981, responding to the growing popularity of women's history 
        celebrations, Congress passed a resolution making Women's History Week a 
        national observance;
Whereas during this time, using information provided by the National Women's 
        History Project, founded in Sonoma County, California, thousands of 
        schools and communities joined in the commemoration of National Women's 
        History Week, with support and encouragement from governors, city 
        councils, school boards, and Congress;
Whereas in 1987, the National Women's History Project petitioned Congress to 
        expand the national celebration to include the entire month of March;
Whereas educators, workplace program planners, parents, and community 
        organizations in thousands of communities in the United States under the 
        guidance of the National Women's History Project, have turned National 
        Women's History Month into a major local learning experience and 
        celebration;
Whereas the popularity of women's history celebrations has sparked a new 
        interest in uncovering women's forgotten heritage;
Whereas the President's Commission on the Celebration of Women in American 
        History was established to consider how best to acknowledge and 
        celebrate the roles and accomplishments of women in United States 
        history;
Whereas the National Women's History Museum was founded in 1996 as an 
        institution dedicated to preserving, interpreting, and celebrating the 
        diverse historic contributions of women, and integrating this rich 
        heritage fully into the Nation's teachings and history books;
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes March 2014 as National Women's 
        History Month; and
Whereas the theme of National Women's History Month 2014 is ``Women of 
        Character, Courage, and Commitment'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Women's 
        History Month; and
            (2) recognizes and honors the women and organizations in 
        the United States that have fought for and continue to promote 
        the teaching of women's history.
                                 <all>
