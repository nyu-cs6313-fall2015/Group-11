			 rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole
			 House on the state of the Union for consideration of the concurrent
			 resolution (H. Con. Res. 96) establishing the budget for the United States
			 Government for fiscal year 2015 and setting forth appropriate budgetary
			 levels for fiscal years 2016 through 2024. The first reading of the
			 concurrent resolution shall be dispensed with. All points of order against
			 consideration of the concurrent resolution are waived. General debate
			 shall not exceed four hours, with three hours of general debate confined
			 to the congressional budget equally divided and controlled by the chair
			 and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget and one hour of
			 general debate on the subject of economic goals and policies equally
			 divided and controlled by Representative Brady of Texas and Representative
			 Carolyn Maloney of New York or their respective designees. After general
			 debate the concurrent resolution shall be considered for amendment under
			 the five-minute rule. The concurrent resolution shall be considered as
			 read. No amendment shall be in order except those printed in the report of
			 the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each amendment may be
			 offered only in the order printed in the report, may be offered only by a
			 Member designated in the report, shall be considered as read, and shall be
			 debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and
			 controlled by the proponent and an opponent. All points of order against
			 such amendments are waived except that the adoption of an amendment in the
			 nature of a substitute shall constitute the conclusion of consideration of
			 the concurrent resolution for amendment. After the conclusion of
			 consideration of the concurrent resolution for amendment and a final
			 period of general debate, which shall not exceed 10 minutes equally
			 divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the
			 Committee on the Budget, the Committee shall rise and report the
			 concurrent resolution to the House with such amendment as may have been
			 adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the
			 concurrent resolution and amendments thereto to adoption without
			 intervening motion except amendments offered by the chair of the Committee
			 on the Budget pursuant to section 305(a)(5) of the Congressional Budget
			 Act of 1974 to achieve mathematical consistency. The concurrent resolution
			 shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question of its
			 adoption.</text>
