                               RESOLUTION


 
      Providing for consideration of the bill (H.R. 4870) making 
appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending 
     September 30, 2015, and for other purposes, and providing for 
 consideration of the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 3230) making 
 continuing appropriations during a Government shutdown to provide pay 
and allowances to members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces 
         who perform inactive-duty training during such period.

    Resolved, That (a) at any time after adoption of this resolution 
the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the 
House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of 
the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 4870) making 
appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 2015, and for other purposes. The first reading of the 
bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration 
of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill 
and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. 
After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under 
the five-minute rule. Points of order against provisions in the bill 
for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived.
     (b) During consideration of the bill for amendment--
            (1) each amendment, other than amendments provided for in 
        paragraph (2), shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally 
        divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent and 
        shall not be subject to amendment except as provided in 
        paragraph (2);
            (2) no pro forma amendment shall be in order except that 
        the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on 
        Appropriations or their respective designees may offer up to 10 
        pro forma amendments each at any point for the purpose of 
        debate; and
            (3) the chair of the Committee of the Whole may accord 
        priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member 
        offering an amendment has caused it to be printed in the 
        portion of the Congressional Record designated for that purpose 
        in clause 8 of rule XVIII. Amendments so printed shall be 
        considered as read.
    (c) When the committee rises and reports the bill back to the House 
with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the previous question 
shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit 
with or without instructions.
    Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in order to 
take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 3230) making continuing 
appropriations during a Government shutdown to provide pay and 
allowances to members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces who 
perform inactive-duty training during such period, with the Senate 
amendments thereto, and to consider in the House, without intervention 
of any point of order or question of consideration, a single motion 
offered by the chair of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs or his 
designee that the House: (1) concur in the Senate amendment to the 
title; and (2) concur in the Senate amendment to the text with the 
amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying 
this resolution. The Senate amendments and the motion shall be 
considered as read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the motion to adoption without intervening 
motion or demand for division of the question. If the motion is 
adopted, then it shall be in order for the chair of the Committee on 
Veterans' Affairs or his designee to move that the House insist on its 
amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3230 and request a conference 
with the Senate thereon.
