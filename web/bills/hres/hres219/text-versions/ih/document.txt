                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of National Asian and Pacific Islander 
                        HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.

Whereas Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders are the largest 
        growing group in the United States and constitute diverse communities 
        including over 50 different ethnic sub-groups speaking over 100 
        languages and dialects;
Whereas from 2009 to 2010 the number of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and 
        Pacific Islanders who have been diagnosed with HIV has increased at 
        least 50 percent;
Whereas analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data has 
        revealed that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were the only ethnic 
        groups with a statistically significant increase in new HIV diagnoses 
        (4.4 percent) between 2001 and 2008;
Whereas Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders have the 
        highest number of individuals who have never been tested for HIV;
Whereas 6 out of 10 Asian Americans and 7 out of 10 Native Hawaiian/Pacific 
        Islanders have never been tested for HIV;
Whereas the CDC estimates that 1 in 3 Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and 
        Pacific Islanders living with HIV/AIDS are unaware they are infected 
        with HIV;
Whereas 37 percent of HIV diagnoses among Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and 
        Pacific Islanders progressed to AIDS in less than 12 months;
Whereas the CDC estimates that over 9,000 AIDS cases have been diagnosed among 
        Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders;
Whereas significant barriers remain for accessing culturally and linguistically 
        competent services, especially HIV testing;
Whereas HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination continues to be a growing problem in 
        all communities, including the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and 
        Pacific Islander community;
Whereas HIV/AIDS stigma and discrimination increases risk-taking behavior and 
        prevents people from accessing the HIV/AIDS services and support they 
        need;
Whereas the National HIV/AIDS Strategy released in July 2010 established the 
        three primary goals of reducing HIV incidence, increasing access to 
        care, and optimizing health outcomes and reducing HIV-related health 
        disparities, including specific strategies focused on Asian American, 
        Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations, such as targeted and 
        disaggregated surveillance and stigma prevention efforts and 
        interventions targeted to the men who have sex with men community;
Whereas the development of the Minority AIDS Initiative in 1998 to coordinate 
        funding, capacity building, and prevention, care, and treatment services 
        within African-American, Hispanic, Asian American, Pacific Islander, and 
        Native American communities has assisted with the development of 
        leadership in minority community-based organizations, provided 
        culturally and linguistically competent HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and 
        treatment services, developed community capacity and infrastructure, 
        promoted technical assistance and resources, and raised awareness among 
        Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander communities; and
Whereas on May 19, 2013, community members from all ethnic groups will come 
        together in recognition of the ninth annual National Asian and Pacific 
        Islander HIV/AIDS Awareness Day: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the observance of National Asian American and 
        Pacific Islander HIV/AIDS Awareness Day in order to honor the 
        memory of the 3,542 Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and 
        Pacific Islanders with AIDS in the United States who have died, 
        as well as the estimated 9,317 Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders who are still living with HIV/AIDS;
            (2) recognizes the importance of culturally and 
        linguistically competent services as a core element in reducing 
        HIV/AIDS rates in Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific 
        Islander communities;
            (3) recognizes the importance of addressing the gaps in 
        research and data in order to fully understand the HIV/AIDS 
        epidemic in Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific 
        Islander communities; and
            (4) recognizes the people across the United States infected 
        and affected by HIV/AIDS who are commemorating this day with 
        community-wide activities and who work to reduce the impact of 
        HIV/AIDS on Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific 
        Islander communities across the United States and the United 
        States affiliated Pacific Island jurisdictions.
