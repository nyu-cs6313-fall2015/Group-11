                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the significance of Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month 
in May as an important time to celebrate the significant contributions 
   of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to the Nation's history.

Whereas the United States joins together each May to pay tribute to the 
        contributions of generations of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
        who have enriched the Nation's history;
Whereas the history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United 
        States is inextricably tied to the story of the Nation;
Whereas the Asian American and Pacific Islander community is an inherently 
        diverse population, comprised of over 45 distinct ethnicities and over 
        100 language dialects;
Whereas the United States Census Bureau found that the Asian American population 
        grew faster than any other racial or ethnic group over the last decade, 
        surging nearly 46 percent between 2000 and 2010, a growth rate 4 times 
        faster than the total United States population;
Whereas the 2010 Census estimated that there are now 17,300,000 United States 
        residents who identify as Asian, and 1,200,000 United States residents 
        who identify themselves as Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 
        making up nearly 6 percent of the total United States population;
Whereas the month of May was selected for Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month 
        due to the following two historical events, first, May 7, 1843, when the 
        first Japanese immigrants arrived in the United States, and second, May 
        10, 1869, when, with substantial contributions from Chinese immigrants, 
        the first transcontinental railroad was completed;
Whereas 2013 marks 70 years since the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act and 25 
        years since the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 which granted 
        reparations to Japanese Americans interned during World War II, both 
        cases in which the United States Congress acted to address 
        discriminatory laws that targeted those of Asian descent;
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United States Code, officially designates May 
        as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month, and requests the President to 
        issue each year a proclamation calling on the people of the United 
        States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and 
        activities;
Whereas the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a bicameral caucus of 
        Members of Congress advocating on behalf of Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders, is composed of 41 Members this year, including 13 Members of 
        Asian or Pacific Islander descent;
Whereas the 113th Congress has welcomed a number of historic firsts this year, 
        including Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, the first Asian American woman and 
        first Buddhist to ever serve in the United States Senate, Rep. Tammy 
        Duckworth, the first Thai American woman, first wounded female combat 
        Veteran, and first Asian American from Illinois to serve in Congress, 
        Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu American and first Pacific Islander 
        woman to serve in Congress, Rep. Grace Meng, the first Asian American 
        Member of Congress elected to represent the State of New York, and Rep. 
        Mark Takano, the first openly gay person of color to ever serve in 
        Congress;
Whereas today, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are serving in State 
        legislatures across the Nation, in States as diverse as Alaska, Arizona, 
        California, Connecticut, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, 
        Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, 
        and Washington;
Whereas the number of Asian American and Pacific Islander Article III judges has 
        more than doubled over the past 4 years, reflecting a commitment to 
        diversity in the Federal judiciary that has resulted in the 
        confirmations of high caliber Asian American and Pacific Islander 
        judicial nominees;
Whereas there still remains much to be done to ensure that Asian Americans and 
        Pacific Islanders have access to resources, a voice in the United States 
        Government, and continue to advance in the Nation's political landscape; 
        and
Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month provides the people of 
        the United States with an opportunity to recognize the achievements, 
        contributions, history, and address the challenges faced by Asian 
        Americans and Pacific Islanders: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the significance of Asian/Pacific American 
        Heritage Month as an important time to celebrate the 
        significant contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders to the Nation's history; and
            (2) recognizes that Asian American and Pacific Islander 
        communities enhance the rich diversity of the United States and 
        strengthen the Nation.
