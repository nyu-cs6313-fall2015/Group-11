  <summary>12/12/2013--Introduced.
Reaffirms the commitment of the House of Representatives to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability.

 Declares that Iran should: (1) dismantle all enrichment facilities and cease all centrifuge production; (2) dismantle its Arak heavy-water plutonium reactor and cease all heavy-water production efforts; (3) allow inspections and monitoring of all nuclear and weapons-testing facilities and fully implement the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; (4) cease the development, production, and testing of long-range ballistic missiles; (5) cease and dismantle the development of a nuclear warhead and cease other weaponization efforts; (6) suspend support for terrorist organizations including Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as the Assad regime in Syria; and (7) reduce human rights violations, including the persecution of religious minorities and unjust imprisonment of innocent U.S. citizens.

 Reaffirms the need for additional economic sanctions against Iran should it fail to meet the negotiated terms of the interim nuclear agreement of November 2013 within six months.</summary>
