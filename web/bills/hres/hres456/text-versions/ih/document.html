                               RESOLUTION


 
    Calling on schools and State and local educational agencies to 
 recognize that dyslexia has significant educational implications that 
                           must be addressed.

Whereas, defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading in an individual who has 
        the intelligence to be a much better reader, dyslexia reflects a 
        difficulty in getting to the individual sounds of spoken language which 
        typically impacts speaking, reading, spelling, and often, learning a 
        second language;
Whereas dyslexia is highly prevalent, affecting one out of five individuals in 
        some form, and is persistent;
Whereas dyslexia is a paradox, so that often the same individual who has a 
        weakness in decoding or reading fluency also has strengths in higher 
        level cognitive functions such as reasoning, critical thinking, concept 
        formation, and problem solving;
Whereas great progress has been made in understanding dyslexia at a scientific 
        level, including its epidemiology, and cognitive and neurobiological 
        bases; and
Whereas diagnosis of dyslexia is critical, and must lead to focused, evidence-
        based interventions, necessary accommodations, self-awareness, self-
        empowerment, and school and life success: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives calls on schools and 
State and local educational agencies to recognize that dyslexia has 
significant educational implications that must be addressed.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
