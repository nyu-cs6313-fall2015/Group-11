                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of March 13 as ``K-9 Veterans 
 Day'', in order to recognize the service and improve the treatment of 
                         military working dogs.

Whereas, on March 13, 1942, the Quartermaster Corps of the United States Army 
        began training dogs for a newly established War Dog Program, or K-9 
        Corps;
Whereas military working dogs and their handlers have served the United States 
        since World War I in roles such as sentry duty, search and rescue, 
        detection of explosives and narcotics, border protection, and other 
        military and law enforcement duties;
Whereas, in 1921, General John Pershing awarded a gold medal to ``Sgt. Stubby'', 
        a military working dog, and the dog visited the White House in 1921 to 
        meet President Harding and in 1924 to meet President Coolidge;
Whereas ``Chips'', a German Shepherd-Collie-Siberian Husky who valiantly served 
        with the Third Infantry Division during World War II, was awarded the 
        Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, and Purple Heart for taking 
        actions that saved lives in his unit;
Whereas ``Chips''' awards were revoked due to Army policy;
Whereas over 10,000 military working dogs were trained at War Dog Centers during 
        World War II;
Whereas Federal, State, and municipal law enforcement agencies utilize working 
        dogs to achieve their missions and protect our communities;
Whereas K-9 veterans have saved countless lives at home and abroad in service to 
        United States military and law enforcement agencies;
Whereas, today, over 2,300 military working dogs are deployed worldwide in 
        support of the Global War on Terrorism;
Whereas the United States has increasingly relied on military working dogs due 
        to their unique skills and capabilities; and
Whereas retired military working dogs have successfully transitioned to roles as 
        pets and therapy dogs: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``K-9 Veterans Day''; and
            (2) supports efforts to recognize the service of military 
        working dogs and their handlers.
