        paragraph (2)''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(2) A foreign country described in this paragraph is--
            ``(A) a nation with which there is in effect a free trade 
        agreement requiring national treatment for trade in natural

    ``(3) The exportation of natural gas to Japan shall be deemed to be 
consistent with the public interest pursuant to paragraph (1), and

the United States and Japan, remains in effect.''.
