    (c) Directive to the Sentencing Commission.--Pursuant to its 
authority under section 994 of title 28, United States Code, and in 
accordance with this section, the United States Sentencing Commission 
shall review and amend its guidelines and policy statements to ensure 
that persons convicted of an offense under section 932 or 933 of title 
18, United States Code, and other offenses applicable to the straw 
purchases and firearms trafficking of firearms are subject to increased 
penalties in comparison to those currently provided by the guidelines 
and policy statements for such straw purchasing and firearms 
trafficking offenses. In its review, the Commission shall consider, in 
particular, an appropriate amendment to reflect the intent of Congress 
that straw purchasers without significant criminal histories receive 
sentences that are sufficient to deter participation in such 
activities. The Commission shall also review and amend its guidelines 
and policy statements to reflect the intent of Congress that a person 
convicted of an offense under section 932 or 933 of title 18, United 
States Code, who is affiliated with a gang, cartel, organized crime 
ring, or other such enterprise should be subject to higher penalties 
than an otherwise unaffiliated individual.

    Section 924(a)(1) of title 18, United States Code, is amended in 
the undesignated matter following subparagraph (D) by striking ``five 
years'' and inserting the following: ``5 years (or, in the case of a 
violation under subparagraph (A), not more than 10 years)''.
