                situation requires the production of tangible things 
                before an order authorizing such production can with 
                due diligence be obtained;

        production of tangible things under paragraph (1), the Attorney 
        General shall require that the minimization procedures required 
        by this section for the issuance of a judicial order be 
        followed.

        after the expiration of 7 days from the time the Attorney 
        General begins requiring the emergency production of such 
        tangible things, whichever is earliest.

        subsection may be reviewed as provided in section 103.

        other case where the production of tangible things is 
        terminated and no order is issued approving the production, no 
        information obtained or evidence derived from such production

        concerning any United States person acquired from such 
        production shall subsequently be used or disclosed in any other 
        manner by Federal officers or employees without the consent of 
        such person, except with the approval of the Attorney General 
        if the information indicates a threat of death or serious 
        bodily harm to any person.

        requirements of paragraph (5).''.
