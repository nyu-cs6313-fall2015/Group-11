  <summary>5/22/2014--Introduced.
Work and Learn Act - Amends the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to require a local workforce investment board to include a representative with expertise implementing work-based programs of employment and training activities that combine technical training with related instruction, including programs that begin by providing mentoring and job shadowing opportunities, which evolve into intensive internships and registered apprenticeships.

Revises requirements for a comprehensive performance accountability system assessing the effectiveness of states and local areas in achieving continuous improvement of workforce investment activities. Adds completion of a registered apprenticeship to the core indicators of performance for authorized employment and training activities (except for self-service and informational activities) and youth activities for eligible individuals age 19 through 21.</summary>
