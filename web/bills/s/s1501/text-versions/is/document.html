                                 A BILL


 
To establish a Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing Program in the 
Department of Energy to provide financial assistance to promote energy 
   efficiency and onsite renewable technologies in manufacturing and 
                         industrial facilities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Job Creation through Energy 
Efficient Manufacturing Act''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to encourage widespread deployment of 
energy efficiency and onsite renewable energy technologies in 
manufacturing and industrial facilities throughout the United States 
through the establishment of a Financing Energy Efficient Manufacturing 
Program that would--
            (1) encourage the widespread availability of financial 
        products and programs with attractive rates and terms that 
        significantly reduce or eliminate upfront expenses to allow 
        manufacturing and industrial businesses to invest in energy 
        efficiency measures, onsite clean and renewable energy systems, 
        smart grid systems, and alternative vehicle fleets by providing 
        credit support, credit enhancement, secondary markets, and 
        other support to originators of the financial products and 
        sponsors of the financing programs; and
            (2) help building owners to invest in measures and systems 
        that reduce energy costs, in many cases creating a net cost 
        savings that can be realized in the short-term, and may also 
        allow manufacturing and industrial businesses owners to defer 
        capital expenditures, save money to hire new workers, and 
        increase the value, comfort, and sustainability of the property 
        of the owners.

            (1) Covered program.--The term ``covered program'' means a
