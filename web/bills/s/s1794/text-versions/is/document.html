        cultural, recreational, natural, wilderness, historic, scenic,

        camping;
            (3) permanently protecting the values described in

        depend on the area; and
            (4) designating the Browns Canyon National Monument and the 
        Browns Canyon Wilderness would maintain and protect the world

        within the National Monument that is not designated as 
        wilderness;
