To ensure that the Federal Aviation Administration advances the safety 
    of small airplanes and the continued development of the general 
               aviation industry, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Small Airplane 
Revitalization Act of 2013''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    Congress makes the following findings:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) A healthy small aircraft industry is integral 
        to economic growth and to maintaining an effective 
        transportation infrastructure for communities and countries 
        around the world.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) Small airplanes comprise nearly 90 percent of 
        general aviation aircraft certified by the Federal Aviation 
        Administration.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) General aviation provides for the cultivation 
        of a workforce of engineers, manufacturing and maintenance 
        professionals, and pilots who secure the economic success and 
        defense of the United States.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) General aviation contributes to well-paying 
        jobs in the manufacturing and technology sectors in the United 
        States and products produced by those sectors are exported in 
        great numbers.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) Technology developed and proven in general 
        aviation aids in the success and safety of all sectors of 
        aviation and scientific competence.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) The average small airplane in the United 
        States is now 40 years old and the regulatory barriers to 
        bringing new designs to the market are resulting in a lack of 
        innovation and investment in small airplane design.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) Since 2003, the United States lost 10,000 
        active private pilots per year on average, partially due to a 
        lack of cost-effective, new small airplanes.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) General aviation safety can be improved by 
        modernizing and revamping the regulations relating to small 
        airplanes to clear the path for technology adoption and cost-
        effective means to retrofit the existing fleet with new safety 
        technologies.</DELETED>

              AVIATION.</DELETED>

        safety objectives that will spur innovation and technology 
        adoption.</DELETED>

        requirements under part 23 with performance-based 
        regulations.</DELETED>
