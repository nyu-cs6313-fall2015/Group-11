 Mr. Kaine (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. Baucus) introduced the

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To ensure that the education and training provided members of the Armed 
 Forces and veterans better assists members and veterans in obtaining 
     civilian certifications and licenses, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Troop Talent Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 
        unemployment rate for recent veterans of military operations in 
        Iraq and Afghanistan was 9.4 percent in February 2013, compared 
        with 7.6 percent in February 2012.
            (2) With the unemployment rate among such veterans higher 
        than the national average and the number of veterans receiving 
        unemployment benefits doubling since 2002, there is a 
        significant need to assist members of the Armed Forces as they 
        transition to the civilian workforce.
            (3) In order to remain competitive in the civilian 
        employment market, members of the Armed Forces and veterans 
        require information about how their military skill sets 
        translate to the requirements of the civilian workforce. 
        Members of the Armed Forces currently receive insufficient or 
        inadequate information during their training for military 
        occupational specialties on translating skills obtained during 
        such training to civilian occupations and credentials.
            (4) In addition, there is a need for enhanced access by 
        accredited credentialing agencies to military training 
        curricula in order to facilitate and enhance the correlation 
        between military training and applicable civilian credentialing 
        courses and exams.
            (5) The information technology sector is one of the fastest 
        growing industries, with tremendous job growth and demand for 
        talented, qualified individuals. The information technology 
        sector has an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent according to a 
        Bureau of Labor Statistics report from February 2013.
            (6) The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a need for 
        110,000 computer support specialists over the next decade. 
        Currently, the size of the information technology workforce in 
        the Armed Forces is about 160,000 members.

SEC. 3. ENHANCEMENT OF MECHANISMS TO CORRELATE SKILLS AND TRAINING FOR 
              MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES WITH SKILLS AND 
              TRAINING REQUIRED FOR CIVILIAN CERTIFICATIONS AND 
              LICENSES.

    (a) Improvement of Information Available to Members of the Armed 
Forces About Correlation.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretaries of the military 
        departments, in coordination with the Under Secretary of 
        Defense for Personnel and Readiness, shall, to the maximum 
        extent practicable, make information on civilian credentialing 
        opportunities available to members of the Armed Forces 
        beginning with, and at every stage of, training of members for 
        military occupational specialties, in order to permit members--
                    (A) to evaluate the extent to which such training 
                correlates with the skills and training required in 
                connection with various civilian certifications and 
                licenses; and
                    (B) to assess the suitability of such training for 
                obtaining or pursuing such civilian certifications and 
                licenses.
            (2) Coordination with transition goals plans success 
        program.--Information shall be made available under paragraph 
        (1) in a manner consistent with the Transition Goals Plans 
        Success (GPS) program.
            (3) Types of information.--The information made available 
        under paragraph (1) shall include, but not be limited to, the 
        following:

                equivalents of military occupational specialties (MOS).
                    (B) Information on civilian license or 
                certification requirements, including examination 
                requirements.
                    (C) Information on the availability and 
                opportunities for use of educational benefits available 
                to members of the Armed Forces, as appropriate, 
                corresponding training, or continuing education that 
                leads to a certification exam in order to provide a 
                pathway to credentialing opportunities.
            (4) Use and adaptation of certain programs.--In making 
        information available under paragraph (1), the Secretaries of 
        the military departments may use and adapt appropriate portions 
        of the Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL) programs of 
        the Army and the Navy and the Credentialing and Educational 
        Research Tool (CERT) of the Air Force.
    (b) Improvement of Access of Accredited Civilian Credentialing 
Agencies to Military Training Content.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretaries of the military 
        departments, in coordination with the Under Secretary of 
        Defense for Personnel and Readiness, shall, to the maximum

        requirements, make available to accredited civilian 
        credentialing agencies that issue certifications or licenses, 
        upon request of such agencies, information such as military 
        course training curricula, syllabi, and materials, levels of 
        military advancement attained, and professional skills 
        developed.
            (2) Central repository.--The actions taken pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) may include the establishment of a central 
        repository of information on training and training materials 
        provided members in connection with military occupational 
        specialties that is readily accessible by accredited civilian 
        credentialing agencies described in that paragraph in order to 
        meet requests described in that paragraph.
