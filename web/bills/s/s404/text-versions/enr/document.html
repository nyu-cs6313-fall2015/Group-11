State Wilderness Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-339; 98 Stat. 300; 16 
U.S.C. 1131 note) is amended by striking the period at the end and 
inserting the following: ``, and except that with respect to the lands 
described in section 3(5), the designation of such lands as a 
wilderness area shall not preclude the operation and maintenance of 
Green Mountain Lookout.''

individuals on or around Green Mountain. If the Secretary makes such a 
determination, the Secretary shall move the Green Mountain Lookout to a
