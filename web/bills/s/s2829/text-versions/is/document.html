amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(16) Review of regulations.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Before issuing a final 
                regulation or order the Commission shall, as part of 
                such regulation or order, assess other Federal 
                regulations and orders to determine the interaction 
                between the proposed regulation or order and other 
                Federal regulations and orders.
                    ``(B) Considerations.--In making a determination of 
                the interaction between the proposed regulation or 
                order and other Federal regulations, the Commission 
                shall evaluate the following:
                            ``(i) Whether the proposed regulation or 
                        order is in conflict with other Federal 
                        regulations or orders.
                            ``(ii) Whether the proposed regulation or 
                        order is inconsistent with other Federal 
                        regulations or orders.
                            ``(iii) Whether the proposed regulation or 
                        order is duplicative of other Federal 
                        regulations or orders.
                            ``(iv) Whether other Federal regulations or 
                        orders are outdated.
                    ``(C) Resolving duplicative or inconsistent 
                regulations or orders.--The Commission shall use its 
                best efforts through all available measures under 
                current law to reconcile any duplicative or 
                inconsistent existing regulation or order with any 
                proposed regulation or order before issuing a final 
                regulation or order.
                    ``(D) Report to congress.--Not later than the end 
                of the 60-day period beginning on the date the 
                Commission makes a determination under subparagraph 
                (B), the Commission shall issue a report to the 
                Congress containing recommendations made by the 
                Commission, including--

                        amended; and
                            ``(ii) any duplicative, inconsistent, or 
                        conflicting regulation or order of another 
                        Federal financial regulator (as defined under

                noncompliance with the requirements of this paragraph.
                    ``(F) Regulation and order defined.--For purposes 
                of this paragraph, the term `regulation' shall have the
