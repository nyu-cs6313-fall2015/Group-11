     To direct the Secretary of Defense to provide certain TRICARE 
 beneficiaries with the opportunity to retain access to TRICARE Prime.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FUTURE AVAILABILITY OF TRICARE PRIME FOR CERTAIN 
              BENEFICIARIES ENROLLED IN TRICARE PRIME.

    Section 732 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2013 (Public Law 112-239; 126 Stat. 1816) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new 
        subsection (b):
    ``(b) Access to TRICARE Prime.--
            ``(1) One-time election.--Subject to paragraph (3), the 
        Secretary shall ensure that each affected eligible beneficiary 
        who is enrolled in TRICARE Prime as of September 30, 2013, may 
        make a one-time election to continue such enrollment in TRICARE 
        Prime, notwithstanding that a contract described in subsection 
        (a)(2)(A) does not allow for such enrollment based on the 
        location in which such beneficiary resides. The beneficiary may 
        continue such enrollment in TRICARE Prime so long as the 
        beneficiary resides in the same ZIP code as the ZIP code in 
        which the beneficiary resided at the time of such election.
            ``(2) Enrollment in tricare standard.--If an affected 
        eligible beneficiary makes the one-time election under 
        paragraph (1), the beneficiary may thereafter elect to enroll 
        in TRICARE Standard at any time in accordance with a contract 
        described in subsection (a)(2)(A).
            ``(3) Residence at time of election.--An affected eligible 
        beneficiary may not make the one-time election under paragraph 
        (1) if, at the time of such election, the beneficiary does not 
        reside in a ZIP code that is in a region described in 
        subsection (c)(1)(B).''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
