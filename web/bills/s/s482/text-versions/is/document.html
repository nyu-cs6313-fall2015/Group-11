                      increases in premium rates.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Health Insurance Rate Review Act''.

SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS FROM EXCESSIVE, UNJUSTIFIED, OR 
              UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY RATES.

    (a) Protection From Excessive, Unjustified, or Unfairly 
Discriminatory Rates.--The first section 2794 of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-94), as added by section 1003 of the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(e) Protection From Excessive, Unjustified, or Unfairly 
Discriminatory Rates.--
            ``(1) Authority of states.--Nothing in this section shall 
        be construed to prohibit a State from imposing requirements 
        (including requirements relating to rate review standards and 
        procedures and information reporting) on health insurance 
        issuers with respect to rates that are in addition to the 
        requirements of this section and are more protective of 
        consumers than such requirements.
            ``(2) Consultation in rate review process.--In carrying out 
        this section, the Secretary shall consult with the National 
        Association of Insurance Commissioners and consumer groups.
            ``(3) Determination of who conducts reviews for each 
        state.--The Secretary shall determine, after the date of 
        enactment of this section and periodically thereafter, the 
        following:
                    ``(A) In which markets in each State the State 
                insurance commissioner or relevant State regulator 
                shall undertake the corrective actions under paragraph 
                (4), as a condition of the State receiving the grant in 
                subsection (c), based on the Secretary's determination 
                that the State regulator is adequately undertaking and 
                utilizing such actions in that market.
                    ``(B) In which markets in each State the Secretary 
                shall undertake the corrective actions under paragraph 
                (4), in cooperation with the relevant State insurance 
                commissioner or State regulator, based on the 
                Secretary's determination that the State is not 
                adequately undertaking and utilizing such actions in 
                that market.
            ``(4) Corrective action for excessive, unjustified, or 
        unfairly discriminatory rates.--In accordance with the process 
        established under this section, the Secretary or the relevant 
        State insurance commissioner or State regulator shall take 
        corrective actions to ensure that any excessive, unjustified, 
        or unfairly discriminatory rates are corrected prior to 
        implementation, or as soon as possible thereafter, through 
        mechanisms such as--
                    ``(A) denying rates;
                    ``(B) modifying rates; or
                    ``(C) requiring rebates to consumers.
            ``(5) Noncompliance.--Failure to comply with any corrective 
        action taken by the Secretary under this subsection may result 
        in the application of civil monetary penalties and, if the 
        Secretary determines appropriate, make the plan involved 
        ineligible for classification as a Qualified Health Plan.''.
    (b) Clarification of Regulatory Authority.--Such section is further 
amended--
