                                 A BILL


 
  To prevent human health threats posed by the consumption of equines 
                      raised in the United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Safeguard American Food Exports Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) unlike cows, pigs, and other domesticated species, 
        horses and other members of the equidae family are not raised 
        for the purpose of human consumption;
            (2) equines raised in the United States are frequently 
        treated with substances that are not approved for use in horses 
        intended for human consumption and equine parts are therefore 
        unsafe within the meaning of section 409 of the Federal Food, 
        Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
            (3) equines raised in the United States are frequently 
        treated with drugs, including phenylbutazone, acepromazine, 
        boldenone undecylenate, omeprazole, ketoprofen, xylazine, 
        hyaluronic acid, nitrofurazone, polysulfated glycosaminoglycan, 
        clenbuterol, tolazoline, and ponazuril, which are not approved 
        for use in horses intended for human consumption and equine 
        parts are therefore unsafe within the meaning of section 512 of 
        the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and
            (4) consuming parts of an equine raised in the United 
        States likely poses a serious threat to human health and the 
        public should be protected from these unsafe products.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITIONS.

    Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
331) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(ccc) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section--
            ``(1) equine parts shall be deemed unsafe under section 409 
        of this Act;
            ``(2) equine parts shall be deemed unsafe under section 512 
        of this Act; and
            ``(3) the knowing sale or transport of equines or equine 
        parts in interstate or foreign commerce for purposes of human 
        consumption is hereby prohibited.''.
                                 <all>
