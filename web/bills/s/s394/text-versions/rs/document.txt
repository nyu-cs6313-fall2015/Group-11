                injury to another person, or death;
            (3) account for any additional aggravating or mitigating 
        circumstances that may justify exceptions to the generally 
        applicable sentencing ranges;
            (4) assure reasonable consistency with other relevant 
        directives and with other sentencing guidelines and policy 
        statements; and
