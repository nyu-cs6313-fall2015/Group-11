SEC. 2. COURT-APPOINTED GUARDIANSHIP OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES UNDER THE 
              ELDER JUSTICE ACT OF 2009.

    Section 2042(c) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397m-1(c)) 
is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``(and, in the case of 
        demonstration programs described in paragraph (2)(E), to the 
        highest courts of States)'' after ``States'';
            (2) in paragraph (2)--
                    (A) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by 
                inserting ``(and the highest courts of States, in the 
                case of demonstration programs described in 
                subparagraph (E))'' after ``local units of 
                government'';
                    (B) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``or'' after 
                the semicolon;
                    (C) by redesignating subparagraph (E) as 
                subparagraph (F); and
                    (D) by inserting after subparagraph (E), the 
                following new subparagraph:
                    ``(E) subject to paragraph (3), programs to assess 
                the fairness, effectiveness, timeliness, safety, 
                integrity, and accessibility of adult guardianship and 
                conservatorship proceedings, including the appointment 
                and the monitoring of the performance of court-
                appointed guardians and conservators, and to implement 
                changes deemed necessary as a result of the assessments 
                such as mandating background checks for all potential 
                guardians and conservators, and implementing systems to 
                enable the annual accountings and other required 
                conservatorship and guardianship filings to be 
                completed, filed, and reviewed electronically in order 
                to simplify the filing process for conservators and 
                guardians and better enable courts to identify 
                discrepancies and detect fraud and the exploitation of 
                protected persons; or'';
            (3) by redesignating paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) as 
        paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), respectively;

                awarded a grant to conduct a demonstration program 
                described in paragraph (2)(E) shall collaborate with 
                the State Unit on Aging for the State and the Adult 
                Protective Services agency for the State in conducting 
                the demonstration program.'';
            (5) in paragraph (4) (as redesignated by paragraph (3) of 
        this section), by inserting ``(and, in the case of 
        demonstration programs described in paragraph (2)(E), the 
        highest court of a State)'' after ``a State''; and
            (6) in paragraph (5) (as so redesignated), by inserting 
        ``(or, in the case of demonstration programs described in 
        paragraph (2)(E), the highest court of a State)'' after
