  <summary>12/19/2013--Reported to Senate amended.
Court-Appointed Guardian Accountability and Senior Protection Act - Amends title XX (Block Grants to States for Social Services and Elder Justice) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award grants to the highest courts of states to conduct demonstration programs that: (1) assess adult guardianship and conservatorship proceedings, including the appointment and the monitoring of the performance of court-appointed guardians and conservators; and (2) implement changes deemed necessary as a result of the assessments, such as requiring background checks for all potential guardians and conservators, and establishing systems that enable electronic filing and review of the annual accountings and other required conservatorship and guardianship filings.

Requires any grants the Secretary awards to the highest state courts for such programs to be based on recommendations of the Attorney General and the State Justice Institute.

Requires the highest court of a state awarded such a grant to collaborate with the state's own Unit on Aging and its Adult Protective Services agency in conducting the demonstration program.</summary>
