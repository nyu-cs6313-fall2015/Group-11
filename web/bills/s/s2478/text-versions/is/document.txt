                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize the Secretary of Transportation to partner with industry 
to strengthen the safety culture and safety practices of short line and 
                      regional freight railroads.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Short Line Railroad Safety 
Enhancement Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The use of new oil recovery techniques, particularly in 
        regions without a sufficient number of developed pipeline 
        networks, has led to rapid growth in the transportation of 
        crude oil by rail.
            (2) Recent accidents in North America involving trains 
        carrying crude oil, such as the July 2013 tragedy in Lac-
        Megantic, Quebec, have brought the need for enhanced safety 
        into focus.
            (3) Short line and regional railroads have workforces and 
        resources that are much smaller than large Class I railroads, 
        but these railroads are expected to handle the same commodities 
        safely.
            (4) Cooperative safety reviews, assessments, and training 
        approaches can enhance safety by fostering an enhanced safety 
        culture. Cooperation between industry and the Federal Railroad 
        Administration's Research and Development Program would enhance 
        rail safety with respect to the transportation of crude oil by 
        rail and in all other areas of rail transportation.
