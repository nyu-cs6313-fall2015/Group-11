SEC. 3. REQUIRED REGULATORY ANALYSIS.

    (a) Requirements for Notices of Proposed Rulemaking.--An agency may 
not issue a notice of proposed rulemaking unless the agency includes in 
the notice of proposed rulemaking an analysis that contains, at a 
minimum, with respect to each regulation that is being proposed--
            (1) an identification of the need for the regulation and 
        the regulatory objective, including identification of the 
        nature and significance of the market failure, regulatory 
        failure, or other problem that necessitates the regulation;
            (2) an explanation of why the private market or State, 
        local, or tribal authorities cannot adequately address the 
        identified market failure or other problem;
            (3) an analysis of the adverse impacts to regulated 
        entities, other market participants, economic activity, or 
        agency effectiveness that are engendered by the regulation and 
        the magnitude of such adverse impacts;
            (4) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of all 
        anticipated direct and indirect costs and benefits of the 
        regulation (as compared to a benchmark that assumes the absence 
        of the regulation), including--
                    (A) compliance costs;
                    (B) effects on economic activity, net job creation 
                (excluding jobs related to ensuring compliance with the 
                regulation), efficiency, competition, and capital 
                formation;
                    (C) regulatory administrative costs; and
                    (D) costs imposed by the regulation on State, 
                local, or tribal governments or other regulatory 
                authorities;
            (5) if quantified benefits do not outweigh quantitative 
        costs, a justification for the regulation;
            (6) identification and assessment of all available 
        alternatives to the regulation, including modification of an 
        existing regulation or statute, together with--
                    (A) an explanation of why the regulation meets the 
                objectives of the regulation more effectively than the 
                alternatives, and if the agency is proposing multiple 
                alternatives, an explanation of why a notice of 
                proposed rulemaking, rather than an advanced notice of 
                proposed rulemaking, is appropriate; and
                    (B) if the regulation is not a pilot program, an 
                explanation of why a pilot program is not appropriate;
            (7) if the regulation specifies the behavior or manner of 
        compliance, an explanation of why the agency did not instead 
        specify performance objectives;
            (8) an assessment of how the burden imposed by the 
        regulation will be distributed among market participants, 
        including whether consumers, investors, or small businesses 
        will be disproportionately burdened;
            (9) an assessment of the extent to which the regulation is 
        inconsistent, incompatible, or duplicative with the existing 
        regulations of the agency or those of other domestic and 
        international regulatory authorities with overlapping 
        jurisdiction;
            (10) a description of any studies, surveys, or other data 
        relied upon in preparing the analysis;
            (11) an assessment of the degree to which the key 
        assumptions underlying the analysis are subject to uncertainty; 
        and
            (12) an explanation of predicted changes in market 
        structure and infrastructure and in behavior by market 
        participants, including consumers and investors, assuming that 
        they will pursue their economic interests.
    (b) Requirements for Notices of Final Rulemaking.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, an agency may not issue a notice of final rulemaking with

            (2) Consideration of comments.--The agency shall 
        incorporate in the elements described in paragraph (1)(B) the 
        data and analyses provided to the agency by commenters during 
        the comment period, or explain why the data or analyses are not 
        being incorporated.
            (3) Comment period.--An agency shall not publish a notice 
        of final rulemaking with respect to a regulation, unless the

            (4) Prohibited rules.--
                    (A) In general.--An agency may not publish a notice 
                of final rulemaking if the agency, in its analysis 
                under paragraph (1)(B), determines that the quantified 
                costs are greater than the quantified benefits under 
                subsection (a)(5).
                    (B) Publication of analysis.--If the agency is 
                precluded by subparagraph (A) from publishing a notice
