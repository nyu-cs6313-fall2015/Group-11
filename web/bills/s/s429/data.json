(Sec. 6) Requires any such order to require assessments to be paid by manufacturers with respect to concrete manufactured and marketed in the United States.\n\nEstablishes an initial assessment rate at $0.01 per concrete masonry unit sold. Grants the Board authority to increase or decrease such rate but limits the change to $0.01 per such unit. Prohibits the rate from exceeding $0.05 per unit and from being changed more than once annually.\n\nAuthorizes the Board to make specified investments of collected assessments.\n\nRequires at least 50% of the assessments (less administrative expenses) paid by a manufacturer to be used to support research, education, and promotion plans and projects in support of the geographic region of the manufacturer.\n\n(Sec. 7) Directs the Secretary, during the 60-day period preceding the proposed effective date of an order, to conduct a referendum for order approval, according to specified procedures, among the manufacturers required to pay assessments under it.\n\n(Sec. 8) Prescribes requirements for petition and review of an order, including order enforcement through U.S. district courts. Authorizes the Secretary to assess a civil penalty on any person willfully violating such an order or regulation.\n\n(Sec. 10) Authorizes the Secretary to conduct appropriate investigations to administer this Act (with power of subpoena).\n\n(Sec. 11) Directs the Secretary to suspend or terminate any order or provision of an order that obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the purposes of this Act, or that is not favored by persons voting in a referendum.\n\n(Sec. 16) Prohibits the use of funds appropriated to carry out this Act for the Board's payment of expenses or expenditures in administering the order."
