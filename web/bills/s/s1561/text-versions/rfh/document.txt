                                 AN ACT


 
 To amend the Public Health Service Act to improve provisions relating 
            to the sanctuary system for surplus chimpanzees.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``CHIMP Act Amendments of 2013''.

SEC. 2. SANCTUARY SYSTEM FOR SURPLUS CHIMPANZEES.

    (a) In General.--Section 404K(g) of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 283m(g)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) by striking ``and each subsequent fiscal year'' 
                and inserting ``through fiscal year 2023'';
                    (B) by inserting after ``$30,000,000'' the 
                following: ``, unless the Secretary determines that 
                reserving additional funds would enable the National 
                Institutes of Health to operate more efficiently and 
                economically by decreasing the overall Federal cost of 
                supporting and maintaining chimpanzees from fiscal year 
                2014 through fiscal year 2023. Such a determination 
                shall be reported to Congress by the Secretary and 
                shall include a report, to be updated biennially, 
                regarding the care and maintenance of the chimpanzees 
                and costs related to such care and maintenance''; and
                    (C) by striking the last sentence; and
            (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``board of directors'' 
        and inserting ``Secretary, in consultation with the board of 
        directors''.
    (b) GAO Study.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct 
an independent evaluation, and submit to the appropriate committees of 
Congress a report, regarding chimpanzees owned or supported by the 
National Institutes of Health. Such report shall review and assess--
            (1) the research status of National Institutes of Health-
        owned or supported chimpanzees;
            (2) the cost for the care and maintenance of such 
        chimpanzees, including the cost broken down by research or 
        retirement status, location and for transportation, as 
        appropriate;
            (3) the extent to which matching requirements have been met 
        pursuant to section 404K(e)(4) of the Public Health Service 
        Act; and
            (4) any options for cost-savings for the support and 
        maintenance of such chimpanzees that may be identified.

            Passed the Senate October 30, 2013.

            Attest:

                                                NANCY ERICKSON,

                                                             Secretary.
