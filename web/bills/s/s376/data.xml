  <summary>2/3/2014--Passed Senate amended.
Drought Information Act of 2013 - Amends the National Integrated Drought Information System Act of 2006 to specify that: (1) the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere shall continue to support the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) Program, and (2) the program's purpose shall be to better inform and provide for more timely decisionmaking to reduce drought related impacts and costs.

 Revises NIDIS functions to require the NIDIS to, among other things: (1) provide certain information (including concerning water supplies and soil moisture), forecasts, and assessments described in the Act on both national and regional levels; and (2) continue ongoing research and monitoring activities related to drought and the role of extreme weather events and climate variability in drought.

Requires the Under Secretary to provide a report to Congress concerning the NIDIS Program that includes a list of partners with whom the Under Secretary collaborates on NIDIS implementation and a description of NIDIS outreach activities.

Authorizes appropriations to carry out the Act through FY2018.</summary>
