        that an employee of the agency has engaged in covered 
        misconduct, the employee shall be found unfit for Federal 
        employment.
            (2) Fitness determinations.--An agency shall make a 
        determination under paragraph (1) in accordance with any 
        statutory, regulatory, or internal agency procedures applicable 
        to investigating alleged misconduct by employees of the agency.
            (3) Prohibition on reemployment to conduct background 
        investigations.--If an agency determines under paragraph (1) 
        that an individual is unfit for Federal employment, the 
        individual shall not be appointed to or continue to occupy a 
        position, as an employee of any agency, that requires its 
        occupant to perform background investigations.
    (b) Misconduct by Employees Under Contract.--
            (1) Ineligibility for performance of work under a covered 
        contract.--If an appropriate agency, prime contractor, or 
        subcontractor determines that an individual performing work 
        under a covered contract has engaged in covered misconduct, the 
        individual shall be ineligible to perform background 
        investigations under a covered contract.
            (2) Mandatory disclosure.--A covered contract shall include 
        a provision requiring a prime contractor or subcontractor to 
        disclose to each appropriate agency any allegation of covered 
        misconduct by an employee of the prime contractor or 
        subcontractor not later than 24 hours after the prime 
        contractor or subcontractor discovers the alleged covered 
        misconduct.
            (3) Investigation of covered misconduct.--
                    (A) Contractor investigation.--A covered contract 
                shall include a provision requiring that, not later 
                than 5 business days after the date on which a prime 
                contractor or subcontractor discloses an allegation 
                under paragraph (2), the prime contractor or 
                subcontractor shall refer the allegation of covered 
                misconduct to the agency for investigation.
                    (B) Agency investigation.--Nothing in subparagraph 
                (A) shall be construed to prohibit an appropriate 
                agency from conducting its own investigation into an 
                allegation of covered misconduct.
            (4) Prohibition on reemployment to conduct background 
        investigations.--If an appropriate agency determines, based on 
        an investigation conducted under paragraph (3), that an 
        individual is ineligible to perform work under a covered 
        contract under paragraph (1), the individual shall be 
        prohibited from performing background investigations under any 
        covered contract.

                contract under subsection (b); and
            (2) details of the covered misconduct that resulted in each 
        determination described in paragraph (1).

    (a) Guidelines.--
            (1) Initial review and update of guidance.--Not later than
