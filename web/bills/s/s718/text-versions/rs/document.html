                                 A BILL


 
To create jobs in the United States by increasing United States exports 
to Africa by at least 200 percent in real dollar value within 10 years, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing American Jobs 
Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2013''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Export growth helps United States businesses 
        grow and create American jobs. In 2011, United States exports 
        supported 9,700,000 jobs and 97.8 percent of United States 
        exports came from small- and medium-sized businesses in 
        2010.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) The more than 20 Federal agencies that are 
        involved in export promotion and financing are not sufficiently 
        coordinated to adequately expand United States commercial 
        exports to Africa.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) The President has taken steps to improve how 
        the United States Government supports American businesses by 
        mandating an executive review across agencies and a new Doing 
        Business in Africa initiative, but a substantially greater 
        high-level focus on Africa is needed.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Many other countries have trade promotion 
        programs that aggressively compete against United States 
        exports in Africa and around the world. For example, in 2010, 
        medium- and long-term official export credit general volumes 
        from the Group of 7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
        Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) totaled 
        $65,400,000,000. Germany provided the largest level of support 
        at $22,500,000,000, followed by France at $17,400,000,000 and 
        the United States at $13,000,000,000. Official export credit 
        support by emerging market economies such as Brazil, China, and 
        India are significant as well.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) Between 2008 and 2010, China alone provided 
        more than $110,000,000,000 in loans to the developing world, 
        and, in 2009, China surpassed the United States as the leading 
        trade partner of African countries. In the last 10 years, 
        African trade with China has increased from $11,000,000,000 to 
        $166,000,000,000.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) The Export-Import Bank of the United States 
        substantially increased lending to United States businesses 
        focused on Africa from $400,000,000 in 2009 to $1,400,000,000 
        in 2011, but the Export-Import Bank of China dwarfed this 
        effort with an estimated $12,000,000,000 worth of financing. 
        Overall, China is outpacing the United States in selling goods 
        to Africa at a rate of 3 to 1.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Other countries such as India, Turkey, Russia, 
        and Brazil are also aggressively seeking markets in Africa 
        using their national export banks to provide concessional 
        assistance.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) The Chinese practice of concessional financing 
        runs contrary to the principles of the Organization of Economic 
        Co-operation and Development related to open market rates, 
        undermines naturally competitive rates, and can allow 
        governments in Africa to overlook the troubling record on labor 
        practices, human rights, and environmental impact.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) As stated in a recent report entitled 
        ``Embracing Africa's Economic Potential'' by Senator Chris 
        Coons, ``Economic growth in Africa has risen dramatically, but 
        the continent's vast economic potential has not yet been fully 
        realized by the U.S. Government or the American private 
        sector.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) The African continent is undergoing a period 
        of rapid growth and middle class development, as seen from 
        major indicators such as Internet use, clean water access, and 
        real income growth. In the last decade alone, the percentage of 
        the population with access to the Internet has doubled. 
        Seventy-eight percent of Africa's rural population now has 
        access to clean water. Over the past 10 years, real income per 
        person in Africa has grown by more than 30 percent.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) Economists have designated Africa as the 
        ``next frontier market'', with profitability of many African 
        firms and growth rates of African countries exceeding global 
        averages in recent years. Countries in Africa have a collective 
        spending power of almost $9,000,000,000 and a gross domestic 
        product of $1,600,000,000,000, which are projected to double in 
        the next 10 years.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (12) In the past 10 years, Africa has been home to 
        6 of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world. Sub-Saharan 
        Africa is projected to have the fastest growing economies in 
        the world over the next 10 years, with 7 of the 10 fastest 
        growing economies located in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (13) When countries such as China assist with 
        large-scale government projects, they also gain an upper hand 
        in relations with African leaders and access to valuable 
        commodities such as oil and copper, typically without regard to 
        environmental, human rights, labor, or governance 
        standards.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (14) Unless the United States can offer 
        competitive financing for its firms in Africa, it will be 
        deprived of opportunities to participate in African efforts to 
        close the continent's significant infrastructure gap that 
        amounts to an estimated $100,000,000,000.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create jobs in 
the United States by expanding programs that will result in increasing 
United States exports to Africa by 200 percent in real dollar value 
within 10 years.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) has been successful in helping the 
                African diaspora in the United States participate in 
                economic growth in Africa;&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                economic integration in Africa; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (G) has made a meaningful contribution to 
                the transformation of Africa and its full integration 
                into the 21st century world economy, not only as a 
                supplier of primary products but also as full 
                participant in international supply and distribution 
                chains and as a consumer of international goods and 
                services.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 5. SPECIAL AFRICA STRATEGY COORDINATOR.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The President shall designate an individual to serve as

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to coordinate with the Trade Promotion 
        Coordinating Committee, (the interagency AGOA committees), and 
        development agencies with respect to developing and 
        implementing the strategy.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 6. TRADE MISSION TO AFRICA.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the sense of Congress that, not later than 1 year 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce

conduct a joint trade mission to Africa.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 7. PERSONNEL.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) facilitating the access of 
                        United States businesses to risk insurance, 
                        equity investments, consulting services, and 
                        lending provided by that bank.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Export-Import Bank of the United States.--Of the 
amounts collected by the Export-Import Bank that remain after paying 
the expenses the Bank is authorized to pay from such amounts for 
administrative expenses, the Bank shall use sufficient funds to do the 
following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Increase the number of staff dedicated to 
        expanding business development for Africa, including increasing 
        the number of business development trips the Bank conducts to 
        Africa and the amount of time staff spends in Africa to meet 
        the goals set forth in section 9 and paragraph (4) of section 
        6(a) of the Export-Import Bank of 1945, as added by section 
        9(a)(2).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Maintain an appropriate number of employees of 
        the Bank assigned to United States field offices of the Bank to 
        be distributed as geographically appropriate through the United 
        States. Such offices shall coordinate with the related export 
        efforts undertaken by the Small Business Administration 
        regional field offices.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Upgrade the Bank's equipment and software to 
        more expeditiously, effectively, and efficiently process and 
        track applications for financing received by the 
        Bank.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Overseas Private Investment Corporation.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Staffing.--Of the net offsetting collections 
        collected by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation used 
        for administrative expenses, the Corporation shall use 
        sufficient funds to increase by not more than 5 the staff 
        needed to promote stable and sustainable economic growth and 
        development in Africa, to strengthen and expand the private 
        sector in Africa, and to facilitate the general economic 
        development of Africa, with a particular focus on helping 
        United States businesses expand into African markets.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Report.--The Corporation shall report to the 
        appropriate congressional committees on whether recent 
        technology upgrades have resulted in more effective and 
        efficient processing and tracking of applications for financing 
        received by the Corporation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Certain costs not considered administrative 
        expenses.--For purposes of this subsection, systems 
        infrastructure costs associated with activities authorized by 
        title IV of chapter 2 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act 
        of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 231 et seq.) shall not be considered 
        administrative expenses.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
be construed as permitting the reduction of Department of Commerce, 
Department of State, Export-Import Bank, or Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation personnel or the alteration of planned personnel increases 
in other regions, except where a personnel decrease was previously 
anticipated or where decreased export opportunities justify personnel 
reductions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 8. TRAINING.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The President shall develop a plan--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) to standardize the training received by United 
        States and Foreign Commercial Service officers, economic 
        officers of the Department of State, and economic officers of 
        the United States Agency for International Development with 
        respect to the programs and procedures of the Export-Import 
        Bank of the United States, the Overseas Private Investment 
        Corporation, the Small Business Administration, and the United 
        States Trade and Development Agency; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) to ensure that, not later than 1 year after 
        the date of the enactment of this Act--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) all United States and Foreign 
                Commercial Service officers that are stationed overseas 
                receive the training described in paragraph (1); 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) in the case of a country to which no 
                United States and Foreign Commercial Service officer is 
                assigned, any economic officer of the Department of 
                State stationed in that country shall receive that 
                training.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 9. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK FINANCING.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Financing for Projects in Africa.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of 
        Congress that foreign export credit agencies are providing non-
        OECD arrangement compliant financing in Africa, which is trade 
        distorting and threatens United States jobs.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) In general.--Section 6(a) of the Export-Import 
        Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635e(a)) is amended by adding at 
        the end the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(4) Percent of financing to be used for projects 
        in africa.--The Bank shall, to the extent that there are 
        acceptable final applications, increase the amount it finances 
        to Africa over the prior year's financing for each of the first 
        five fiscal years beginning after the date of the enactment of 
        the Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa 
        Act of 2013.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date 
        of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 5 
        years, the Export-Import Bank shall report to the Committee on 
        Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Foreign 
        Relations, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate 
        and the Committee on Financial Services, the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
        House of Representatives if the Bank has not used at least 10 
        percent of its lending capabilities for projects in Africa as 
        described in paragraph (4) of section 6(a) of the Export-Import 
        Bank of 1945, as added by paragraph (2). The report shall 
        include the reasons why the Bank failed to reach this goal and 
        a description of all final applications for projects in Africa 
        that were deemed unworthy of Bank support.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Availability of Portion of Capitalization To Compete 
Against Foreign Concessional Loans.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The Bank shall make available 
        annually such amounts as are necessary for loans that counter 
        trade distorting non-OECD arrangement compliant financing or 
        preferential, tied aid, or other related non-market loans 
        offered by other nations for which United States companies are 
        also competing or interested in competing.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date 
        of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 5 
        years, the Export-Import Bank shall submit to the Committee on 
        Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Foreign 
        Relations, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate 
        and the Committee on Financial Services, the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
        House of Representatives a report on all loans made or rejected 
        that were considered to counter non-OECD arrangement compliant 
        financing offered by other nations to its firms. The report 
        shall not disclose any information that is confidential or 
        business proprietary, or that would violate section 1905 of 
        title 18, United States Code (commonly referred to as the 
        ``Trade Secrets Act''). The report shall include a description 
        of trade distorting non-OECD arrangement compliant financing 
        loans made by other countries during that fiscal year to firms 
        that competed against the United States firms.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 10. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Section 22(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 649(b)) 
is amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by 
        inserting ``the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee,'' after 
        ``Director of the United States Trade and Development 
        Agency,''; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``regional 
        offices of the Export-Import Bank,'' after ``Retired 
        Executives,''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 11. BILATERAL, SUBREGIONAL AND REGIONAL, AND MULTILATERAL 
              AGREEMENTS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Where applicable, the President shall explore 
opportunities to negotiate bilateral, subregional, and regional 
agreements that encourage trade and eliminate nontariff barriers to 
trade between countries, such as negotiating investor friendly double-
taxation treaties and investment promotion agreements. United States 
negotiators in multilateral forum should take into account the 
objectives of this Act. To the extent any such agreements exist between 
the United States and an African country, the President shall ensure 
that the agreement is being implemented in a manner that maximizes the 
positive effects for United States trade, export, and labor interests 
as well as the economic development of the countries in 
Africa.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing American Jobs Through 
Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Export growth helps United States businesses grow and 
        create American jobs. In 2011, United States exports supported 
        9,700,000 jobs and 97.8 percent of United States exports came 
        from small- and medium-sized businesses in 2010.
            (2) The more than 20 Federal agencies that are involved in 
        export promotion and financing are not sufficiently coordinated 
        to adequately expand United States commercial exports to 
        Africa.
            (3) The President has taken steps to improve how the United 
        States Government supports American businesses by mandating an 
        executive review across agencies and a new Doing Business in 
        Africa initiative, but a substantially greater high-level focus 
        on Africa is needed.
            (4) Many other countries have trade promotion programs that 
        aggressively compete against United States exports in Africa 
        and around the world. For example, in 2010, medium- and long-
        term official export credit general volumes from the Group of 7 
        countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United 
        Kingdom, and the United States) totaled $65,400,000,000. 
        Germany provided the largest level of support at 
        $22,500,000,000, followed by France at $17,400,000,000 and the 
        United States at $13,000,000,000. Official export credit 
        support by emerging market economies such as Brazil, China, and 
        India are significant as well.
            (5) Between 2008 and 2010, China alone provided more than 
        $110,000,000,000 in loans to the developing world, and, in 
        2009, China surpassed the United States as the leading trade 
        partner of African countries. In the last 10 years, African 
        trade with China has increased from $11,000,000,000 to 
        $166,000,000,000.
            (6) The Export-Import Bank of the United States 
        substantially increased lending to United States businesses 
        focused on Africa from $400,000,000 in 2009 to $1,400,000,000 
        in 2011, but the Export-Import Bank of China dwarfed this 
        effort with an estimated $12,000,000,000 worth of financing. 
        Overall, China is outpacing the United States in selling goods 
        to Africa at a rate of 3 to 1.
            (7) Other countries such as India, Turkey, Russia, and 
        Brazil are also aggressively seeking markets in Africa using 
        their national export banks to provide concessional assistance.
            (8) The Chinese practice of concessional financing runs 
        contrary to the principles of the Organization of Economic Co-
        operation and Development related to open market rates, 
        undermines naturally competitive rates, and can allow 
        governments in Africa to overlook the troubling record on labor 
        practices, human rights, and environmental impact.
            (9) As stated in a recent report entitled ``Embracing 
        Africa's Economic Potential'' by Senator Chris Coons, 
        ``Economic growth in Africa has risen dramatically, but the 
        continent's vast economic potential has not yet been fully 
        realized by the U.S. Government or the American private 
        sector.''
            (10) The African continent is undergoing a period of rapid 
        growth and middle class development, as seen from major 
        indicators such as Internet use, clean water access, and real 
        income growth. In the last decade alone, the percentage of the 
        population with access to the Internet has doubled. Seventy-
        eight percent of Africa's rural population now has access to 
        clean water. Over the past 10 years, real income per person in 
        Africa has grown by more than 30 percent. Such economic growth 
        will expand even faster if more reliable energy production is 
        achieved--a business sector in which American industry excels.
            (11) Economists have designated Africa as the ``next 
        frontier market'', with profitability of many African firms and 
        growth rates of African countries exceeding global averages in 
        recent years. Countries in Africa have a collective spending 
        power of almost $9,000,000,000 and a gross domestic product of 
        $1,600,000,000,000, which are projected to double in the next 
        10 years.
            (12) In the past 10 years, Africa has been home to 6 of the 
        10 fastest growing economies in the world. Sub-Saharan Africa 
        is projected to have the fastest growing economies in the world 
        over the next 10 years, with 7 of the 10 fastest growing 
        economies located in sub-Saharan Africa.
            (13) When countries such as China assist with large-scale 
        government projects, they also gain an upper hand in relations 
        with African leaders and access to valuable commodities such as 
        oil and copper, typically without regard to environmental, 
        human rights, labor, or governance standards.
            (14) Unless the United States can offer competitive 
        financing for its firms in Africa, it will be deprived of 
        opportunities to participate in African efforts to close the 
        continent's significant infrastructure gap that amounts to an 
        estimated $100,000,000,000.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create jobs in the 
United States by expanding programs that will result in increasing 
United States exports to Africa by 200 percent in real dollar value 
within 10 years.

        communities in Africa tackle economic, development, and 
        infrastructure financing needs;
            (6) promoting economic integration in Africa through 
        working with the subregional economic communities, supporting

SEC. 9. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK FINANCING.

    (a) Financing for Projects in Africa.--
            (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
        foreign export credit agencies are providing non-OECD 
        arrangement compliant financing in Africa, which is trade 
        distorting and threatens United States jobs.
            (2) In general.--Section 6(a) of the Export-Import Bank Act 
        of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635e(a)) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following:
            ``(4) Percent of financing to be used for projects in 
        africa.--The Bank shall, to the extent that there are 
        acceptable final applications, increase the amount it finances 
        to Africa over the prior year's financing for each of the first 
        five fiscal years beginning after the date of the enactment of 
        the Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa 
        Act of 2013.''.
            (3) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 5 years, the 
        Export-Import Bank shall report to the Committee on Banking, 
        Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
        and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the 
        Committee on Financial Services, the Committee on Foreign 
        Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of 
        Representatives if the Bank has not used at least 10 percent of 
        its lending capabilities for projects in Africa as described in 
        paragraph (4) of section 6(a) of the Export-Import Bank of 
        1945, as added by paragraph (2). The report shall include the 
        reasons why the Bank failed to reach this goal and a 
        description of all final applications for projects in Africa 
        that were deemed unworthy of Bank support.
    (b) Availability of Portion of Capitalization To Compete Against 
Foreign Concessional Loans.--
            (1) In general.--The Bank shall make available annually 
        such amounts as are necessary for loans that counter trade 
        distorting non-OECD arrangement compliant financing or 
        preferential, tied aid, or other related non-market loans 
        offered by other nations for which United States companies are 
        also competing or interested in competing.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 5 years, the 
        Export-Import Bank shall submit to the Committee on Banking, 
        Housing, and Urban Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
        and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the 
        Committee on Financial Services, the Committee on Foreign 
        Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of 
        Representatives a report on all loans made or rejected that 
        were considered to counter non-OECD arrangement compliant 
        financing offered by other nations to its firms. The report 
        shall not disclose any information that is confidential or 
        business proprietary, or that would violate section 1905 of 
        title 18, United States Code (commonly referred to as the 
        ``Trade Secrets Act''). The report shall include a description 
        of trade distorting non-OECD arrangement compliant financing 
        loans made by other countries during that fiscal year to firms 
        that competed against the United States firms.

SEC. 10. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.

    Section 22(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 649(b)) is 
amended--
            (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by inserting 
        ``the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee,'' after 
        ``Director of the United States Trade and Development 
        Agency,''; and
            (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``regional offices of 
        the Export-Import Bank,'' after ``Retired Executives,''.

SEC. 11. BILATERAL, SUBREGIONAL AND REGIONAL, AND MULTILATERAL 
              AGREEMENTS.

    Where applicable, the President shall explore opportunities to 
negotiate bilateral, subregional, and regional agreements that 
encourage trade and eliminate nontariff barriers to trade between 
countries, such as negotiating investor friendly double-taxation 
treaties and investment promotion agreements. United States negotiators 
in multilateral forum should take into account the objectives of this 
Act. To the extent any such agreements exist between the United States 
and an African country, the President shall ensure that the agreement 
is being implemented in a manner that maximizes the positive effects 
for United States trade, export, and labor interests as well as the 
economic development of the countries in Africa.
