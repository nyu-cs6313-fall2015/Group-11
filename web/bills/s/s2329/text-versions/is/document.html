 TITLE I--PREVENTION OF ACCESS BY HEZBOLLAH TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL 
                         AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS

SEC. 101. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States Government holds Hezbollah 
        responsible for the largest number of American deaths overseas 
        by a terrorist organization prior to the attacks of September 
        11, 2001, including a number of attacks on and hostage takings 
        targeting Americans in Lebanon during the 1980s, including the 
        bombing of the United States Embassy in Beirut in April 1983 
        and the bombing of the United States Marine barracks in October 
        1983.
            (2) Hezbollah's operations outside of Lebanon, including 
        its participation in bombings of Israeli and Jewish 
        institutions in Argentina during the 1990s, recent support to 
        Shiite insurgents in Iraq, recent attacks and attempted attacks 
        in Europe, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere, and extensive 
        international operational, logistical, and financial networks 
        have rendered it a capable and deadly adversary with global 
        reach.
            (3) Hezbollah has been designated as a terrorist 
        organization by the United States since 1995, and remains on 
        foreign terrorist organization and Specially Designated 
        Terrorist lists.
            (4) In March 2013, a Cypriot court convicted a Hezbollah 
        member for participation in a criminal organization, planning 
        to commit a crime and money laundering. In June 2013, the 
        Government of Bulgaria concluded that Hezbollah was responsible 
        for the 2012 Burgas bombing, which killed 6 people.
            (5) In July 2013, the European Union designated the 
        military wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. The 
        designation helps to facilitate European law enforcement 
        agencies' actions against Hezbollah's fundraising, logistical 
        activity, and terrorist plotting on European soil.
            (6) In July 2013, the Gulf Cooperation Council, consisting 
        of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and the United 
        Arab Emirates, declared Hezbollah a terrorist organization.
            (7) Hezbollah continues to provide material assistance, 
        including assuming a combat role, in Syria, and aids the 
        Government of Iran and the Government of Syria in their human 
        rights and other abuses perpetrated against the Syrian people.
            (8) An estimated 5,000 Hezbollah fighters are supporting 
        the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria by fighting on his 
        behalf and by providing military training, advice, and 
        logistical support to regime forces.
            (9) Hezbollah continues to serve as a proxy of Iran, in its 
        effort to target the United States and its allies and 
        interests.
            (10) Hezbollah's global logistics and financial network 
        serves as a lifeline to the organization, and enables it to 
        consolidate power within Lebanon and provides it with the 
        capabilities to perpetrate complex attacks internationally.
            (11) Hezbollah has evolved into a significant drug 
        smuggling organization, and also engages in other serious 
        criminal activity, including money laundering, counterfeiting 
        pharmaceuticals, and trade in conflict diamonds.
            (12) In April 2013, the Department of the Treasury 
        blacklisted two Lebanese exchange houses, Kassem Rmeiti & Co. 
        and Halawi Exchange Co., for laundering drug profits for 
        Hezbollah.
            (13) In February 2011, the Department of the Treasury 
        blacklisted the Lebanese Canadian Bank as of primary money 
        laundering concern, alleging that it moved approximately 
        $200,000,000 as part of a drug trafficking network that 
        profited Hezbollah.
            (14) The Department of Justice reports that 29 of the 63 
        organizations on its Fiscal Year 2010 Consolidated Priority 
        Organization Targets list, which includes the most significant 
        international drug trafficking organizations threatening the 
        United States, were associated with terrorist groups. There is 
        concern about Hezbollah's drug and criminal activities, as well 
        as indications of links between al-Qaeda in the Lands of the 
        Islamic Maghreb and the drug trade.
            (15) Al-Manar, the Lebanese satellite television station 
        affiliated with Hezbollah broadcasting from Beirut, Lebanon, 
        was designated as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist 
        entity in May 2006, but continues to be carried by 
        international broadcasting agents.
            (16) Hezbollah continues to present a threat to the United 
        States and its allies and interests.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to--
            (1) prevent Hezbollah's global logistics and financial 
        network from operating in order to curtail funding of its 
        domestic and international activities; and
            (2) utilize all available diplomatic, legislative, and 
        executive avenues to combat the criminal activities of 
        Hezbollah as a means to block the ability of Hezbollah to fund 
        its global terrorist activities.

                services to carry out an activity described in

            (3) Penalties.--The penalties provided for in subsections 
        (b) and (c) of section 206 of the International Emergency
