        research or analysis with respect to--
                    (A) screening and intervention for maternal 
                substance abuse, including the misuse or abuse of 
                prescription drugs in women of childbearing age and

                    (B) treatment for pregnant and postpartum women 
                with a substance use disorder, including the misuse or

                    (C) screening of infants for neonatal abstinence 
                syndrome and for the risk of developing neonatal 
                abstinence syndrome;
                    (D) treatment for infants with neonatal abstinence 
                syndrome, including evidence-informed recommendations 
                surrounding evaluation and treatment with

            (3) factors related to neonatal abstinence syndrome, 
        including--
                    (A) epidemiological studies concerning neonatal
