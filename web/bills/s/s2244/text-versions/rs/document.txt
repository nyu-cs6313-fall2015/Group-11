Insurance Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 6701 note) (hereafter in this section 
referred to as the ``Program'').
    (b) Required Content.--The study required under subsection (a) 
shall examine, but shall not be limited to, the following issues:
            (1) How the Federal Government could determine the price of 
        such upfront premiums on insurers that participate in the 
        Program.
            (2) How the Federal Government could collect and manage 
        such upfront premiums.
            (3) How the Federal Government could ensure that such 
        upfront premiums are not spent for purposes other than claims 
        through the Program.
            (4) How the assessment and collection of such upfront 
        premiums could affect take-up rates for terrorism risk coverage 
        in different regions and industries and how it could impact 
        small businesses and consumers in both metropolitan and non-
        metropolitan areas.
            (5) The effect of collecting such upfront premiums on 
        insurers both large and small.
            (6) The effect of collecting such upfront premiums on the 
        private market for terrorism risk reinsurance.
            (7) The size of any Federal Government subsidy insurers may 
        receive through their participation in the Program, taking into 
        account the Program's current post-event recoupment structure.
    (c) Report.--Upon completion of the study required under subsection 
(a), the Comptroller General shall submit a report on the results of 
such study to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of 
the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives.
    (d) Public Availability.--The study and report required under this 
section shall be made available to the public in electronic form and 
shall be published on the website of the Government Accountability 
Office.
