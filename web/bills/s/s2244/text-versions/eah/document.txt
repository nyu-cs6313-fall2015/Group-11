SEC. 108. GAO STUDY.

    (a) Study.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall complete a 
study on the viability and effects of the Federal Government--
            (1) assessing and collecting upfront premiums on insurers 
        that participate in the Terrorism Insurance Program established 
        under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 6701 
        note) (hereafter in this section referred to as the 
        ``Program''), which shall include a comparison of practices in 
        international markets to assess and collect premiums either 
        before or after terrorism losses are incurred; and
            (2) creating a capital reserve fund under the Program and 
        requiring insurers participating in the Program to dedicate 
        capital specifically for terrorism losses before such losses 
        are incurred, which shall include a comparison of practices in 
        international markets to establish reserve funds.
    (b) Required Content.--The study required under subsection (a) 
shall examine, but shall not be limited to, the following issues:
            (1) Upfront premiums.--With respect to upfront premiums 
        described in subsection (a)(1)--
                    (A) how the Federal Government could determine the 
                price of such upfront premiums on insurers that 
                participate in the Program;
                    (B) how the Federal Government could collect and 
                manage such upfront premiums;
                    (C) how the Federal Government could ensure that 
                such upfront premiums are not spent for purposes other 
                than claims through the Program;
                    (D) how the assessment and collection of such 
                upfront premiums could affect take-up rates for 
                terrorism risk coverage in different regions and 
                industries and how it could impact small businesses and 
                consumers in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan 
                areas;
                    (E) the effect of collecting such upfront premiums 
                on insurers both large and small;
                    (F) the effect of collecting such upfront premiums 
                on the private market for terrorism risk reinsurance; 
                and
                    (G) the size of any Federal Government subsidy 
                insurers may receive through their participation in the 
                Program, taking into account the Program's current 
                post-event recoupment structure.
            (2) Capital reserve fund.--With respect to the capital 
        reserve fund described in subsection (a)(2)--
                    (A) how the creation of a capital reserve fund 
                would affect the Federal Government's fiscal exposure 
                under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program and the 
                ability of the Program to meet its statutory purposes;
                    (B) how a capital reserve fund would impact 
                insurers and reinsurers, including liquidity, insurance 
                pricing, and capacity to provide terrorism risk 
                coverage;
                    (C) the feasibility of segregating funds 
                attributable to terrorism risk from funds attributable 
                to other insurance lines;
                    (D) how a capital reserve fund would be viewed and 
                treated under current Financial Accounting Standards 
                Board accounting rules and the tax laws; and
                    (E) how a capital reserve fund would affect the 
                States' ability to regulate insurers participating in 
                the Program.
            (3) International practices.--With respect to international 
        markets referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection 
        (a), how other countries, if any--
                    (A) have established terrorism insurance 
                structures;
                    (B) charge premiums or otherwise collect funds to 
                pay for the costs of terrorism insurance structures, 
                including risk and administrative costs; and
                    (C) have established capital reserve funds to pay 
                for the costs of terrorism insurance structures.

        separate classes of membership, with separate criteria, if the

        duties requires different levels of education, training, 
        experience, or other qualifications.

        class of membership and membership criteria for business

                on the types of licensing categories that exist under

        Association shall not establish criteria that unfairly limit 
        the ability of a small insurance producer to become a member of 
        the Association, including imposing discriminatory membership 
        fees.

        Model Act in effect as of the date of enactment of the National
