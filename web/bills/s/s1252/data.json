Prohibits resource protection, mitigation, or enhancement measures required by FERC hydropower proceedings from being considered project works under this Act. Permits such measures within the segments.\n\nConsiders zoning ordinances adopted by specific towns as satisfying provisions in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act that prohibit the Secretary from acquiring lands by condemnation within a designated Wild and Scenic River boundary when certain local zoning ordinances are in place.\n\n Limits the authority of the Secretary to acquire lands under this Act to acquisition by donation or with the owner's consent.\n\nBars the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers from being administered as part of the National Park System.\n\nDirects the Secretary, upon determining that there is adequate local support for the designation of an additional segment in Vermont, to publish a notice of the designation in the Federal Register, designate the additional segment, and administer the additional segment as a recreational river."
