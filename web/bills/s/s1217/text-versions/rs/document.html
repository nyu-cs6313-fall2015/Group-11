&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Precondition; Ensuring Placement of First Loss 
Capital.--The Corporation shall develop standards and processes to 
ensure that prior to making any commitment to provide insurance under

cover their risk-sharing obligations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Cash Payments; Continued Operations.--In the event of 
a payment default on an eligible mortgage that collateralizes a covered 
security insured under this section that exceeds the first loss 
position assumed by a private market holder or that, in the case of an 
approved bond guarantor, if the guarantor has become insolvent, the 
Corporation shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) pay, in cash when due, any shortfalls in

private market holder of the first loss position on a covered security 
which, on or after the date of enactment of this Act, has defaulted on 
its obligations, is at risk of defaulting, or is likely to default, 
absent such assistance from the United States Government.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

agreement of the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System and the Secretary of the Treasury, and in consultation 
with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, determines that 
unusual and exigent circumstances have created or threatened to create 
an anomalous lack of mortgage credit availability within the housing 
markets that could materially and severely disrupt the functioning of 
the housing finance system of the United States, the Corporation may, 
for a period not to exceed 6 months, provide insurance in accord with 
section 204 to any covered security regardless of whether such security 
has satisfied the requirements of section 202(a).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Considerations.--In exercising the authority granted 
under subsection (a), the Corporation shall consider the severity of 
the conditions present in the housing markets and the risks presented

under subsection (a) may not be exercised more than once in any given

        into any contract, covenant, or other agreement with an 
        approved issuer, if such contract, covenant, or agreement would 
        provide the issuer a share of the covered security issuer 
        market in excess of 15 percent of the total market, as such 
        market is measured by the total outstanding principal balance 
        at origination of eligible mortgages collateralizing covered 
        securities issued in the previous 12-month period.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                Corporation grants a waiver pursuant to paragraph

        year period beginning on the FMIC certification date, grant a 
        waiver from the limitation set forth under paragraph (1) to an 
        approved issuer if the Corporation determines that the number 
        of approved issuers is insufficient, such that imposition of 
        the limitation would adversely affect the availability of 
        mortgage credit.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (g) Limited Authority To Hold Eligible Mortgage Loans.--An

        eligible mortgages and insured by the Corporation.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Required standards.--The standards required 
        under paragraph (1) shall include--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the financial history and condition of 
                the guarantor;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) that the guarantor maintain a minimum 
                capital level equal to not less than 10 percent of the 
                unpaid principal balance of outstanding mortgage-backed 
                securities for which the guarantor is providing 
                insurance, net of any transactions, including 
                derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse 
                repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions, 
                or securities borrowing transactions, that in the 
                determination of the Corporation are used by the 
                guarantor to hedge or mitigate against credit risk, 
                provided that any such hedging transaction does not 
                diminish the total amount of loss absorption capital in 
                the secondary mortgage market that stands in front of 
                the insurance provided by the Corporation under this 
                title;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the general character and fitness of 
                the management of the guarantor, including compliance

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) a requirement that the guarantor 
                submit audited financial statements to the 
                Director;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (G) a requirement that the guarantor meet 
                a minimum tangible common equity level, or other 
                minimum capital threshold as the Corporation determines 
                necessary; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (H) any other standard the Corporation 
                determines necessary or appropriate.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Rule of Construction.--Any covered security issued by 
an approved issuer and insured by an approved bond guarantor shall be 
deemed to have satisfied the credit-risk sharing requirements under 
section 202(a)(1) with respect to the eligibility of that security to 
obtain insurance under this title.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Application and Approval.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Approval.--The Corporation may approve any 
        application made pursuant to paragraph (1) provided the bond 
        guarantor meets the standards adopted under subsection 
        (a).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Publication.--The Corporation shall--

                Corporation shall revoke the approved status of such 
                guarantor.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Rule of construction.--The revocation

        establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of 
        civil money penalties under this section. Such standards and 
        procedures--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                notify the approved private mortgage insurer, servicer, 
                issuer, or bond guarantor, as the case may be, in 
                writing of the determination of the Corporation to 
                impose the penalty, which shall be made on the 
                record;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) shall provide for the imposition of a 
                penalty only after the approved private mortgage 
                insurer, servicer, issuer, or bond guarantor, as the 
                case may be, has been given an opportunity for a 
                hearing on the record; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) may provide for review by the 
                Corporation of any determination or order, or

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Factors determining amount of penalty.--In 
        determining the amount of a penalty under this section, the

                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (G) such other factors as the Corporation 
                may determine, by regulation, to be 
                appropriate.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Action To Collect Penalty.--If the approved private 
mortgage insurer, servicer, issuer, or bond guarantor, as the case may 
be, fails to comply with an order by the Corporation imposing a civil 
money penalty under this section, the Corporation may bring an action 
in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to 
obtain a monetary judgment against the approved private mortgage 
insurer, servicer, issuer, or bond guarantor, as the case may be, and 
such other relief as may be available. The monetary judgment may, in 
the court's discretion, include the attorneys' fees and other expenses 
incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an 
action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the 
order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Settlements.--The Corporation may compromise, modify, 
or remit any civil money penalty which may be, or has been, imposed 
under this section.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        financial condition, risk management practices or any other 
        practice of any approved private mortgage insurer, servicer, 
        issuer, or bond guarantor.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Privilege preserved.--Information shared by

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Rule of construction.--No provision of this 
        subsection may be construed as implying or establishing that--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) any person waives any privilege 
                applicable to information that is shared or transferred

        the senior preferred shareholders under paragraph (1), to the 
        extent that such resolutions--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) are consistent with the goal of 
                supporting a sound, stable, and liquid housing 
                market;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) are consistent with applicable Federal

        this Act, if the Director of the Federal Housing Finance 
        Agency, in consultation with the Corporation and the Secretary 
        of the Treasury, determines that the sale of any line of 
        business, or any function, activity, or service of an 
        enterprise as a going concern will maximize the return for the 
        senior preferred shareholders as required under paragraph (3), 
        the Director may conduct such sale, provided that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) under no circumstance, shall such sale 
                transfer, convey, or authorize, or be deemed to

                function, activity, or service; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) such sale does not impede or otherwise 
                interfere with the ability of the Federal Mortgage 
                Insurance Corporation to carry out the functions and 
                requirements of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 504. CONFORMING LOAN LIMITS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Beginning on the date of enactment of 
this Act, the limitations governing the maximum original principal 
obligation of conventional mortgages that may be purchased by the 
Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corporation, referred to in section 302(b)(2) of the Federal 
National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1717(b)(2)) and 
section 305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act (12 
U.S.C. 1454(a)(2)), respectively, shall not exceed $417,000 for a 
mortgage secured by a single-family residence, $533,850 for a mortgage 
secured by a 2-family residence, $645,300 for a mortgage secured by a 
3-family residence, and $801,950 for a mortgage secured by a 4-family 
residence, except that such maximum limitations shall be adjusted 
effective January 1 of each year beginning after the date of enactment 
of this Act, subject to the limitations in this paragraph. Each 
adjustment shall be made by adding to each such amount (as it may have 
been previously adjusted) a percentage thereof equal to the percentage 
increase, during the most recent 12-month or 4-quarter period ending 
before the time of determining such annual adjustment, in the housing 
price index maintained pursuant to section 1322 of the Federal Housing 
Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (12 U.S.C. 
4542). If the change in such house price index during the most recent 
12-month or 4-quarter period ending before the time of determining such 
annual adjustment is a decrease, then no adjustment shall be made for 
the next year, and the next adjustment shall take into account prior 
declines in the house price index, so that any adjustment shall reflect 
the net change in the house price index since the last adjustment. 
Declines in the house price index shall be accumulated and then reduce 
increases until subsequent increases exceed prior declines.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Special Exception for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and 
USVI.--The limitations set forth under subsection (a) shall be 
increased by not to exceed 50 per centum with respect to properties

subsection (a) shall also be increased, with respect to properties of a 
particular size located in any area for which 115 percent of the median 
house price for such size residence exceeds the limitation under 
subsection (a) for such size residence--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) for the first year following the date of 
        enactment of this Act, to the lesser of 150 percent of such 
        limitation for such size residence or the amount that is equal 
        to 115 percent of the median house price in such area for such 
        size residence;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) for the second year following the date of 
        enactment of this Act, to the lesser of 145 percent of such 
        limitation for such size residence or the amount that is equal 
        to 115 percent of the median house price in such area for such 
        size residence;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) for the third year following the date of 
        enactment of this Act, to the lesser of 135 percent of such 
        limitation for such size residence or the amount that is equal 
        to 115 percent of the median house price in such area for such 
        size residence;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) for the fourth year following the date of 
        enactment of this Act, to the lesser of 130 percent of such 
        limitation for such size residence or the amount that is equal 
        to 115 percent of the median house price in such area for such 
        size residence; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) for the fifth year following the date of 
        enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter, to the lesser 
        of 125 percent of such limitation for such size residence or 
        the amount that is equal to 115 percent of the median house 
        price in such area for such size residence.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--Each enterprise shall not own, as 
        of any applicable date, mortgage assets in excess of--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) as of December 31, 2013, 
                $552,500,000,000; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                until the FMIC certification date, 85 percent of the 
                aggregate amount of the mortgage assets that the 
                enterprise was permitted to own as of December 31 of 
                the immediately preceding calendar year.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Retained portfolio to facilitate orderly wind 
        down.--On December 31 of the year in which the FMIC 
        certification date occurs, the Corporation shall establish an 
        allowable amount of enterprise owned mortgage assets in an 
        amount equal to the amount necessary to facilitate--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the orderly wind down of the 
                enterprises; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) appropriate loss mitigation on any 
                legacy guarantees of the enterprises.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Mortgage Assets Defined.--For purposes of this 
section, the term ``mortgage assets'' means, with respect to an 
enterprise, assets of such enterprise consisting of mortgages, mortgage 
loans, mortgage-related securities, participation certificates, 
mortgage-backed commercial paper, obligations of real estate mortgage 
investment conduits and similar assets, in each case to the extent such 
assets would appear on the balance sheet of such enterprise in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect in 
the United States as of September 7, 2008 (as set forth in the opinions 
and pronouncements of the Accounting Principles Board and the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and statements and 
pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board from time to 
time; and without giving any effect to any change that may be made 
after September 7, 2008, in respect of Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 140 or any similar accounting 
standard).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                                of the Mortgage Insurance Fund or of

SEC. 302. STANDARDS FOR CREDIT RISK-SHARING MECHANISMS.

    (a) Approval.--
            (1) Authority.--The Corporation shall develop, adopt, and 
        publish, after notice and comment, standards for the 
        consideration and, as appropriate, the approval of credit risk-
        sharing mechanisms that shall require that the first loss 
        position of private market holders on single-family covered 
        securities is--
                    (A) adequate to cover losses that might be incurred 
                in a period of economic stress, including national and 
                regional home price declines, such as those observed 
                during moderate to severe recessions in the United 
                States; and
                    (B) not less than 10 percent of the principal or

                time of issuance.
            (2) Fraud prohibition.--
                    (A) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for any 
                person to intentionally create and issue any instrument 
                or security as a first loss position on a single-family 
                covered security that such person knows or in the 
                exercise of reasonable care should have known does not 
                satisfy the requirements of this section.
                    (B) Penalty.--Violations of subparagraph (A) shall 
                be punishable in accordance with section 1343 of title 
                18, United States Code.
    (b) Approval of Credit Risk-sharing Mechanisms.--
            (1) Considerations for approval of various mechanisms.--In 
        approving credit risk-sharing mechanisms under subsection (a), 
        the Corporation shall--
                    (A) consider proposals that include credit-linked 
                structures or other instruments that are designed to 
                absorb credit losses on single-family covered 
                securities;
                    (B) consider any credit risk-sharing mechanisms 
                undertaken by the enterprises;
                    (C) ensure that the first loss position is fully 
                funded to meet the requirements of subsection 
                (a)(1)(B);
                    (D) ensure that each type of proposed mechanism--
                            (i) enables the Corporation to verify that 
                        the first loss position is fully funded;
                            (ii) minimizes any potential long-term cost 
                        to the taxpayer;
                            (iii) accommodates the availability of 
                        mortgage credit on equal and transparent terms 
                        in the secondary mortgage market for--
                                    (I) small mortgage lenders; and
                                    (II) lenders from all geographic 
                                locations, including rural locations;
                            (iv) allows for broad availability of 
                        mortgage credit and secondary mortgage market 
                        financing through fluctuations in the business 
                        cycle for eligible single-family lending across 
                        all--
                                    (I) regions;
                                    (II) localities;
                                    (III) institutions;
                                    (IV) property types, including 
                                housing serving renters; and
                                    (V) eligible borrowers;
                            (v) fulfills the requirements under section 
                        314 with respect to loan modifications and 
                        foreclosure prevention;
                            (vi) does not prevent the securitization of 
                        refinanced or modified eligible single-family 
                        mortgage loans within single-family covered 
                        securities during a period when the authority 
                        under section 305(i) is exercised;
                            (vii) does not diminish market liquidity 
                        and resiliency;
                            (viii) does not prevent the refinancing of 
                        underwater eligible single-family mortgage 
                        loans; and
                            (ix) does not present an unnecessary risk 
                        to the Mortgage Insurance Fund;
                    (E) consider whether the approval of any credit 
                risk-sharing mechanism will impair the operation and 
                liquidity of forward market executions for eligible 
                single-family mortgage loans and single-family covered 
                securities, such as the To-Be-Announced market, taking 
                into consideration other risk-sharing options available 
                to market participants; and
                    (F) take necessary steps to prevent abuse and 
                deceptive practices in the use of the credit risk-
                sharing mechanisms, including by--
                            (i) creating appropriate standards relating 
                        to--
                                    (I) the vintages or categories of 
                                covered securities that are referenced 
                                by a credit risk-sharing mechanism;
                                    (II) standardization of the terms 
                                and features of credit risk-sharing 
                                structures; and
                                    (III) measures that prevent the 
                                duplicative sale by a guarantor of the 
                                same mortgage credit risk in the same 
                                pool of eligible single-family mortgage 
                                loans; and
                            (ii) requiring additional disclosures and 
                        affirmative representations that must be made 
                        by entities that create and issue credit risk-
                        sharing mechanisms.
            (2) Notice and publication.--The Corporation shall--
                    (A) provide prompt notice to any person seeking 
                approval for a credit risk-sharing mechanism of the 
                approval or denial of that credit risk-sharing 
                mechanism; and
                    (B) make available detailed information regarding 
                approved mechanisms on the website of the Corporation.
            (3) Review of approved credit risk-sharing mechanisms.--
                    (A) Authority to suspend.--The Corporation may, 
                from time to time and in its discretion--
                            (i) conduct reviews of approved credit 
                        risk-sharing mechanisms to determine whether 
                        such credit risk-sharing mechanisms continue to 
                        satisfy the considerations for approval under 
                        paragraph (1);
                            (ii) assess the functioning of the forward 
                        market for eligible single-family mortgage 
                        loans and single-family covered securities, 
                        including the To-Be-Announced market, to 
                        determine whether any approved credit risk-
                        sharing mechanism has adversely affected the 
                        liquidity or resiliency of such market; and
                            (iii) suspend the approval of--
                                    (I) any credit risk-sharing 
                                mechanism that it determines does not 
                                satisfy the considerations for approval 
                                under paragraph (1); or
                                    (II) any credit risk-sharing 
                                mechanism that it determines has 
                                adversely affected the liquidity or 
                                resiliency of the forward market for 
                                eligible single-family mortgage loans 
                                and single-family covered securities, 
                                including the To-Be-Announced market.
                    (B) Reconsideration.--
                            (i) Development of expedited process.--The 
                        Corporation shall develop an expedited process 
                        for the reinstatement of the approval of any 
                        credit risk-sharing mechanism that is suspended 
                        under subparagraph (A)(iii).
                            (ii) Revision of mechanism.--If a credit 
                        risk-sharing mechanism is suspended under 
                        subparagraph (A)(iii), the credit risk-sharing 
                        mechanism may be adapted or revised, as 
                        necessary, for reconsideration for 
                        reinstatement of the approval of the credit 
                        risk-sharing mechanism under the expedited 
                        process developed under clause (i).
                    (C) No effect on existing mechanisms.--The 
                suspension of the approval of any credit risk-sharing 
                mechanism under subparagraph (A)(iii) shall have no 
                effect on the status of single-family covered 
                securities and related instruments using the credit 
                risk-sharing mechanism that were issued prior to the 
                suspension.
            (4) Additional credit risk-sharing mechanisms.--
                    (A) Approval.--In addition to credit risk-sharing 
                mechanisms approved by the Corporation under subsection 
                (a), the Corporation shall consider and may approve 
                additional fully-funded credit risk-sharing mechanisms 
                that--
                            (i) may be employed by an approved 
                        guarantor to manage the credit risk relating to 
                        guarantees provided for single-family covered 
                        securities; and
                            (ii) do not represent the first loss 
                        position with respect to single-family covered 
                        securities.
                    (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed to limit an approved 
                guarantor from engaging in other forms of risk-sharing 
                or risk mitigation using mechanisms that have not been 
                considered or approved by the Corporation.
            (5) Reports.--
                    (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the 
                agency transfer date, and annually thereafter until the 
                system certification date, the Corporation shall submit 
                a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
                Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on 
                Financial Services of the House of Representatives 
                that--
                            (i) discusses each credit risk-sharing 
                        mechanism that the Chairperson considered in 
                        carrying out the requirements of this section;
                            (ii) describes how the operation and 
                        execution of each approved credit risk-sharing 
                        mechanism fulfills the requirements of this 
                        section; and
                            (iii) explains how the Corporation arrived 
                        at the determinations made under clause (ii),

                defined in section 1a of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 
                U.S.C. 1a).
                    (B) Prior consultation required.--Before approving 
                any credit risk-sharing mechanism that would be exempt

                request under section 552 of title 5, United States

SEC. 304. LOAN LIMITS; HOUSING PRICE INDEX.

    (a) Establishment.--The Corporation shall establish limitations 
governing the maximum original principal obligation of eligible single-
family mortgage loans that may collateralize a covered security to be 
insured by the Corporation under this title.
    (b) Calculation of Amount.--The limitation set forth under 
subsection (a) shall be calculated with respect to the total original 
principal obligation of the eligible single-family mortgage loan and 
not merely with respect to the amount insured by the Corporation.
    (c) Maximum Limits.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        maximum limitation amount under this subsection shall not 
        exceed $417,000 for a mortgage loan secured by a 1-family 
        residence, for a mortgage loan secured by a 2-family residence 
        the limit shall equal 128 percent of the limit for a mortgage 
        loan secured by a 1-family residence, for a mortgage loan 
        secured by a 3-family residence the limit shall equal 155 
        percent of the limit for a mortgage loan secured by a 1-family 
        residence, and for a mortgage loan secured by a 4-family 
        residence the limit shall equal 192 percent of the limit for a 
        mortgage loan secured by a 1-family residence, except that such 
        maximum limitations shall be adjusted effective January 1 of 
        each year beginning after the effective date of this Act, 
        subject to the limitations in this paragraph. Each adjustment 
        shall be made by adding to each such amount (as it may have 
        been previously adjusted) a percentage thereof equal to the 
        percentage increase, during the most recent 12-month or 4-
        quarter period ending before the time of determining such 
        annual adjustment, in the housing price index maintained by the 
        Chairperson pursuant to subsection (d). If the change in such 
        house price index during the most recent 12-month or 4-quarter 
        period ending before the time of determining such annual 
        adjustment is a decrease, then no adjustment shall be made for 
        the next year, and the next upward adjustment shall take into 
        account prior declines in the house price index, so that any 
        adjustment shall reflect the net change in the house price 
        index since the last adjustment. Declines in the house price 
        index shall be accumulated and then reduce increases until 
        subsequent increases exceed prior declines.
            (2) High-cost area limits.--The limitations set forth in 
        paragraph (1) may be increased by not more than 50 percent with 
        respect to properties located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, and the 
        Virgin Islands. Such foregoing limitations shall also be 
        increased, with respect to properties of a particular size 
        located in any area for which 115 percent of the median house 
        price for such size residence exceeds the limitation for such 
        size residence set forth under paragraph (1), to the lesser of 
        150 percent of such limitation for such size residence or the 
        amount that is equal to 115 percent of the median house price 
        in such area for such size residence.
    (d) Housing Price Index.--
            (1) National index.--The Corporation shall establish and 
        maintain a method of assessing a national average single-family 
        house price for use in calculating the loan limits for eligible 
        single-family mortgage loans under subsection (c), and other 
        averages as the Corporation considers appropriate, including--
                    (A) averages based on different geographic regions; 
                and
                    (B) an average for houses whose mortgage 
                collateralized single-family covered securities.
            (2) Considerations.--In establishing the method described 
        under subsection (a), the Corporation may take into 
        consideration the data collected in carrying out the functions 
        described under section 332, and such other data, existing 
        house price indexes, and other measures as the Corporation 
        considers appropriate.

SEC. 305. AUTHORITY TO PROTECT TAXPAYERS IN UNUSUAL AND EXIGENT MARKET 
              CONDITIONS.

    (a) In General.--If the Corporation, upon the written agreement of 
the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
and the Secretary of the Treasury, and in consultation with the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, determines that unusual and 
exigent circumstances have created or threaten to create an anomalous 
lack of mortgage credit availability within the single-family housing 
market, multifamily housing market, or entire United States housing 
market that could materially and severely disrupt the functioning of 
the housing finance system of the United States, the Corporation may, 
for a period of 6 months--
            (1) provide insurance in accordance with section 303 to any 
        single-family covered security regardless of whether such 
        security has satisfied the requirements of section 302; and
            (2) establish provisional standards for approved entities, 
        notwithstanding any standard required under subtitle B or 
        section 703, pursuant to section 607.
    (b) Considerations.--In exercising the authority granted under 
subsection (a), the Corporation shall consider the severity of the 
conditions present in the housing markets and the risks presented to 
the Mortgage Insurance Fund in exercising such authority.
    (c) Terms and Conditions.--Insurance provided under subsection (a) 
shall be subject to such additional or different limitations, 
restrictions, and regulations as the Corporation may prescribe.
    (d) Bailout Strictly Prohibited.--In exercising the authority 
granted under subsection (a), the Corporation may not--

        or any other Federal or State insolvency proceeding; or
            (2) provide aid for the purpose of assisting a single and 
        specific company to avoid bankruptcy or any other Federal or 
        State insolvency proceeding.
    (e) Notice.--Not later than 7 days after authorizing insurance or 
establishing provisional standards under subsection (a), the 
Corporation shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of 
the House of Representatives a report that includes--
            (1) the justification for the exercise of authority to 
        provide such insurance or establish such provisional standards;
            (2) evidence that unusual and exigent circumstances have 
        created or threatened to create an anomalous lack of mortgage 
        credit availability within the single-family housing market, 
        multifamily housing market, or entire United States housing 
        market that could materially and severely disrupt the 
        functioning of the housing finance system of the United States; 
        and
            (3) evidence that failure to exercise such authority would 
        have undermined the safety and soundness of the housing finance 
        system.
    (f) Additional Exercise of Authority.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to the limitation under subsection 
        (g), the authority granted to the Corporation under subsection

        the written agreement of the Chairman of the Board of Governors 
        of the Federal Reserve System and the Secretary of the 
        Treasury, and in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and 
        Urban Development--
                    (A) determines--
                            (i) for a second exercise of authority 
                        under subsection (a), by an affirmative vote of 
                        \2/3\ or more of the Board of Directors then 
                        serving, that a second exercise of authority 
                        under subsection (a) is necessary; or
                            (ii) for a third exercise of authority 
                        under subsection (a), by an affirmative vote of 
                        \2/3\ or more of the Board of Directors then 
                        serving, and an affirmative vote of \2/3\ or 
                        more of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
                        Reserve System then serving, that a third 
                        exercise of authority under this section is 
                        necessary; and
                    (B) provides notice to Congress, as provided under 
                subsection (e).
            (2) Order of exercise of authority.--Any additional

period, which 3-year period shall commence upon the initial exercise of 
authority under subsection (a).
    (h) Normalization and Reduction of Risk.--Following any exercise of 
authority under this section, the Corporation shall--
            (1) establish a timeline for approved entities to meet the 
        approval standards set forth in this Act; and
            (2) in a manner and pursuant to a timeline that will 
        minimize losses to the Mortgage Insurance Fund, establish a 
        program to either--
                    (A) sell, in whole or in part, the first loss 
                position on covered securities issued pursuant to this

Decline.--
            (1) Authority.--In the event of a significant decline of 
        national home prices, in at least 2 consecutive calendar 
        quarters, the Corporation, by an affirmative vote of \2/3\ or 
        more of the Board of Directors then serving, may for a period 
        of 6 months permit the transfer of guarantees of eligible 
        mortgage loans that secure covered securities if such eligible 
        mortgage loans are refinanced, regardless of the value of the 
        underlying collateral securing such eligible mortgage loans.
            (2) Additional exercise of authority.--The authority 
        granted to the Corporation under paragraph (1) may be exercised

        mortgage loans refinanced from eligible mortgage loans in 
        covered securities.
            (4) Rule of construction.--No provision in this section 
        shall be construed as permitting the Corporation to lower any

                    (A) In general.--The regulations required under 
                this subsection shall define all such terms as are 
                necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.
                    (B) Considerations in defining instruments and 
                contracts that qualify as capital.--In defining 
                instruments and contracts that qualify as capital 
                pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Corporation--
                            (i) shall include such instruments and 
                        contracts that will absorb losses before the 
                        Mortgage Insurance Fund; and
                            (ii) may assign significance to those 
                        instruments and contracts based on the nature 
                        and risks of such instruments and contracts.
                    (C) Considerations in defining capital ratios.--
                Solely for the purposes of calculating a capital ratio 
                appropriate to the business model of the applicable 
                entity pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Corporation 
                shall consider for the denominator--
                            (i) total assets;
                            (ii) total liabilities;

                    (A) ensure the safety and soundness of a covered 
                entity;
                    (B) minimize the risk of loss to the Mortgage

                Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the 
                Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit 
                Union Administration, reduce the potential for 
                regulatory arbitrage between capital standards for 
                covered entities and capital standards promulgated by 
                Federal regulatory agencies for insured depository 
                institutions and their affiliates; and
                    (D) be specifically tailored to accommodate a 
                diverse range of business models that may be employed 
                by covered entities.
            (4) Supplemental capital requirements.--In order to prevent 
        or mitigate risks to the secondary mortgage market of the 
        United States that could arise from the material financial 
        distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of covered entities 
        that are large approved aggregators or large approved 
        guarantors that engage in covered guarantee transactions, the 
        Corporation, by regulation--
                    (A) shall establish supplemental capital 
                requirements for covered entities that are large 
                approved aggregators or large approved guarantors; and
                    (B) may establish such other standards for covered 
                entities that are large approved aggregators or large 
                approved guarantors that the Corporation determines 
                necessary or appropriate.
    (c) Market Share Limitation for Certain Large Entities.--The 
Corporation shall establish, by regulation, market share limitations 
for large approved aggregators and large approved guarantors that would 
take effect only in the event the Corporation has reason to believe the 
supplemental standards established under subsection (b)(4) are 
insufficient to prevent or mitigate risks to the secondary mortgage 
market of the United States that could arise from the material 
financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of such approved 
aggregators and approved guarantors.
    (d) Recognition of Distinctions Between the Approved Entities and 
the Federal Home Loan Banks.--
            (1) In general.--Prior to promulgating any regulation or 
        taking any other formal or informal action of general 
        applicability and future effect relating to the Federal Home 
        Loan Banks, including the issuance of an advisory document or 
        examination guidance, the Chairperson, in consultation with the 
        Office of Federal Home Loan Bank Supervision, shall consider 
        the differences between the Federal Home Loan Banks and 
        approved entities with respect to--
                    (A) the Banks'--
                            (i) cooperative ownership structure;
                            (ii) mission of providing liquidity to its 
                        members;

                        development mission;
                            (iv) capital structure; and
                            (v) joint and several liability; and
                    (B) any other differences that the Corporation 
                considers appropriate.
            (2) Capital considerations.--The Corporation, in 
        coordination with the Office of Federal Home Loan Bank 
        Supervision, shall establish capital standards, as required 
        under section 309(b), with respect to a Federal Home Loan Bank, 
        or subsidiary or joint office thereof, that is approved as an 
        aggregator under section 312, that--
                    (A) are adequate to support the role of a Federal 
                Home Loan Bank as a covered entity, consistent with the 
                safe and sound operations of the Bank or Banks 
                involved; and
                    (B) do not adversely impact the traditional 
                liquidity and advance business of the Federal Home Loan 
                Bank System or the marketability or creditworthiness of 
                Federal Home Loan Bank consolidated obligations.
    (e) Regulations Relating to Force-placed Insurance.--
            (1) In general.--The Corporation shall, by regulation, set 
        standards for the purchase of force-placed insurance by market 
        participants.
            (2) Limitation.--No standards developed, adopted, or 
        published under paragraph (1) shall concern the regulation of 
        the business of insurance or preempt any State law, regulation, 
        or procedure concerning the regulation of the business of 
        insurance.
    (f) Use and Protection of Personally Identifiable Information.--
            (1) Privacy considerations.--In collecting information from 
        any person, in publicly releasing information held by the 
        Corporation, or in requiring approved entities to publicly 
        report information, the Corporation shall take steps to ensure 
        that proprietary, personal, or confidential consumer 
        information that is protected from public disclosure under 
        section 552(b) or 552a of title 5, United States Code, or any 
        other provision of law, is not made public.
            (2) Treatment of approved entities.--With respect to the 
        application of any provision of the Right to Financial Privacy 
        Act of 1978 to a disclosure by an approved entity subject to 
        this subsection, the approved entity shall be treated as if it 
        were a ``financial institution'' as defined in section 1101 of 
        that Act (12 U.S.C. 3401).
            (3) Non disclosure.--
                    (A) In general.--Unless otherwise specified by this 
                Act, any personally identifiable information obtained

                the Inspector General of the Federal Mortgage Insurance

                        through the normal course of business of such 
                        office, division, or employee;
                            (ii) the other Federal or State agency has

                        information and sharing of information that 
                        shall conform to the standards for protection 
                        of the confidentiality of personally 
                        identifiable information and for data integrity 
                        and security that are applicable to Federal 
                        agencies; or
                            (iii) the records are relevant to a 
                        legitimate law enforcement inquiry, or 
                        intelligence or counterintelligence activity,

                        information that are tailored to the purpose or 
                        mission of the office; and

        family mortgage loans.
            (2) Requirements.--If the Corporation establishes a process 
        and criteria under paragraph (1), the Corporation--
                    (A) may grant approval to an approved guarantor or 
                an approved aggregator that applies to operate a cash 
                window for the purchase of individual eligible single-
                family mortgage loans only if the Corporation 
                determines that--

                        aggregator meets the criteria established under 
                        paragraph (1); and
                            (ii) the operation of the cash window would 
                        not pose a risk to the Mortgage Insurance Fund; 
                        and

                approved guarantor and approved aggregator, shall 
                establish standards for the regulation, supervision, 
                and operation of each cash window that an approved

                requiring such information as the Corporation may 
                require, for the approval of a guarantor under this 
                section.
                    (B) Application review.--The Corporation shall

                        affiliate of an insured depository institution 
                        to control an approved guarantor.
                            (ii) Rule of construction regarding 
                        control.--For purposes of this subparagraph, 
                        any insured depository institution or affiliate 
                        of an insured depository institution has 
                        control over an approved guarantor if the 
                        company directly or indirectly or acting 
                        through 1 or more other persons owns, controls,

                    (A) subject to a statutory disqualification 
                pursuant to section 3(a)(39) of the Securities Exchange 
                Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)); or
                    (B) suspended, removed, or prohibited from 
                participation pursuant to section 8(g) of the Federal 
                Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(g)), prohibited 
                from certain action pursuant to paragraphs (6) or (7) 
                of section 8(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act

                a written agreement or other written statement under 
                section 8(u)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
                (12 U.S.C. 1818(u)(1)), for which a violation may be 
                enforced by an appropriate Federal banking agency, or 
                subject to any final order issued with respect to any 
                administrative enforcement proceeding initiated by such 
                agency under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Act (12 U.S.C. 1818).
            (4) Notice and publication.--The Corporation shall--
                    (A) provide prompt notice to a guarantor of the 
                approval or denial of any application of the guarantor 
                to become an approved guarantor under this section;
                    (B) publish a notice in the Federal Register upon 
                approval of any guarantor; and
                    (C) maintain an updated list of approved guarantors 
                on the website of the Corporation.
    (c) Requirement to Maintain Approval Status.--
            (1) Authority to issue order.--If the Corporation 
        determines that an approved guarantor no longer meets the 
        standards for such approval or violates a requirement under 
        this Act, including any standard, regulation, or order 
        promulgated in accordance with this Act, the Corporation may--
                    (A) suspend or revoke the approved status of the 
                approved guarantor; or
                    (B) take any other action with respect to such 
                approved guarantor as may be authorized under this Act.
            (2) Rule of construction.--The suspension or revocation of 
        the approved status of an approved guarantor under this section 
        shall have no effect on the status as a covered security of any 
        covered security collateralized by eligible mortgage loans with 
        which the approved guarantor contracted prior to the suspension 
        or revocation.
            (3) Publication.--The Corporation shall--
                    (A) promptly publish a notice in the Federal 
                Register upon suspension or revocation of the approval 
                of any approved guarantor; and
                    (B) maintain an updated list of such approved 
                guarantors on the website of the Corporation.
            (4) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``violate'' 
        includes any action, taken alone or with others, for or toward 
        causing, bringing about, participating in, counseling, or 
        aiding or abetting, a violation of the requirements under this 
        Act.
    (d) Prudential Standards for Supervision.--The Corporation shall 
prescribe prudential standards for approved guarantors in order to--
            (1) ensure--
                    (A) the safety and soundness of approved 
                guarantors; and
                    (B) the maintenance of approval standards by 
                approved guarantors; and
            (2) minimize the risk presented to the Mortgage Insurance 
        Fund.
    (e) Reports and Examinations.--For purposes of determining whether 
an approved guarantor is fulfilling the requirements under this Act, 
the Corporation shall have the authority to require reports from and 
examine an approved guarantor, in the same manner and to the same 
extent as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has with respect to 
an insured depository institution under the provisions of subsection 
(a) of section 9 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1819).
    (f) Enforcement.--The Corporation shall have the authority to 
enforce the provisions of this Act with respect to an approved 
guarantor, in the same manner and to the same extent as the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation has with respect to an insured depository 
institution under the provisions of subsections (b) through (n) of 
section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818).
    (g) Capital Standards.--
            (1) In general.--Pursuant to the requirement to establish 
        capital and related solvency standards under section 309(b), 
        the Corporation shall establish standards for approved 
        guarantors that require an approved guarantor to--
                    (A) hold 10 percent capital; and
                    (B) maintain solvency levels adequate for the 
                approved guarantor to withstand losses that might be 
                incurred by the approved guarantor in a period of 
                economic stress, including national and regional home 
                price declines, such as those observed during moderate 
                to severe recessions in the United States.
            (2) Risk-sharing considerations.--For purposes of paragraph 
        (1), the Corporation shall consider the extent, amount, and 
        form of risk-sharing and risk mitigation through the use by 
        approved guarantors of credit risk-sharing mechanisms approved 
        pursuant to section 302(b)(4). The Corporation shall allow such 
        risk-sharing and risk mitigation to fulfill required amounts of 
        capital to be held under paragraph (1)(A) such that it ensures 
        an equivalent amount of loss absorption capacity as required 
        under section 302(a)(1)(B) while maintaining an appropriate 
        structure of capital as determined by the Corporation.
            (3) Stress tests.--The Corporation shall conduct 
        appropriate stress tests of each approved guarantor that has 
        total assets of more than $10,000,000,000, provided that such 
        stress tests shall be--
                    (A) specifically tailored to the business model of 
                the approved guarantor; and
                    (B) utilized to--
                            (i) ensure the safety and soundness of the 
                        approved guarantor; and
                            (ii) minimize the risk the approved 
                        guarantor may present to the Mortgage Insurance 
                        Fund.
    (h) Resolution Authority for Failing Guarantors.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        Federal law, the law of any State, or the constitution of any 
        State, the Corporation shall--
                    (A) have the authority to act, in the same manner 
                and to the same extent, with respect to an approved 
                guarantor as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
                has with respect to an insured depository institution 
                under subsections (c) through (s) of section 11 of the 
                Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1821), section 
                12 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 
                1822), and section 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Act (12 U.S.C. 1823), while tailoring such actions to 
                the specific business model of the approved guarantor, 
                as may be necessary to properly exercise such authority 
                under this subsection;
                    (B) in carrying out any authority provided in 
                subparagraph (A), act, in the same manner and to the 
                same extent, with respect to the Mortgage Insurance 
                Fund as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may 
                act with respect to the Deposit Insurance Fund under 
                the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act set 
                forth in subparagraph (A);
                    (C) prescribe regulations governing the applicable 
                rights, duties, and obligations of an approved 
                guarantor placed into resolution under this subsection, 
                its creditors, counterparties, and other persons, as 
                the Corporation deems necessary to properly exercise 
                the authority provided in subparagraph (A);
                    (D) consistent with the authorities provided in 
                subparagraph (A), immediately place an insolvent 
                approved guarantor into receivership; and
                    (E) upon placing an approved guarantor into 
                receivership, treat single-family covered securities 
                insured by the Corporation under section 303 in the 
                same manner as the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Corporation treats deposit liabilities under section 
                11(d)(11)(A)(ii) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
                and insured deposits under section 11(f) of the Federal 
                Deposit Insurance Act, where the Corporation shall have 
                the same right of subrogation as the Federal Deposit 
                Insurance Corporation has under section 11(g) of the 
                Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
            (2) Least-cost resolution required.--The Corporation may 
        not exercise any authority under paragraph (1) with respect to 
        any approved guarantor unless the total amount of the 
        expenditures by the Corporation and obligations incurred by the 
        Corporation in connection with the exercise of any such 
        authority with respect to such approved guarantor is the least 
        costly to the Mortgage Insurance Fund, consistent with the 
        least cost approach specified in the Federal Deposit Insurance 
        Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.), of all possible methods for 
        meeting the Corporation's obligations under this Act and 
        expeditiously concluding its resolution activities, subject to 
        section 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act where the 
        Corporation and the Board of Directors shall have the same 
        authority as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the 
        Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's board of directors.
            (3) Taxpayer protection.--The Corporation, in carrying out 
        any authority provided in this subsection, shall prescribe 
        regulations to ensure that any amounts owed to the United 
        States, unless the United States agrees or consents otherwise, 
        shall have priority following administrative expenses of the 
        receiver when satisfying unsecured claims against an approved 
        guarantor, or the receiver therefor, that are proven to the 
        satisfaction of the receiver.
    (i) Hearing.--Upon notice of denial of an application for approval 
under subsection (b) or upon a notice of suspension or revocation of 
the approved status of an approved guarantor under subsection (c), the 
applicant or approved guarantor shall be afforded a hearing under 
subsection (h) of section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 
U.S.C. 1818(h)), in the same manner and to the same extent as if the 
Corporation were the appropriate Federal banking agency, provided that 
the approved guarantor submits a request to the Corporation for a 
hearing not later than 10 days after the date on which the notice is 
published under subsection (b)(3) or (c)(3).
    (j) Other Activities.--An approved guarantor shall be prohibited 
from being an approved aggregator.
    (k) Provision of Pool Level Insurance.--Subject to such standards 
as the Corporation may provide, an approved guarantor may provide 
insurance or other credit enhancement on a pool of eligible single-
family mortgage loans collateralizing a single-family covered security 
insured under this title.
    (l) Prohibited Activity.--An approved guarantor may not--
            (1) originate eligible single-family mortgage loans; or
            (2) be an affiliate of a person that actively engages in 
        the business of originating eligible single-family mortgage 
        loans.
    (m) Guarantors Required to Pay Claims.--Subject to such standards 
as the Corporation may provide, an approved guarantor may not for any 
reason withhold payment of funds that would ensure holders of single-
family covered securities receive timely payment of principal and 
interest on single-family covered securities. The Corporation shall by 
regulation develop a process for the mediation and resolution of 
disputed payment amounts.

SEC. 312. APPROVAL AND SUPERVISION OF AGGREGATORS.

            (1) In general.--The Corporation shall develop, adopt, and

        mortgage aggregators to deliver eligible single-family mortgage 
        loans to the Securitization Platform for securitization by such 
        aggregator as a single-family covered security.
            (2) Required standards.--The standards required under 
        paragraph (1) shall include standards with respect to the 
        ability of mortgage aggregator to--

                into pools, including multi-lender pools, as 
                appropriate;
                    (B) transfer investment risk and credit risk to 
                private market participants in accordance with the 
                credit risk-sharing mechanisms approved by the 
                Corporation under section 302;
                    (C) ensure equitable access to the secondary 
                mortgage market for single-family covered securities 
                for all institutions regardless of size or geographic 
                location; and
                    (D) ensure that eligible single-family mortgage 
                loans that collateralize a single-family covered 
                security insured under this title are originated in 
                compliance with the requirements of this Act.
            (3) Additional required standards.--The standards required 
        under paragraph (1) shall also include--

                    (C) the capability of the management of the 
                mortgage aggregator;
                    (D) the general character and fitness of the 
                officers and directors of the mortgage aggregator, 
                including the compliance history of the mortgage 
                aggregator's officers and directors with Federal and 
                State laws and the rules and regulations promulgated by 
                self-regulatory organizations (as defined in section 
                3(a)(26) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
                U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)), as applicable;
                    (E) the risk presented by the mortgage aggregator 
                to the Mortgage Insurance Fund;
                    (F) the adequacy of insurance and fidelity coverage 
                of the mortgage aggregator;

                purposes of the Corporation described in section 
                201(b)(5);
                    (I) that the mortgage aggregator is in compliance 
                with section 210(a)(3); and
                    (J) any other standard the Corporation determines 
                necessary to protect the Mortgage Insurance Fund.
            (4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in subparagraph (H) of 
        paragraph (3) shall be construed to prevent the Corporation 
        from approving a small or specialty mortgage aggregator,

        adequately diversify its risk to meet appropriate safety and 
        soundness concerns of the Corporation.
            (5) Consultation and coordination.--To promote consistency

            (1) Application process.--
                    (A) In general.--The Corporation shall establish an 
                application process, in such form and manner and 
                requiring such information as the Corporation may 
                require, for the approval of a mortgage aggregator 
                under this section.
                    (B) Application review.--The Corporation shall 
                establish internal timelines for its processing of an 
                application under this section, including timelines for 
                any action to approve or to deny an application under 
                this section.
            (2) Approval.--The Corporation may approve any application 
        made pursuant to paragraph (1), provided the mortgage 
        aggregator meets the standards established under subsection 
        (a).
            (3) Denial.--The Corporation shall have the authority to 
        deny any application made pursuant to paragraph (1) if an 
        officer or director of the mortgage aggregator has, at any time 
        prior to the date of the approval of such application, been--
                    (A) subject to a statutory disqualification 
                pursuant to section 3(a)(39) of the Securities Exchange 
                Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)); or

                participation pursuant to section 8(g) of the Federal 
                Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(g)), prohibited 
                from certain action pursuant to paragraphs (6) or (7) 
                of section 8(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
                (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)), subject to an action resulting in 
                a written agreement or other written statement under 
                section 8(u)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
                (12 U.S.C. 1818(u)(1)), for which a violation may be 
                enforced by an appropriate Federal banking agency, or 
                subject to any final order issued with respect to any 
                administrative enforcement proceeding initiated by such 
                agency under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Act (12 U.S.C. 1818).
            (4) Notice and publication.--The Corporation shall--
                    (A) provide prompt notice to a mortgage aggregator 
                of the approval or denial of any application of the 
                mortgage aggregator to become an approved aggregator 
                under this section;
                    (B) publish a notice in the Federal Register upon 
                approval of any mortgage aggregator; and
                    (C) maintain an updated list of approved 
                aggregators on the website of the Corporation.
    (c) Requirement to Maintain Approval Status.--
            (1) Authority to issue order.--If the Corporation 
        determines that an approved aggregator no longer meets the 
        standards for such approval or violates a requirement under 
        this Act, including any standard, regulation, or order 
        promulgated in accordance with this Act, the Corporation may--
                    (A) suspend or revoke the approved status of the 
                approved aggregator; or
                    (B) take any other action with respect to such 
                approved aggregator as may be authorized under this 
                Act.
            (2) Rule of construction.--The suspension or revocation of 
        the approved status of an approved aggregator under this 
        section shall have no effect on the status as a covered 
        security of any covered security collateralized by eligible 
        mortgage loans with which the approved aggregator contracted 
        prior to the suspension or revocation.
            (3) Publication.--The Corporation shall--
                    (A) promptly publish a notice in the Federal 
                Register upon suspension or revocation of the approval

                    (B) maintain an updated list of such approved 
                aggregators on the website of the Corporation.
            (4) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``violate'' 
        includes any action, taken alone or with others, for or toward 
        causing, bringing about, participating in, counseling, or 
        aiding or abetting, a violation of the requirements under this 
        Act.
    (d) Prudential Standards for Supervision.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (k)(1), the 
        Corporation shall prescribe prudential standards for approved 
        aggregators in order to--
                    (A) ensure--
                            (i) the safety and soundness of approved 
                        aggregators; and
                            (ii) the maintenance of approval standards 
                        by approved aggregators; and
                    (B) minimize the risk presented to the Mortgage 
                Insurance Fund.
            (2) Recognition of distinctions between aggregators that 
        are insured depository institutions, affiliates of insured 
        depository institutions, and those that are not.--In carrying 
        out the requirements under paragraph (1), the Corporation 
        shall--
                    (A) distinguish between prudential standards for 
                approved aggregators that are insured depository 
                institutions, approved aggregators that are affiliates 
                of insured depository institutions, and approved 
                aggregators that are neither insured depository 
                institutions nor affiliates of insured depository 
                institutions; and
                    (B) consult and coordinate with Federal and State 
                banking agencies when establishing prudential standards 
                for approved aggregators that are insured depository 
                institutions and approved aggregators that are 
                affiliates of insured depository institutions, in order 
                to minimize duplication of and conflicts with the 
                prudential standards set by the appropriate Federal or 
                State banking agencies of insured depository 
                institutions or the affiliates of insured depository 
                institutions.
            (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
        supersede the prudential standards established by the 
        appropriate Federal banking agencies.
    (e) Reports and Examinations.--For purposes of gathering 
information to determine whether an approved aggregator is fulfilling 
the requirements under this Act, the Corporation shall have the 
authority to require reports from and examine an approved aggregator as 
follows:
            (1) Not insured depository institutions or affiliates.--For 
        an approved aggregator that is neither an insured depository 
        institution nor an affiliate of an insured depository 
        institution, the Corporation shall have the authority to 
        require reports from and examine an approved aggregator, in the 
        same manner and to the same extent as the Federal Deposit 
        Insurance Corporation has with respect to an insured depository 
        institution under the provisions of subsection (a) of section 9 
        of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1819).
            (2) Insured depository institutions and affiliates.--For an 
        approved aggregator that is an insured depository institution 
        or an affiliate of an insured depository institutions:
                    (A) Use of existing reports to reduce 
                examinations.--To the fullest extent possible, the 
                Corporation shall--
                            (i) rely on the examinations, inspections, 
                        and reports of the appropriate Federal or State 
                        banking agencies;
                            (ii) avoid duplication of examination 
                        activities, reporting requirements, and 
                        requests for information; and
                            (iii) ensure that the depository 
                        institution holding company and the 
                        subsidiaries of the depository institution 
                        holding company are not subject to conflicting 
                        supervisory demands by the Corporation and 
                        appropriate Federal and State banking agencies.
                    (B) Examination authority.--If the Corporation 
                determines that the examinations, inspections, and 
                reports obtained pursuant to subparagraph (A) are 
                insufficient for the Corporation to adequately 
                supervise an approved aggregator for compliance with 
                this Act, the Corporation shall have the authority to 
                require reports from and examine the approved 
                aggregator for compliance with this Act, in the same 
                manner and to the same extent as the Board of Governors 
                of the Federal Reserve System has with respect to a 
                subsidiary of a bank holding companyunder the 
                provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (c) 
                of section 5 of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 
                1844).
                    (C) Regulatory notice.--
                            (i) Regulatory notice.--Before commencing 
                        an examination of an approved aggregator under 
                        this paragraph, the Corporation shall provide 
                        reasonable notice to, and coordinate with, the 
                        appropriate Federal or State banking agency or 
                        State regulatory agency.
                            (ii) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                        Act shall limit the authority of the 
                        Corporation to require reports of and examine 
                        an approved aggregator--
                                    (I) to verify the sale of, and 
                                funds received from, the first loss 
                                position; and
                                    (II) when the Corporation becomes 
                                aware--
                                            (aa) of a material threat 
                                        to the safety and soundness of 
                                        the approved aggregator;
                                            (bb) that the approved 
                                        aggregator is in material 
                                        violation of this Act or the 
                                        rules promulgated by the 
                                        Corporation pursuant to this 
                                        Act; or
                                            (cc) that the activities of 
                                        the approved aggregator 
                                        threaten the financial 
                                        stability of the housing 
                                        finance system or the Mortgage 
                                        Insurance Fund.
    (f) Enforcement.--The Corporation shall have the authority to 
enforce the provisions of this Act with respect to an approved 
aggregator, in the same manner and to the same extent as the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation has with respect to an insured depository 
institution under the provisions of subsections (b) through (n) of 
section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818), 
provided that to the extent that the Corporation and an appropriate 
Federal banking agency are each authorized to enforce prudential 
standards with respect to an approved aggregator that is an insured 
depository institution or an affiliate of an insured depository 
institution, the appropriate Federal banking agency shall have primary 
authority to enforce such standards.
    (g) Capital Standards.--For approved aggregators that are neither 
an insured depository institution nor an affiliate of an insured 
depository institution the following shall apply:
            (1) In general.--Pursuant to the requirement to establish 
        capital and related solvency standards under section 309(b), 
        the Corporation shall establish standards for approved 
        aggregators that require an approved aggregator--
                    (A) to hold capital in an amount comparable to that 
                which is required to be held by insured depository 
                institutions and their affiliates with respect to their 
                applicable aggregating activities; and
                    (B) to maintain solvency levels adequate for the 
                approved aggregator to withstand losses that might be 
                incurred by the approved aggregator in a period of 
                economic stress, including national and regional home 
                price declines, such as those observed during moderate 
                to severe recessions in the United States.
            (2) Stress tests.--The Corporation shall conduct 
        appropriate stress tests of each approved aggregator that has 
        total assets of more than $10,000,000,000, provided that such 
        stress tests shall be--
                    (A) specifically tailored to the business model of 
                the approved aggregator;
                    (B) utilized to--
                            (i) ensure the safety and soundness of the 
                        approved aggregator; and
                            (ii) minimize the risk the approved 
                        aggregator may present to the Mortgage 
                        Insurance Fund; and
                    (C) coordinated with the Board of Governors of the 
                Federal Reserve System, if the approved aggregator is 
                an affiliate of an insured depository institution.
    (h) Resolution Authority for Failing Aggregators.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        Federal law, the law of any State, or the constitution of any 
        State, the Corporation shall--
                    (A) have the authority to act, in the same manner 
                and to the same extent, with respect to an approved 
                aggregator that is not an insured depository 
                institution as the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Corporation has with respect to an insured depository 
                institution under subsections (c) through (s) of 
                section 11 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 
                U.S.C. 1821), section 12 of the Federal Deposit 
                Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1822), and section 13 of the 
                Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1823), while 
                tailoring such actions to the specific business model 
                of the approved aggregator, as may be necessary to 
                properly exercise such authority under this subsection;
                    (B) in carrying out any authority provided under 
                subparagraph (A), act, in the same manner and to the 
                same extent, with respect to the Mortgage Insurance 
                Fund as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may 
                act with respect to the Deposit Insurance Fund under 
                the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act set 
                forth in subparagraph (A);
                    (C) prescribe regulations governing the applicable 
                rights, duties, and obligations of an approved 
                aggregator that is not an insured depository 
                institution placed into resolution under this 
                subsection, its creditors, counterparties, and other 
                persons, as the Corporation deems necessary to properly 
                exercise the authority provided in subparagraph (A); 
                and
                    (D) consistent with the authorities provided in 
                subparagraph (A), immediately place an insolvent 
                approved aggregator that is not an insured depository 
                institution into receivership.
            (2) Rule of construction.--If an insolvent approved 
        aggregator is an insured depository institution, the 
        Corporation shall recommend, in writing, to such approved 
        aggregator's appropriate Federal banking agency or State 
        banking regulator to resolve such approved aggregator, which 
        agency shall have sole authority to resolve such aggregator 
        pursuant to section 11(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
        (12 U.S.C. 1821(c)) and other appropriate sections of the 
        Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.) or 
        appropriate Federal or State law, as applicable.
            (3) Least-cost resolution required.--The Corporation may 
        not exercise any authority under paragraph (1) with respect to 
        any approved aggregator that is not an insured depository 
        institution unless the total amount of the expenditures by the 
        Corporation and obligations incurred by the Corporation in 
        connection with the exercise of any such authority with respect 
        to such approved aggregator is the least costly to the Mortgage 
        Insurance Fund, consistent with the least cost approach 
        specified in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 
        et seq.), of all possible methods for meeting the Corporation's 
        obligations under this Act and expeditiously concluding its 
        resolution activities, subject to section 13 of the Federal 
        Deposit Insurance Act where the Corporation and the Board of 
        Directors shall have the same authority as the Federal Deposit 
        Insurance Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance 
        Corporation's board of directors.
            (4) Taxpayer protection.--The Corporation, in carrying out 
        any authority provided in this subsection, shall prescribe 
        regulations to ensure that any amounts owed to the United 
        States, unless the United States agrees or consents otherwise, 
        shall have priority following administrative expenses of the 
        receiver when satisfying unsecured claims against an approved 
        aggregator, or the receiver therefor, that are proven to the 
        satisfaction of the receiver.
    (i) Hearing.--Upon notice of denial of an application for approval 
under subsection (b) or upon a notice of suspension or revocation of 
the approved status of an approved aggregator under subsection (c), the 
applicant or approved aggregator shall be afforded a hearing under 
subsection (h) of section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 
U.S.C. 1818(h)), in the same manner and to the same extent as if the 
Corporation were the appropriate Federal banking agency, provided that 
the approved aggregator submits a request to the Corporation for a 
hearing not later than 10 days after the date on which the notice is 
published under subsection (b)(3) or (c)(3).
    (j) Other Activities.--An approved aggregator shall be prohibited 
from being an approved guarantor.
    (k) Information Sharing Regarding Insured Depository Institutions 
and Affiliates of Insured Depository Institutions.--
            (1) By the corporation.--To the extent the Corporation has 
        relevant information indicating that an approved aggregator 
        that is an insured depository institution or an affiliate of an 
        insured depository institution (A) faces a material threat to 
        its safety and soundness, including insufficient capital, (B) 
        may be in material violation of Federal banking law, or (C) may 
        threaten the financial stability of the housing finance system 
        or the Mortgage Insurance Fund, the Corporation shall notify, 
        in writing, such appropriate Federal banking agency that such 
        conditions exist. The Corporation shall have no authority to 
        enforce prudential standards established by an appropriate 
        Federal banking agency pursuant to the appropriate Federal 
        banking agency's authority.
            (2) By federal and state banking agencies.--To the extent 
        an appropriate Federal banking agency or State banking agency 
        has relevant information indicating that an approved aggregator 
        that is an insured depository institution or an affiliate of an 
        insured depository institution (A) faces a material threat to 
        its safety and soundness, including insufficient capital, (B) 
        may be in material violation of this Act or the rules 
        promulgated by the Corporation pursuant to this Act, or (C) may 
        threaten the financial stability of the housing finance system 
        or the Mortgage Insurance Fund, such appropriate Federal 
        banking agency or State banking agency shall notify, in 
        writing, the Corporation that such conditions exist.
    (l) Rule of Construction Regarding Preservation of Corporation 
Authority.--Nothing in this section limits, or shall be construed to 
limit, the authority of the Corporation to provide exemptions to, or 
adjustments for, the provisions of this section based on the asset size 
of an approved aggregator, or other criteria, as the Corporation deems 
appropriate, in order to reduce regulatory burdens while appropriately 
balancing protection of the Mortgage Insurance Fund.

                        Home Loan Bank Act (12 U.S.C. 1432) is amended

        collateralize single-family covered securities.
            (2) Required standards.--The standards required under 
        paragraph (1) shall include--

                officers and directors of the private mortgage insurer, 
                including the compliance history of the private 
                mortgage insurer's officers and directors with Federal 
                and State laws and the rules and regulations 
                promulgated by self-regulatory organizations (as

                under this section.
                    (B) Application review.--The Corporation shall 
                establish internal timelines for its processing of an

                any action to approve or to deny an application under 
                this section.
                    (C) Notification.--The Corporation shall notify the 
                appropriate State insurance regulator upon receipt of 
                any application by a private mortgage insurer to become

                Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)); or
                    (B) suspended, removed, or prohibited from 
                participation pursuant to section 8(g) of the Federal 
                Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(g)), prohibited

                (12 U.S.C. 1818(u)(1)), for which a violation may be 
                enforced by an appropriate Federal banking agency, or

                administrative enforcement proceeding initiated by such 
                agency under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Act (12 U.S.C. 1818).
            (4) Notice and publication.--The Corporation shall--
                    (A) provide prompt notice to a private mortgage 
                insurer of the approval or denial of any application of 
                the private mortgage insurer to become an approved 
                private mortgage insurer under this section;
                    (B) publish a notice in the Federal Register upon 
                approval of any private mortgage insurer;

                insurance regulator upon the approval or denial of any 
                application of a private mortgage insurer to become an 
                approved private mortgage insurer under this section.
            (5) Grandfathered insurers of the enterprises.--Any private 
        mortgage insurer who was approved to insure mortgage loans for 
        an enterprise on the date that is 1 day before the date the 
        Corporation publishes the provisional standards for the 
        approval of private mortgage insurers required under section 
        607(a)(2), and was in good standing as of such date--
                    (A) shall be deemed conditionally approved for a 
                period of 1 year from the date on which the Corporation 
                publishes the provisional standards for the approval of 
                private mortgage insurers required under section 
                607(a)(2);
                    (B) shall, not later than the date which is 6 
                months after date on which the Corporation publishes 
                the standards required under subsection (a), apply for 
                approved status via the application process described 
                in this subsection to be eligible for approved status; 
                and
                    (C) shall, provided the private mortgage insurer 
                has complied with subparagraph (B), receive a 
                determination from the Corporation as to the approval 
                or denial of its application to become an approved 
                private mortgage insurer prior to the expiration of the 
                1-year period described under subparagraph (A).
    (c) Requirement to Maintain Approval Status.--
            (1) Authority to issue order.--If the Corporation

        meets the standards for such approval or violates a requirement 
        under this section, including any standard, regulation, or 
        order promulgated in accordance with this Act, the Corporation 
        may--
                    (A) provide prompt notice to the appropriate State 
                insurance regulator that the Corporation determines 
                that an approved private mortgage insurer no longer 
                meets the standard for such approval;
                    (B) suspend or revoke the approved status of the 
                approved private mortgage insurer; or
                    (C) take any other action with respect to such 
                approved private mortgage insurer as may be authorized 
                under this Act.
            (2) Rule of construction.--The suspension or revocation of 
        the approved status of an approved private mortgage insurer 
        under this section shall have no effect on the status as a 
        covered security of any covered security collateralized by 
        eligible mortgage loans with which the approved private 
        mortgage insurer contracted prior to the suspension or 
        revocation.
            (3) Publication.--The Corporation shall--
                    (A) promptly publish a notice in the Federal 
                Register upon suspension or revocation of the approval 
                of any approved private mortgage insurer; and
                    (B) maintain an updated list of such approved 
                private mortgage insurers on the website of the 
                Corporation.

        includes any action, taken alone or with others, for or toward 
        causing, bringing about, participating in, counseling, or 
        aiding or abetting, a violation of the requirements under this 
        Act.
    (d) State Regulation.--The appropriate State insurance regulator of 
an approved private mortgage insurer has primary authority to examine 
and supervise the approved private mortgage insurer.
    (e) Reports and Examinations.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of determining whether an 
        approved private mortgage insurer is fulfilling the 
        requirements under this Act, the Corporation may, in 
        coordination with the appropriate State insurance regulator of 
        the approved private mortgage insurer, including providing the 
        appropriate State insurance regulator the opportunity to join 
        the Corporation in an on-site examination, examine or review 
        any approved private mortgage insurer if the Corporation has 
        substantial reason to believe--
                    (A) that an approved private mortgage insurer has 
                engaged in a material violation or pattern of 
                violations of this Act or the rules promulgated 
                pursuant to this Act; or
                    (B) that the activities of an approved private 
                mortgage insurer may threaten the financial stability 
                of the housing finance system or the Mortgage Insurance 
                Fund.
            (2) 3-year compliance examination.--In addition to the 
        authority under paragraph (1), the Corporation shall conduct an 
        examination of an approved private mortgage insurer once, but 
        not more than once, every 3 years, provided the approved

        appropriate State insurance regulator.
            (3) Coordination.--In conducting an exam or review

                with, the appropriate State insurance regulator for an 
                approved private mortgage insurer before commencing an 
                examination of the approved private mortgage insurer 
                under this section;
                    (B) to the fullest extent possible, avoid 
                duplication of examination activities, reporting 
                requirements, and requests for information, including 
                by relying on existing examinations, inspections, and 
                reports of the appropriate State insurance regulator; 
                and
                    (C) ensure that the approved private mortgage 
                insurer is not subject to conflicting supervisory 
                demands by the Corporation and State insurance 
                regulators, as appropriate.
            (4) Notice of determination.--The State insurance regulator 
        of an approved private mortgage insurer shall notify the 
        Corporation if there has been a final determination that the 
        approved private mortgage insurer is in a hazardous financial 
        condition provided that the Corporation agrees to maintain the 
        confidentiality or privileged status of the document, material, 
        or other information received from the State insurance 
        regulator of the approved private mortgage insurer.
    (f) Enforcement.--
            (1) In general.--The Corporation shall have the authority 
        to enforce the provisions of this section with respect to a 
        private mortgage insurer, in the same manner and to the same 
        extent as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has with 
        respect to an insured depository institution under the 
        provisions of subsections (b) through (n) of section 8 of the 
        Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818), provided the 
        Corporation demonstrates that such enforcement action is 
        necessary to avoid significant risk to the Mortgage Insurance 
        Fund.
            (2) Notification.--Prior to taking any enforcement action 
        against an approved private mortgage insurer, the Corporation 
        shall promptly notify, consult, and coordinate with the 
        appropriate State insurance regulator.
    (g) Resolution Authority.--
            (1) In general.--For any approved private mortgage insurer 
        that the Corporation has substantial reason to believe is 
        insolvent, as defined by applicable State law, and would 
        otherwise be subject to receivership proceedings under such 
        applicable State law, the Corporation shall recommend, in 
        writing, that the State insurance regulator for such approved 
        private mortgage insurer take such actions as are necessary and 
        authorized under applicable State law to resolve such approved 
        private mortgage insurer.
            (2) Backup authority.--Notwithstanding the requirement 
        under paragraph (1), if, after the end of the 60-day period 
        beginning on the date on which the Corporation provides its 
        written recommendation pursuant to paragraph (1), the 
        appropriate State insurance regulator has not filed the 
        appropriate judicial action in the appropriate State court to 
        place such approved private mortgage insurer into receivership 
        under the laws and requirements of the State, the Corporation 
        shall have the authority to stand in the place of the 
        appropriate regulatory agency and file the appropriate judicial 
        action in the appropriate State court to place such approved 
        private mortgage insurer into receivership under the laws and 
        requirements of the State.
    (h) Hearing.--Upon notice of denial of an application for approval 
under subsection (b) or upon a notice of suspension or revocation of 
the approved status of an approved private mortgage insurer under 
subsection (c), the applicant or approved private mortgage insurer 
shall be afforded a hearing under subsection (h) of section 8 of the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(h)), in the same manner 
and to the same extent as if the Corporation were the appropriate 
Federal banking agency, provided that the approved private mortgage 
insurer submits a request to the Corporation for a hearing not later 
than 10 days after the date on which the notice is published under 
subsection (b)(3) or (c)(3).
    (i) Rule of Construction Regarding Preservation of Corporation 
Authority.--Nothing in this section limits, or shall be construed to 
limit, the authority of the Corporation to provide exemptions to, or 
adjustments for, the provisions of this section based on the asset size 
of approved private mortgage insurers, or other criteria, as the 
Corporation deems appropriate, in order to reduce regulatory burdens 
while appropriately balancing the protection of the Mortgage Insurance 
Fund.

        collateralizing a single-family covered security insured by the 
        Corporation under this title and in accordance with rules 
        promulgated by the Corporation, the Corporation may require the

                Corporation under this subsection;
                    (B) require that the performance condition 
                warranting or necessitating the use of such authority 
                be of such type or character so as to materially and 
                adversely affect the ability of the Corporation to 
                recover any amounts owed to the Corporation;
                    (C) for purposes of subparagraph (B), define the

                provided a reasonable amount of time, provided that 
                such time does not present a risk to the Mortgage 
                Insurance Fund, to rebut, address, or correct any 
                determination of the Corporation regarding a 
                performance condition described under subparagraph (A);

                    (F) limit the scope of any such authority to 
                eligible single-family mortgage loans that share 
                similar underwriting, borrower, and performance 
                characteristics;
                    (G) ensure that the scope of any such authority is 
                not applied broadly and without further limitation; and
                    (H) notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) through (G), 
                provide that an approved servicer may be subject to 
                more extensive programmatic discipline or correction 
                measures, as determined by the Corporation, if, during 
                any 5-year period--
                            (i) the servicing duties that are the 
                        subject of the current use of the Corporation's 
                        authority under this subsection marks the third 
                        instance of the use of such authority with 
                        respect to the same approved servicer; and
                            (ii) with respect to the prior 2 separate 
                        and individual instances of the use of such 
                        authority, the same approved servicer failed to 
                        cure any identified performance conditions or 
                        implement corrective measures as determined by 
                        the Corporation pursuant to subparagraph (D).
            (3) Cessation of compensation.--If a transfer of servicing 
        duties occurs under paragraph (1), the approved servicer from 
        whom such servicing duties are extinguished shall cease to 
        receive compensation for any such servicing activities related 
        to those duties.

                        approved servicer if the performance of the 
                        eligible single-family mortgage loan pool 
                        serviced by such approved servicer deteriorates 
                        to specified levels; and
                            (ii) a plan to achieve continuity of 
                        contact for borrowers upon the replacement of 
                        the approved servicer.
                    (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed as authorizing the 
                Corporation to circumvent, evade, or otherwise 
                disregard the rules established in paragraphs (1) and 
                (2) when facilitating a transfer of servicing rights.
    (f) Petitions for Change of Servicer by Private Market Holders.--
            (1) Development of process.--The Corporation shall develop 
        a process by which private market holders of the first loss

        Corporation for a change in approved servicers, including 
        specialized servicers for individual eligible single-family 
        mortgage loans, if the private market holders can demonstrate 
        that its investment was not appropriately protected by the 
        current approved servicer, including by failing to meet any 
        standard or requirement identified under paragraphs (1) and (2) 
        of subsection (a).
            (2) Cessation of compensation.--If a change in approved 
        servicers is approved under paragraph (1)--
                    (A) the change must occur within 30 days after the 
                petition is approved by the Corporation; and
                    (B) once the change required under subparagraph (A) 
                has occurred, the approved servicer from whom such 
                servicing rights are extinguished shall cease to 
                receive compensation for any such servicing activities 
                related to those rights.
    (g) Notice of Transfer of Servicing Rights by Current Servicer.--
            (1) Notice to fmic.--The Corporation shall develop a 
        process by which an approved servicer shall provide notice to 
        the Corporation of any transfer of any servicing rights of such 
        approved servicer to another approved servicer.
            (2) Authority of fmic to prevent, halt, or rescind a 
        transfer.--The process required to be developed under paragraph 
        (1) shall include the development of procedures to permit the 
        Corporation to prevent, halt, or rescind any transfer of 
        servicing rights from an approved servicer to a servicer that 
        is not approved to service eligible single-family mortgage 
        loans under this section or to any servicer whose approved 
        status has been suspended or revoked pursuant to subsection 
        (c)(2).
    (h) General Authority With Respect to the Transfer of Servicing 
Rights.--The Corporation may develop such other standards with respect 
to the transfer of servicing rights by approved servicers as the 
Corporation determines necessary and appropriate to facilitate an 
orderly transfer of servicing rights after the suspension or revocation

            (1) In general.--The Corporation shall carry out a study of

        mortgage loans, including alternatives to existing servicing 
        compensation structures.
            (2) Recommendations.--The study required under paragraph 
        (1) shall include recommendations for the optimal structure of 
        servicer compensation, in order to--
                    (A) improve service for borrowers;
                    (B) reduce financial risk to servicers; and
                    (C) provide flexibility for guarantors to better 
                manage non-performing single-family mortgage loans.
            (3) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of

        the Congress containing any findings and determinations made in 
        carrying out the study required under paragraph (1).
    (j) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall prohibit a 
mortgage originator from retaining rights to service the eligible 
single-family mortgage loans it originated, provided that the mortgage 
originator--
            (1) meets the standards to be an approved servicer under 
        subsection (a); or
            (2) qualifies for an exemption under subsection (b)(5).

                    (B) Adequately capitalized.--A covered entity shall

                solvency standards required under section 309(b).
                    (C) Undercapitalized.--A covered entity shall be 
                classified as undercapitalized if the entity fails to 
                meet any of the capital and solvency standards required 
                under section 309(b).
                    (D) Significantly undercapitalized.--A covered 
                entity shall be classified as significantly 
                undercapitalized if the entity is significantly below

            (3) Discretionary classification.--
                    (A) Grounds for reclassification.--The Corporation 
                may reclassify the capital classification of a covered 
                entity if--
                            (i) at any time, the Corporation 
                        determines, in writing, that the covered entity 
                        is engaging in conduct that could result in a 
                        rapid depletion of capital held by the covered 
                        entity;
                            (ii) after notice and an opportunity for 
                        hearing, the Corporation determines that the 
                        covered entity is in an unsafe or unsound 
                        condition;
                            (iii) pursuant to the requirements of this 
                        title, the Corporation deems the covered entity 
                        to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound 
                        practice;
                            (iv) the covered entity does not submit a 
                        capital restoration plan within the applicable 
                        time period that is substantially in compliance 
                        with regulations for such plans adopted by the 
                        Corporation;
                            (v) the Corporation does not approve the 
                        capital restoration plan submitted by the 
                        covered entity; or
                            (vi) the Corporation determines that the 
                        covered entity has failed to comply with the 
                        capital restoration plan and fulfill the 
                        schedule for the plan approved by the 
                        Corporation in any material respect.
                    (B) Reclassification.--In addition to any other 
                action authorized under this title, including the 
                reclassification of a covered entity for any reason not 
                specified in this subsection, if the Corporation takes 
                any action described in subparagraph (A), the 
                Corporation may classify a covered entity as 
                appropriate.
            (4) Restriction on capital distributions.--
                    (A) In general.--A covered entity shall make no 
                capital distribution if, after making the distribution, 
                the covered entity would be classified as anything 
                other than well capitalized or adequately capitalized.
                    (B) Exception.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), 
                the Corporation may permit a covered entity, to the 
                extent appropriate or applicable, to repurchase, 
                redeem, retire, or otherwise acquire shares or 
                ownership interests if the repurchase, redemption, 
                retirement, or other acquisition--
                            (i) is made in connection with the issuance 
                        of additional shares or obligations of the 
                        covered entity in at least an equivalent 
                        amount;
                            (ii) will reduce the financial obligations 
                        of the covered entity or otherwise improve the 
                        financial condition of the covered entity;
                            (iii) will enhance the ability of the 
                        covered entity to promptly meet the minimum 
                        capital level for the covered entity;
                            (iv) contributes to the long-term financial 
                        safety and soundness of the covered entity; or

                    (B) any increase in total assets is consistent with 
                the capital restoration plan; and

                covered entity increases during the calendar quarter at

                plan, restrictions, and requirements applicable to an

        regulatory organizations (as defined in section 3(a)(26) of the 
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26)), as 
        applicable;
            (5) the risk presented by such acquisition, merger, 
        consolidation, or divestiture to the Mortgage Insurance Fund;
            (6) any other standard the Corporation determines necessary 
        to promote competition and mitigate market dislocations among 
        covered entities in the secondary mortgage market; and

        or appropriate.
    (d) Approval.--The Corporation--

                    (B) any other proposed acquisition or merger or 
                consolidation under this section whose effect in any 
                area of the United States may be substantially to 
                lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly, or 
                which in any other manner would be in restraint of 
                trade, unless the Corporation finds that the 
                anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are 
                clearly outweighed in the public interest by the 
                probable effect of the transaction in meeting the needs 
                of consumers and the communities served; and
            (3) shall have the authority to deny any application made

                subparagraph (A) occurs as an exchange for value, 
                including through the provision of appropriate 
                compensation to the enterprises (including as provided 
                in subparagraphs (C) and (D)), or other entities 
                responsible for creating, or contracting with, the CSP.
                    (C) Maximum return to senior preferred shareholders 
                of the enterprises.--The transfer or sale of property 
                to the Platform under this paragraph shall, as 
                appropriate, be managed by the Federal Housing Finance

                for the senior preferred shareholders of the 
                enterprises to the extent that such resolutions--
                            (i) are consistent with facilitating--
                                    (I) a deep, liquid, and resilient 
                                secondary mortgage market for single-
                                family and multifamily mortgage-backed 
                                securities to support access to 
                                mortgage credit in the primary mortgage 
                                market; and
                                    (II) an orderly transition from 
                                housing finance markets facilitated by 
                                the enterprises to housing finance 
                                markets facilitated by the Corporation 
                                with minimum disruption in the 
                                availability of loan credit;
                            (ii) are consistent with applicable Federal 
                        and State law;

                        absorb losses incurred in the secondary 
                        mortgage market.
                    (D) Required determinations for sale of assets to 
                the platform.--The Federal Housing Finance Agency may 
                not require the enterprises to make a sale to the 
                Platform under subparagraph (A) that involves the 
                disposition of the property or assets of the 
                enterprises unless the Federal Housing Finance Agency 
                determines that the sale--
                            (i) is consistent with an orderly 
                        transition from housing finance markets 
                        facilitated by the enterprises to efficient 
                        housing finance markets facilitated by the 
                        Corporation with minimum disruption in the 
                        availability of loan credit;
                            (ii) does not impede or otherwise interfere 
                        with the ability of the Federal Housing Finance 
                        Agency or the Corporation to carry out the 
                        functions and requirements of this Act;
                            (iii) does not transfer, convey, or 
                        authorize any guarantee or Federal support, 
                        assistance, or backing, implicit or explicit, 
                        related to any such property or assets being 
                        sold; and
                            (iv) will maximize the return for the 
                        senior preferred shareholders as required under 
                        subparagraph (C).
    (e) Platform Operability.--The Corporation shall establish 
sufficient redundancies in the Platform so that in the event of 
operational disruption of the Platform, there is sufficient back-up 
capacity to--
            (1) process payments on existing securities issued through 
        the Platform; and
            (2) structure, form, and issue new securities through the 
        Platform.
    (f) Use by Other Entities in Exigent Circumstance.--
            (1) In general.--On and after the system certification 
        date, if the Corporation determines that operational or other 
        problems with the Platform do not permit the Platform to 
        operate in a manner that allows the Platform to achieve the 
        purposes and obligations of the Platform under section 325, the 
        Corporation shall have the authority to permit the Platform 
        Directors to use entities other than the Platform to perform 
        the issuance functions required to be performed through the 
        Platform and that are necessary for the proper functioning of 
        the secondary mortgage market.
            (2) Rule of construction.--Any entity permitted to perform 
        issuance functions that would ordinarily be expected to be 
        performed by the Platform under paragraph (1) shall be 
        regulated and supervised, as appropriate, by the Corporation as 
        if such entity were the Platform itself.

                charges for the issuance of noncovered securities that 
                differ from the usage fees charged for the issuance of 
                covered securities.
            (4) Payment.--Usage fees charged under this subsection 
        shall be paid by the member at the time the mortgage loans or

        by the Platform Directors within 60 days following the 
        submission of the proposed initial fee or usage fee structure 
        to the Corporation, the proposed initial fee or usage fee 
        structure shall automatically go into effect for the Platform 
        and its members.
            (3) Impact of corporation disapproval.--If the Corporation 
        disapproves an initial fee or usage fee structure proposed by 
        the Platform Directors pursuant to this subsection, the

                        operational structures and contractual 
                        arrangements; and

Issuance.--The Platform shall be developed in a manner that may permit, 
and would not preclude, the Platform, or any subsidiary or affiliate 
thereof, to be used for the issuance of multifamily loan 
securitizations, provided that the development of this vehicle for 
multifamily loan securitizations does not delay the ability of the 
Platform to perform its obligations under this section with respect to 
single-family securities by the system certification date.

            (2) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any authority granted to 
        the FHFA Director under paragraph (1)--

                down required under this section shall be prohibited, 
                if the Corporation--
                            (i) in its discretion determines that such 
                        sale, exchange, license, or disposition would 
                        materially interfere with the ability of the

                the enterprises to sell, exchange, license, or

                        exchange, license, or other disposition for 
                        value would be inconsistent with the transition 
                        plan approved pursuant to section 602; and
                            (ii) such sale, transfer, exchange, 
                        license, or disposition for value would not 
                        violate the duties of the conservator.
    (b) Authority of Corporation.--Beginning on the system 
certification date, the Corporation shall take such action, and may 
prescribe such regulations and procedures, as may be necessary to wind

        the FHFA Director may require.

        of a resolution plan required to be developed under paragraph 
        (1), the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Corporation 
        shall retain and exercise full discretion to the extent that 
        either the Agency or the Corporation utilizes or relies on such 
        a resolution plan, either in whole or in part, in fulfilling 
        any duty or responsibility required by this Act.

                        through 1 or more other persons owns, controls, 
                        or has power to vote 10 percent or more of any 
                        class of voting shares of the approved 
                        multifamily guarantor.
                    (D) Expedited application process.--The Corporation 
                may establish an expedited application process for an 
                applicant applying to become an approved multifamily 
                guarantor, provided that any such applicant--
                            (i) proposes to use a credit risk-sharing 
                        mechanism approved under subsection (c); and

        been--
                    (A) subject to a statutory disqualification

            (4) Notice and publication.--The Corporation shall--
                    (A) provide prompt notice to a multifamily 
                guarantor of the approval or denial of any application

                to guarantees provided for multifamily covered 
                securities; and

            (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1) shall 
        be construed to--
                    (A) prevent private market holders from taking a 
                first loss position on multifamily covered securities 
                guaranteed by an approved multifamily guarantor; or
                    (B) limit an approved multifamily guarantor from 
                engaging in other forms of risk-sharing using 
                mechanisms that have not been considered or approved by 
                the Corporation.
            (3) Report.--Each report required by section 302(b)(5) 
        shall include a description of each credit risk-sharing

                approval or denial of that credit risk-sharing 
                mechanism under this subsection; and
                    (B) make available updated information regarding 
                approved credit risk-sharing mechanisms on the website 
                of the Corporation.

                    (A) Exemption from the commodity exchange act; 
                prior consultation required.--
                            (i) Exemption.--No counterparty that enters 
                        into a swap, as that term is defined in section 
                        1a of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a), 
                        for purposes of structuring any credit risk-
                        sharing mechanism that is approved by the 
                        Corporation pursuant to this section, which 
                        credit risk-sharing mechanism is designed to be 
                        used or is used by a private market holder to 
                        assume losses and to reduce the specific risks 
                        arising from losses realized under such credit 
                        risk-sharing mechanism associated with any 
                        multifamily covered security insured in 
                        accordance with section 303 or section 305, 
                        shall be deemed, by reason of such swap 
                        transaction, to be a commodity pool, as that 
                        term is defined in section 1a of the Commodity 
                        Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a).
                            (ii) Prior consultation required.--Before 
                        approving any credit risk-sharing mechanism 
                        that would be exempt from the Commodity 
                        Exchange Act pursuant to subparagraph (A), the 
                        Corporation shall consult with the Commodity 
                        Futures Trading Commission.
                    (B) Exemption from section 27b of the securities 
                act of 1933; prior consultation required.--
                            (i) Exemption.--Any credit risk-sharing 
                        mechanism that is approved by the Corporation 
                        pursuant to this section, which credit risk-
                        sharing mechanism is designed to be used or is 
                        used by a private market holder to assume 
                        losses and to reduce the specific risks arising 
                        from losses realized under such credit risk-
                        sharing mechanism associated with any 
                        multifamily covered security insured in 
                        accordance with section 303 or section 305, 
                        shall be exempt from section 27B of the 
                        Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77z-2a).
                            (ii) Prior consultation required.--Before 
                        approving any credit risk-sharing mechanism 
                        that would be exempt from section 27B of the 
                        Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to subparagraph 
                        (A), the Corporation shall consult with the 
                        Securities and Exchange Commission.
    (d) Requirement to Maintain Approval Status.--
            (1) Authority to issue order.--If the Corporation 
        determines that an approved multifamily guarantor approved 
        under this section no longer meets the standards for such 
        approval or violates a requirement under this Act, including 
        any standard, regulation, or order promulgated in accordance 
        with this Act, the Corporation may--
                    (A) suspend or revoke the approved status of the 
                approved multifamily guarantor; or
                    (B) take any other action with respect to such 
                approved multifamily guarantor as may be authorized 
                under this Act.
            (2) Rule of construction.--The suspension or revocation of 
        the approved status of an approved multifamily guarantor under 
        this section shall have no effect on the status as a 
        multifamily covered security of any multifamily covered 
        security collateralized by eligible multifamily mortgage loans 
        with which the approved multifamily guarantor contracted prior 
        to the suspension or revocation.
            (3) Publication.--The Corporation shall--
                    (A) promptly publish a notice in the Federal 
                Register upon suspension or revocation of the approval 
                of any approved multifamily guarantor; and
                    (B) maintain an updated list of such approved 
                multifamily guarantors on the website of the 
                Corporation.
            (4) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``violate'' 
        includes any action, taken alone or with others, for or toward 
        causing, bringing about, participating in, counseling, or 
        aiding or abetting, a violation of the requirements under this 
        Act.
    (e) Prudential Standards for Supervision.--The Corporation shall 
prescribe prudential standards for approved multifamily guarantors in 
order to--
            (1) ensure--
                    (A) the safety and soundness of approved 
                multifamily guarantors; and
                    (B) the maintenance of approval standards by 
                approved multifamily guarantors; and
            (2) minimize the risk presented to the Mortgage Insurance 
        Fund.
    (f) Reports and Examinations.--For purposes of determining whether 
an approved multifamily guarantor is fulfilling the requirements under 
this Act, the Corporation shall have the authority to require reports 
from and examine an approved multifamily guarantor, in the same manner 
and to the same extent as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has 
with respect to an insured depository institution under the provisions 
of subsection (a) of section 9 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 
U.S.C. 1819).
    (g) Enforcement.--The Corporation shall have the authority to 
enforce the provisions of this Act with respect to an approved 
multifamily guarantor, in the same manner and to the same extent as the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has with respect to an insured 
depository institution under the provisions of subsections (b) through 
(n) of section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818).
    (h) Capital Standards.--
            (1) In general.--Pursuant to the requirement to establish 
        capital and related solvency standards under section 309(b), 
        the Corporation shall establish standards for approved 
        multifamily guarantors as follows:
                    (A) Guarantor activities.--The capital standard for 
                eligible multifamily mortgage loans that collateralize 
                multifamily covered securities insured by the 
                Corporation shall require an approved multifamily 
                guarantor to hold 10 percent capital.
                    (B) Aggregation activities.--An approved 
                multifamily guarantor shall hold capital in an amount 
                comparable to that which is required to be held by 
                insured depository institutions and their affiliates 
                with respect to their applicable aggregating 
                activities.
                    (C) Solvency levels.--An approved multifamily 
                guarantor shall maintain solvency levels adequate for 
                the approved multifamily guarantor to withstand losses 
                that might be incurred by the approved multifamily 
                guarantor in a period of economic stress, including 
                national and regional multifamily housing price 
                declines, such as those observed during moderate to 
                severe recessions in the United States.
            (2) Risk-sharing considerations.--
                    (A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), 
                the Corporation shall consider the extent, amount, and 
                form of risk-sharing and risk mitigation through the 
                use by approved multifamily guarantors of credit risk-
                sharing mechanisms approved pursuant to subsection (c). 
                The Corporation shall allow such risk-sharing and risk 
                mitigation to fulfill required amounts of capital to be 
                held under paragraph (1)(A) while maintaining an 
                appropriate structure of capital as determined by the 
                Corporation.
                    (B) Equivalent treatment.--For purposes of 
                paragraph (2)(A), the Corporation shall seek to ensure 
                equivalent capital treatment between approved credit 
                risk-sharing mechanisms approved under subsection (c) 
                with similar performance histories.
            (3) Other consideration.--To reflect the differences 
        between single-family and multifamily businesses, the capital 
        standards established under paragraph (1)(A) may differ from 
        the capital standards established under section 311 for 
        approved guarantors.
            (4) Stress tests.--The Corporation shall conduct 
        appropriate stress tests of each approved multifamily guarantor 
        that has total assets of more than $10,000,000,000, provided 
        that such stress tests shall be--
                    (A) specifically tailored to the business model of 
                the approved multifamily guarantor; and
                    (B) utilized to--
                            (i) ensure the safety and soundness of the 
                        approved multifamily guarantor; and
                            (ii) minimize the risk the approved 
                        multifamily guarantor may present to the 
                        Mortgage Insurance Fund.
    (i) Resolution Authority for Failing Multifamily Guarantors.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        Federal law, the law of any State, or the constitution of any 
        State, the Corporation shall--
                    (A) have the authority to act, in the same manner 
                and to the same extent, with respect to an approved 
                multifamily guarantor as the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Corporation has with respect to an insured depository 
                institution under subsections (c) through (s) of 
                section 11 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 
                U.S.C. 1821), section 12 of the Federal Deposit 
                Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1822), and section 13 of the 
                Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1823), while 
                tailoring such actions to the specific business model 
                of the approved multifamily guarantor, as may be 
                necessary to properly exercise such authority under 
                this subsection;
                    (B) in carrying out any authority provided in 
                subparagraph (A), act, in the same manner and to the 
                same extent, with respect to the Mortgage Insurance 
                Fund as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may 
                act with respect to the Deposit Insurance Fund under 
                the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act set 
                forth in subparagraph (A);
                    (C) prescribe regulations governing the applicable 
                rights, duties, and obligations of an approved 
                multifamily guarantor placed into resolution under this 
                subsection, its creditors, counterparties, and other 
                persons, as the Corporation deems necessary to properly 
                exercise the authority provided in subparagraph (A);
                    (D) consistent with the authorities provided in 
                subparagraph (A), immediately place an insolvent 
                approved multifamily guarantor into receivership; and
                    (E) upon placing an approved multifamily guarantor 
                into receivership, treat multifamily covered securities 
                insured by the Corporation under section 303 in the 
                same manner as the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                Corporation treats deposit liabilities under section 
                11(d)(11)(A)(ii) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 
                and insured deposits under section 11(f) of the Federal 
                Deposit Insurance Act, where the Corporation shall have 
                the same right of subrogation as the Federal Deposit 
                Insurance Corporation has under section 11(g) of the 
                Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
            (2) Least-cost resolution required.--The Corporation may 
        not exercise any authority under paragraph (1) with respect to

        the Corporation in connection with the exercise of any such 
        authority with respect to such approved multifamily guarantor 
        is the least costly to the Mortgage Insurance Fund, consistent 
        with the least cost approach specified in the Federal Deposit 
        Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1811 et seq.), of all possible methods 
        for meeting the Corporation's obligations under this Act and 
        expeditiously concluding its resolution activities, subject to 
        section 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act where the 
        Corporation and the Board of Directors shall have the same 
        authority as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the 
        Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's board of directors.
            (3) Taxpayer protection.--The Corporation, in carrying out 
        any authority provided in this subsection, shall prescribe 
        regulations to ensure that any amounts owed to the United 
        States, unless the United States agrees or consents otherwise, 
        shall have priority following administrative expenses of the 
        receiver when satisfying unsecured claims against an approved 
        multifamily guarantor, or the receiver therefor, that are 
        proven to the satisfaction of the receiver.
    (j) Hearing.--Upon notice of denial of an application for approval 
under subsection (b) or upon a notice of suspension or revocation of 
the approved status of an approved multifamily guarantor under 
subsection (d), the applicant or approved multifamily guarantor shall 
be afforded a hearing under subsection (h) of section 8 of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(h)), in the same manner and to 
the same extent as if the Corporation were the appropriate Federal 
banking agency, provided that the approved multifamily guarantor 
submits a request to the Corporation for a hearing not later than 10 
days after the date on which the notice is published under subsection 
(b)(3) or (d)(3).
    (k) Prohibited Activity.--An approved multifamily guarantor may 
not--
            (1) originate eligible multifamily mortgage loans; or
            (2) be an affiliate of a person that actively engages in 
        the business of originating eligible multifamily mortgage 
        loans.
    (l) Guarantors Required to Pay Claims.--Subject to such standards 
as the Corporation may provide, an approved multifamily guarantor may 
not for any reason withhold payment of funds that would ensure holders 
of multifamily covered securities receive timely payment of principal 
and interest on multifamily covered securities. The Corporation shall 
by regulation develop a process for the mediation and resolution of 
disputed payment amounts.

families.
    (b) Determination of Affordability of Rental Housing Units.--For

                        conditions in the multifamily housing market;

                        intent of this section.
            (3) Limitation on authority.--The Corporation shall
