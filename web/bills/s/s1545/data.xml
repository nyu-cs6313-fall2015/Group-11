  <summary>12/2/2013--Public Law.
PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act of 2013 - (Sec. 2) Amends the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 to extend through FY2018 requirements that: (1) the Inspectors General of the Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of Governors, of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) jointly develop oversight plans to combat global HIV/AIDS.

(Sec. 3) Extends through September 30, 2019, the requirement that the Global AIDS Coordinator complete an annual study of treatment providers.

Requires that the 2013-2018 studies include: (1) a plan for conducting cost studies of U.S. assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to combat HIV/AIDS in each partner country, and (2) an expenditure analysis by partner country.

Defines "partner country" as a country with a minimum U.S. government investment of HIV/AIDS assistance of at least $5 million in the prior fiscal year.

(Sec. 4) Extends through FY2018: (1) the 33% cap on U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; (2) the requirement that 20% of Fund contributions be withheld unless the Fund meets certain transparency requirements; and (3) the requirement to withhold from Fund contributions an amount equal to the amount expended by the Fund to the government of each country that supports international terrorism.

(Sec. 5) Amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to revise the annual HIV/AIDS report requirements.

Requires the report to describe program evaluations completed during the reporting period, including whether all completed evaluations have been published on a publicly available Internet website, and whether any of them did not adhere to the common evaluation standards of practice.

 Directs the Global AIDS Coordinator to publish on a publicly available Internet website by February 1, 2014, the common evaluation standards of practice.

(Sec. 6) Extends through FY2018 the 10% funding set-aside for orphans and other children affected by, or vulnerable to, HIV/AIDS.

 Extends through FY2018 the requirement that more than half of the amounts appropriated for bilateral global HIV/AIDS assistance be expended for: (1) antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS, (2) clinical monitoring of HIV-seropositive people not in need of antiretroviral treatment, (3) care for associated opportunistic infections, (4) nutrition and food support for people living with HIV/AIDS, and (5) other essential HIV/AIDS-related medical care for people living with HIV/AIDS.</summary>
