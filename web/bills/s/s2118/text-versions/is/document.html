                Constitution of the United States to take care that a 
                law be faithfully executed, with respect to

        the filing of a notice of appeal within 10 days, and the filing 
        of a jurisdictional statement within 30 days, of the entry of 
        the final decision; and
            (4) it shall be the duty of the United States district 
        courts and the Supreme Court of the United States to advance on 
        the docket and to expedite to the greatest extent possible the 
        disposition of the civil action and appeal.
