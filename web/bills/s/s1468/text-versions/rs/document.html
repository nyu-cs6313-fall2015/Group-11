                                 A BILL


 
   To require the Secretary of Commerce to establish the Network for 
            Manufacturing Innovation and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Revitalize American 
Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2013''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In 2011, manufacturing contributed 
        $1,800,000,000,000 to the Nation's economy and accounted for 47 
        percent of all United States exports.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) If ranked as its own country, the United 
        States manufacturing sector would be the 10th largest economy 
        in the world.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) American manufacturers employ more than 
        11,000,000,000 Americans in jobs with wages and benefits that 
        are one-third higher than the wages and benefits in other 
        sectors.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Manufacturing has the highest multiplier 
        effect, with every dollar in final sales of manufactured 
        products resulting in $1.34 in output from other 
        sectors.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) As the source of nearly one-third of the 
        United States investment in research and development 
        manufacturing, firms drive innovation in the United 
        States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) Countries such as Korea, Japan, and Germany 
        have a larger share of the advanced manufacturing sector than 
        the United States. Each of these countries has a positive trade 
        balance in advanced manufacturing products. In contrast, the 
        United States had an $81,000,000,000 trade deficit in 
        2010.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) The United States share of research and 
        development spending dropped from 43.1 percent in 1998 to 37.3 
        percent in 2008, while China's share of research and 
        development spending increased from 3 percent to 11.4 percent 
        during the same period.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) According to a survey by the Council on 
        Competitiveness, chief executive officers view the quality and 
        availability of scientists, researchers, and engineers and the 
        quality and availability of skilled production workers as the 
        first and second most important drivers of 
        competitiveness.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) According to the Organization for Economic Co-
        Operation and Development, the United States ranked 27th out of 
        29 developed countries in the percentage of students who earned 
        bachelor's degrees in science and engineering in 
        2009.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) Colleges in China and India award more 4-year 
        engineering bachelor's degrees than United States 
        colleges.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NETWORK FOR MANUFACTURING 
              INNOVATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act (15 
U.S.C. 271 et seq.) is amended--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) by redesignating section 34 as section 35; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) by inserting after section 33 (15 U.S.C. 278r) 
        the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
