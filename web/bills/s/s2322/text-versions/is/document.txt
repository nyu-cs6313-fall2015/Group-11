    (c) Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) while significant progress has occurred due to 
                the establishment of the disadvantaged business 
                enterprise program, discrimination and related barriers 
                continue to pose significant obstacles for minority- 
                and women-owned businesses seeking to do business in 
                federally assisted surface transportation markets 
                across the United States;
                    (B) the continuing barriers described in 
                subparagraph (A) merit the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program;
                    (C) Congress has received and reviewed testimony 
                and documentation of race and gender discrimination 
                from numerous sources, including congressional hearings 
                and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued by 
                public and private agencies, news stories, reports of 
                discrimination by organizations and individuals, and 
                discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- and 
                gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to 
                address the problem;
                    (D) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across 
                the United States poses a barrier to full and fair 
                participation in surface transportation-related 
                businesses of women business owners and minority 
                business owners and has impacted firm development and 
                many aspects of surface transportation-related business 
                in the public and private markets; and
                    (E) the testimony and documentation described in 
                subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a 
                compelling need for the continuation of the 
                disadvantaged business enterprise program to address 
                race and gender discrimination in surface 
                transportation-related business.

                        Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)).
                            (ii) Exclusions.--The term ``small business

                        economically disadvantaged individual or 
                        individuals that have average annual gross

                        excess of $22,410,000, as adjusted annually by 
                        the Secretary for inflation.
                    (B) Socially and economically disadvantaged

                in the State; and
                    (B) notify the Secretary, in writing, of the 
                percentage of the small business concerns that are 
                controlled by--

                        disadvantaged individuals (other than women); 
                        and
                            (iii) individuals who are women and are 
                        otherwise socially and economically

                respect to a potential small business concern--
                            (i) on-site visits;
                            (ii) personal interviews with personnel;
                            (iii) issuance or inspection of licenses;

                    (B) such other information as the Secretary 
                determines to be appropriate for the proper monitoring 
                of the disadvantaged business enterprise program.
            (7) Compliance with court orders.--Nothing in this 
        subsection limits the eligibility of an individual or entity to

                limitation for the fiscal year.
            (2) Ratio.--Funds shall be distributed under paragraph (1) 
        in the same proportion as the distribution of obligation

                                project to a later construction season;

                        of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) or any other
