                possession does not impose a generally applicable 
                income tax, or

                        capacity taxpayer.
        Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to imply the 
        proper treatment of any such amount not in excess of the amount 
        determined under subparagraph (B).

                or possession.
                    ``(B) Exceptions.--Such term shall not include a 
                tax unless it has substantial application, by its terms 
                and in practice, to--
                            ``(i) persons who are not dual capacity 
                        taxpayers, and
