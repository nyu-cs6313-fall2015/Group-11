              relating to abortion
    ``(a) Offense.--
            ``(1) Generally.--Except as provided in subsection (b), 
        whoever knowingly transports a minor across a State line, with 
        the intent that such minor obtain an abortion, and thereby in 
        fact abridges the right of a parent under a law requiring 
        parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision, in force 
        in the State where the minor resides, shall be fined under this 
        title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.
            ``(2) Definition.--For the purposes of this subsection, an 
        abridgement of the right of a parent occurs if an abortion is 
        performed or induced on the minor, in a State or a foreign 
        nation other than the State where the minor resides, without 
        the parental consent or notification, or the judicial 
        authorization, that would have been required by that law had

        resides.

            ``(1) The prohibition of subsection (a) does not apply if 
        the abortion was necessary to save the life of the minor 
        because her life was endangered by a physical disorder,

        endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the 
        pregnancy itself.
            ``(2) A minor transported in violation of this section, and 
        any parent of that minor, may not be prosecuted or sued for a 
        violation of this section, a conspiracy to violate this 
        section, or an offense under section 2 or 3 of this title based 
        on a violation of this section.
    ``(c) Affirmative Defense.--It is an affirmative defense to a 
prosecution for an offense, or to a civil action, based on a violation

        defendant obtained directly from a parent of the minor, that 
        before the minor obtained the abortion, the parental consent or 
        notification took place that would have been required by the 
        law requiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion 
        decision, had the abortion been performed in the State where 
        the minor resides; or
            ``(2) was presented with documentation showing with a 
        reasonable degree of certainty that a court in the minor's 
        State of residence waived any parental notification required by 
        the laws of that State, or otherwise authorized that the minor 
        be allowed to procure an abortion.
    ``(d) Civil Action.--Any parent who suffers harm from a violation 
of subsection (a) may obtain appropriate relief in a civil action 
unless the parent has committed an act of incest with the minor subject 
to subsection (a).
