  <summary>6/26/2014--Introduced.
Colonias Improvement Act of 2014 - Directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue, in consultation with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), a rule defining colonia (a type of settlement along the border of the United States and Mexico) that:

 is the same for any program of the EPA, HUD, or USDA that specifically includes assistance for colonias (covered program); is limited to a community that is located within 75 miles of the border or that has applied for or received funding under a covered program before this Act's enactment; reflects and preserves the historic, geographic, and cultural character of the communities served by the covered program; and may be used to determine whether an applicant qualifies for assistance under a program. Directs the EPA, HUD, and USDA to establish and update an online clearinghouse with information relating to covered programs and links to information specific to each state.

Requires EPA to establish a working group that includes HUD and USDA to review covered programs, record information relating to each award made under a covered program, hold public hearings, and make recommendations to Congress for improving the programs.</summary>
