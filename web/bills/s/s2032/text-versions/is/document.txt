                                 A BILL


 
To require mobile service providers and mobile device manufacturers to 
give consumers the ability to remotely delete data from mobile devices 
                  and render such devices inoperable.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Smartphone Theft Prevention Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) mobile device theft costs consumers $30,000,000,000 
        each year, according to the Federal Communications Commission;
            (2) 1 in 3 robberies include the theft of a mobile device;
            (3) carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, and the 
        Federal Communications Commission have worked to address the 
        growing trend of mobile device theft, but more remains to be 
        done;
            (4) consumers deserve to have the most secure technology 
        available to protect them and their information;
            (5) technological protections continue to develop, evolve, 
        and improve in ways that are good for the economy and the 
        consumers of the United States, and for public safety in the 
        United States;
            (6) the wireless industry should work with law enforcement 
        to educate consumers about the security tools that are 
        available to them and how to keep their data, their devices, 
        and themselves safe; and
            (7) because engineering and security needs change rapidly, 
        the mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer 
        advocates are best suited to proactively develop solutions to 
        protect consumers, drive innovation, and deter theft.

        mobile service or commercial mobile data service on the device 
        may make available on the device the function required under
