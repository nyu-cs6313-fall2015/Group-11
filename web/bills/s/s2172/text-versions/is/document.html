SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) People in the United States understand that intentional 
        workplace discrimination is wrong.
            (2) Equal pay for equal work is a principle and practice 
        that should be observed by all employers.
            (3) Women constitute a significant portion of the workforce 
        of the United States.
            (4) An increasing number of families in the United States 
        depend on the income of a working woman.
            (5) Many women are pursuing or have attained postsecondary 
        degrees or specialized training to make them strong candidates 
        for good jobs that will provide for their families.
            (6) Employers that intentionally discriminate on the basis 
        of sex should be held accountable for their wrongdoing.

SEC. 3. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY REQUIREMENTS.

    Section 15 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 215) 
is amended--

        filed'' and all that follows through ``committee;'' and 
        inserting ``employee--
                    ``(A) has made a charge or filed any complaint or 
                instituted or caused to be instituted any 
                investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action under or

                the wages of the employee or another employee;''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(c) Subsection (a)(3)(B) shall not apply to instances in which an 
employee who has access to the wage information of other employees as a 
part of such employee's essential job functions discloses the wages of 
such other employees to an individual who does not otherwise have 
access to such information, unless such disclosure is in response to a 
charge or complaint or in furtherance of an investigation, proceeding, 
hearing, or action under section 6(d), including an investigation 
conducted by the employer. Nothing in this subsection shall be 
construed to limit the rights of an employee provided under any other 
provision of law.''.
