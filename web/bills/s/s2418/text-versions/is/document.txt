      TITLE II--PROTECTION OF EMPLOYEE AND RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS

SEC. 201. NOTIFICATION OF EXTENT TO WHICH HEALTH BENEFITS CAN BE 
              MODIFIED OR TERMINATED.

    (a) Inclusion in Summary Plan Description.--Section 102(b) of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1022) is 
amended by inserting ``; in the case of a group health plan (as so 
defined), whether the provisions of the plan permit the plan sponsor or

participant or beneficiary relating to benefits of a retired employee 
or the dependents of a retired employee under a group health plan (as 
defined in section 733(a)(1)), the presumption for purposes of such 
suit shall be that as of the date an employee retires or completes 20 
years of service with the employer, benefits available under the plan 
during retirement of the employee are fully vested and cannot be 
modified or terminated for the life of the employee or, if longer, the 
life of the employee's spouse. This presumption can be overcome only 
upon a showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the terms of the 
group health plan allow for a modification or termination of benefits 
available under the plan and that the employee, prior to becoming a 
participant in the plan, was made aware, in clear and unambiguous 
terms, that the plan allowed for such modification or termination of 
benefits.''.

amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(h) It shall be an unfair labor practice for any labor 
organization and any employer to enter into any contract or agreement, 
express or implied, whereby the organization and employer agree to 
modify the terms of any previous agreement in a manner that would 
result in a reduction or termination of retiree health insurance 
benefits provided to an employee or a dependent of an employee under 
the previous agreement, if such modification of the terms of the 
previous agreement occurs after the date on which the employee 
retires.''.

SEC. 203. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REPORT.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of

shall submit to Congress a report on the strategies that corporations 
use to avoid obligations to pay promised employee and retiree benefits.
    (b) Contents.--The report under subsection (a) shall include a 
discussion of--
            (1) the use of spin-offs, mergers, subsidiaries, 
        bankruptcies, asset sales, and other strategies to avoid 
        obligations to pay promised employee and retiree benefits;
            (2) the impact of such avoidance on the financial, 
        physical, and mental well-being of employees and retirees;
            (3) the impact on Federal and State budgets when employers 
        terminate or reduce the benefits of employees and retirees, 
        including the costs that are incurred when employees and 
        retirees seek assistance from Federal and State government 
        programs and services as a result of the termination or 
        reduction of their employment-related benefits; and
            (4) recommendations to prevent corporations from evading 
        contractual obligations to pay employee and retiree benefits.
