        programs authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act 
        of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.), which shall--

                information based on past, current, and projected data 
                as to the appropriate index and mark-up rate for the 
                Federal Government's cost of borrowing that would allow 
                the Federal Government to effectively administer and 
                cover the cost of the Federal student programs 
                authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act

                    (B) provide the information described in this

                costs, interest rate, and other loan terms and 
                conditions; and
                    (C) set forth clear recommendations to the relevant 
                authorizing committees of Congress as to how future 
                legislation can incorporate the results of the study 
                described in this section to allow for the 
                administration of the Federal student loan programs 
                authorized under title IV of the Higher Education Act 
                of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.) without generating any 
                additional revenue to the Federal Government except 
                revenue that is needed to carry out such programs; and
            (2) prepare and submit a report to the Committee on Health, 
        Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee 
        on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives 
        setting forth the conclusions of the study described in this 
        section in such a manner that the recommendations included in 
        the report can inform future reauthorizations of the Higher 
        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.).
