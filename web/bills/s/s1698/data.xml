Requires a consortium, in order to receive a grant, to establish an external advisory committee to review plans, programs, and projects and ensure that projects comply with the consortium's conflict of interest policy.

Provides the terms of grants, which shall not exceed five years initially. Limits grant amounts to $30 million per fiscal year or the collective contributions of non-federal entities. Requires grants to be used for support of translational research, technology development, manufacturing innovation, and commercialization activities relating to clean technology.
