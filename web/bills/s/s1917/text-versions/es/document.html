    (a) Additional Duty of Special Victims' Counsel.--In addition to 
any duties authorized by section 1044e of title 10, United States Code 
(as added by section 1716 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2014), a Special Victims' Counsel designated under 
subsection (a) of such section 1044e shall provide advice to victims of 
sexual assault on the advantages and disadvantages of prosecution of 
the offense concerned by court-martial or by a civilian court with 
jurisdiction over the offense before such victims express their 
preference as to the prosecution of the offense under subsection (b).
    (b) Consultation With Victims Regarding Preference in Prosecution 
of Certain Sexual Offenses.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretaries of the military 
        departments shall each establish a process to ensure 
        consultation with the victim of a covered sexual offense that 
        occurs in the United States with respect to the victim's 
        preference as to whether the offense should be prosecuted by 
        court-martial or by a civilian court with jurisdiction over the 
        offense.
            (2) Weight afforded preference.--The preference expressed 
        by a victim under paragraph (1) with respect to the prosecution 
        of an offense, while not binding, should be afforded great 
        weight in the determination whether to prosecute the offense by 
        court-martial or by a civilian court.
            (3) Notice to victim of lack of civilian criminal 
        prosecution after preference for such prosecution.--In the 
        event a victim expresses a preference under paragraph (1) in 
        favor of prosecution of an offence by civilian court and the 
        civilian authorities determine to decline prosecution, or defer 
        to prosecution by court-martial, the victim shall be promptly 
        notified of that determination.
    (c) Performance Appraisals of Members of the Armed Forces.--
            (1) Appraisals of all members on compliance with sexual 
        assault prevention and response programs.--The Secretaries of

        performance appraisals of members of the Armed Forces (whether 
        officers or enlisted members) under the jurisdiction of such 
        Secretary include an assessment of the extent to which each 
        such member supports the sexual assault prevention and response 
        program of the Armed Force concerned.
            (2) Performance appraisals of commanding officers.--The 
        Secretaries of the military departments shall each ensure that 
        the performance appraisals of commanding officers under the 
        jurisdiction of such Secretary indicate the extent to which 
        each such commanding officer has or has not established a 
        command climate in which--
                    (A) allegations of sexual assault are properly 
                managed and fairly evaluated; and
                    (B) a victim can report criminal activity, 
                including sexual assault, without fear of retaliation, 
                including ostracism and group pressure from other 
                members of the command.
    (d) Command Climate Assessments Following Incidents of Certain 
Sexual Offenses.--
            (1) Assessments required.--The Secretaries of the military 
        departments shall each establish a process whereby a command 
        climate assessment is performed following an incident involving 
        a covered sexual offense for each of the command of the accused 
        and the command of the victim. If the accused and the victim 
        are within the same command, only a single climate assessment 
        is required. The process shall ensure the timely completion of 
        command climate assessments for provision to military criminal 
        investigation organizations and commanders pursuant to 
        paragraph (2).
            (2) Provision to military criminal investigation 
        organizations and commanders.--A command climate assessment

                organization conducting the investigation of the 
                offense concerned.
                    (B) The commander next higher in the chain of 
                command of the command covered by the climate 
                assessment.
    (e) Confidential Review of Characterization of Terms of Discharge 
of Victims of Sexual Offenses.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretaries of the military 
        departments shall each establish a confidential process, 
        through boards for the correction of military records of the 
        military department concerned, by which an individual who was 
        the victim of a covered sexual offense during service in the 
        Armed Forces may challenge, on the basis of being the victim of 
        such an offense, the terms or characterization of the 
        individual's discharge or separation from the Armed Forces.
            (2) Consideration of individual experiences in connection 
        with offenses.--In deciding whether to modify the terms or 
        characterization of an individual's discharge or separation 
        pursuant to the process required by paragraph (1), the 
        Secretary of the military department concerned shall instruct 
        boards to give due consideration to the psychological and 
        physical aspects of the individual's experience in connection 
        with the offense concerned, and to what bearing such experience 
        may have had on the circumstances surrounding the individual's 
        discharge or separation from the Armed Forces.
            (3) Preservation of confidentiality.--Documents considered

        Uniform Code of Military Justice).
            (2) Forcible sodomy under section 925 of title 10, United

military character of an accused may be offered in evidence by the 
accused when that trait is relevant to an element of an offense for 
which the accused has been charged.
