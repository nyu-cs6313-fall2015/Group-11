                                 A BILL


 
 To encourage States to require the installation of residential carbon 
          monoxide detectors in homes, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Nicholas and Zachary Burt Memorial 
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas produced 
        by burning any fuel. Exposure to unhealthy levels of carbon 
        monoxide can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning, a serious 
        health condition that could result in death.
            (2) Unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning from motor 
        vehicles and the abnormal operation of fuel-burning appliances, 
        such as furnaces, water heaters, portable generators, and 
        stoves, in residential homes and other dwelling units kills 
        more than 400 people each year and sends more than 20,000 to 
        hospital emergency rooms for treatment.
            (3) Research shows that purchasing and installing carbon 
        monoxide alarms close to the sleeping areas in residential 
        homes and other dwelling units can help avoid fatalities.
            (4) Congress should promote the purchase and installation 
        of carbon monoxide alarms in residential homes and dwelling 
        units nationwide in order to promote the health and public 
        safety of citizens throughout the Nation.

                    (B) is intended to alarm at carbon monoxide 
                concentrations below those that could cause a loss of
