                or
                    (B) the foreign policy interests of the United

        States foreign assistance for such country generally, or an 
        individual agreement between the Government of the United

fiscal year shall be obligated only for the purpose of such 
designation.

deserving of enhanced legal and diplomatic support:  Provided, That 
each such determination shall be based on an assessment by the 
Secretary based on established criteria, including--
            (1) whether the detained individual has presented credible 
        evidence of factual innocence to United States Government 
        officials;

        detained in violation of internationally protected rights and

        the individual is being detained has received other credible 
        reports that the detention is more likely than not a pretext;
            (7) whether police reports show evidence of a credible 
        investigation;
            (8) whether the individual is detained in a country where 
        the Department of State has determined in its annual human 
        rights reports that the judicial system is not independent or 
        impartial, is susceptible to corruption, or is incapable of 
        rendering just verdicts; and
            (9) whether the international right to due process of law 
        has been sufficiently impaired so as to render the detention 
        arbitrary.

congressional committees a quarterly report on citizens and nationals 
of the United States detained abroad who are more likely than not 
detained arbitrarily and in violation of international law:  Provided,

        diplomatic, taken on behalf of the individual since the last

                the court provided review equivalent to the review 
                provided in this subsection, unless the adjudication of 
                the claim resulted in a decision that was based on an 
                unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the 
                evidence presented in the prior Federal or State court 
                proceeding.
