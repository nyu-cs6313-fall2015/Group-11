(\"Indian areas\" are defined as those areas within which an Indian tribe or a tribally designated housing entity provides affordable housing assistance under this Act.)\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary, in carrying out the demonstration program, to waive or establish alternative requirements regarding the use of rental assistance if doing so is necessary for the effective delivery and administration of rental assistance to Indian veterans.\n\n(Sec. 402) Amends the Act to clarify that the 50-year limit on the lease of trust or Indian restricted lands for housing purposes does not affect any authority to lease those lands that is conferred pursuant to any other law in effect before, on, or after the enactment of that limit.\n\n(Sec. 403) Reauthorizes appropriations, through FY2018, for the provision of training and technical assistance to Indian housing authorities and tribally designated housing entities.\n\nTitle V: Miscellaneous - (Sec. 501) Amends the Act to treat a tribally designated housing entity as a community-based development organization for purposes of the Indian Community Development Block Grant program.\n\n(Sec. 502) Repeals the provision of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Reauthorization Act of 2008 that prohibits the use of funds under that Act for the benefit of the Cherokee Nation unless the Temporary Order and Temporary Injunction issued on May 14, 2007, by the District Court of the Cherokee Nation remains in effect or there is a settlement agreement which ends litigation among the adverse parties.\n\n(Sec. 503) Reauthorizes the Native Hawaiian Homeownership Act through FY2018.\n\n(Sec. 504) Allows all funds provided under a grant made pursuant to this Act to be used to meet matching or cost participation requirements under any other federal or nonfederal program."
