States person is reasonably believed to be located inside the United 
States and that the acquisition is subject to this title or title III 
of this Act, provided that the head of the element determines that 
there exists an exigent circumstance and--
            ``(A) there is reason to believe that the target of the 
        acquisition has communicated or received or will communicate or 
        receive foreign intelligence information relevant to the 
        exigent circumstance; and

during the transitional period, the acquisition of foreign intelligence 
shall continue during any transition to, and consistent with, the 
Attorney General emergency authorization or court order.

persons acquired during the transitional period may only be 
disseminated during the transitional period if necessary to 
investigate, prevent, reduce, or eliminate the exigent circumstance or 
if it indicates a threat of death or serious bodily harm to any person.
    ``(7) In the event that during the transition period a request for 
an emergency authorization from the Attorney General pursuant to this 
Act for continued acquisition of foreign intelligence is not approved 
or an order from a court is not obtained to continue the acquisition, 
information obtained during the transitional period shall not be 
retained, except with the approval of the Attorney General if the
