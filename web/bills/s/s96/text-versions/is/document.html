            (1) to determine whether there are coral populations or 
        other protected species in the vicinity of the platform; and
            (2) to identify any species in the vicinity of the platform 
        that have recreational or commercial value.

        vicinity of the platform, the decommissioning of the platform 
        under the Notice shall be placed on hold until such time as the 
        Secretary determines that decommissioning the platform would

        shall remain responsible for maintaining the covered structure.
