                                needed to fund restoration work that 
                                protects and enhances the resiliency of 
                                trees that are 200 years of age or 
                                older, as measured at breast height, 
                                may be cut;
                                    (III) the removal of trees that are 
                                150 years of age or older, as measured 
                                at breast height, and less than 200 
                                years of age, as measured at breast 
                                height, shall not exceed 50 percent of 
                                the population of those trees in the 
                                project area; and
