                        group or the recommendations report issued 
                        under section 6(d), determines that the 
                        prohibition in paragraph (1) is infeasible to 
                        implement for a specific vegetation management 
                        project, the Secretary shall apply the Decision 
                        Notice with respect to the specific vegetation 
                        management project.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                        Secretary may make site-specific forest plan 
                        amendments to allow the cutting or removal of 
                        live trees greater than 21 inches in diameter 
                        at breast height that are younger than 150 
                        years old at breast height, the cutting or 
                        removal of which is necessary to meet the land 
                        management goals described in subsection 
                        (b)(1).&lt;/DELETED&gt;

vegetation management project in the covered area, the Secretary 
shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) not construct any permanent road, unless the 
        Secretary determines that the road is a justifiable realignment 
        of a permanent road to restore or improve the ecological 
        structure, composition, and function and the natural processes 
        of the affected forest or watershed; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                forest patches at scales from the forest stand to the 
                landscape);
                    (K) to conduct vegetation management projects that 
                create an uneven-aged mosaic of isolated individual 
                trees, clumps of trees, and openings to enhance the 
                spatial heterogeneity of the forest landscape;
                    (L) to restore or maintain understory plant

                                needed to fund restoration work that 
                                protects and enhances the resiliency of 
                                trees that are 200 years of age or 
                                older, as measured at breast height, 
                                may be cut;
                                    (III) the removal of trees that are 
                                150 years of age or older, as measured 
                                at breast height, and less than 200 
                                years of age, as measured at breast 
                                height, shall not exceed 50 percent of 
                                the population of those trees in the 
                                project area; and
