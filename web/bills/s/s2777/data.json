    "text": "Surface Transportation Board Reauthorization Act of 2014 - Removes the Surface Transportation Board from the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish it as an independent U.S. agency.\n\nIncreases Board membership from three to five members.\n\nPrescribes requirements for discussions at Board meetings not open to the public.\n\nAuthorizes the Board to investigate rail carrier and pipeline carrier violations on its own initiative as well as on complaint (as under existing law). Requires proceedings to determine the reasonableness of a rate charged by a carrier to be initiated only upon complaint.\n\nRequires the Board to: (1) maintain a simplified and expedited method for determining the reasonableness of challenged rail rates in cases where a full stand-alone cost presentation is too costly, given the value of the case; and (2) maintain procedures to ensure expeditious handling of challenges to the reasonableness of rail rates.\n\nPrescribes time limits for Board review of rail rate reasonableness cases.\n\nRequires the Board to initiate an ex parte proceeding on whether contract proposals for multiple origin-to-destination movements (rate bundling) have adversely impacted Congress's intent that the Board's rate challenge procedures remain available to shippers subject to railroad market dominance as well as how it can prevent such practices in the future.\n\nRequires the Board to establish a binding arbitration process to resolve rail rate, practice, and common carrier service disputes.\n\nRequires the Board to: (1) establish a database of rail service complaints it has received, and (2) post a quarterly report of such complaints on its website.\n\nExpresses the sense of Congress that the Board, as part of Docket No. EP 722, should: (1) consider the costs and benefits of the annual determinations of revenue adequacy for Class I railroads, (2) review the methodology employed to define the business cycle in its determinations and consider, if necessary, a rulemaking to define the business cycle; (3) consider if a rulemaking proceeding on mandatory competitive switching is needed to ensure a viable competitive national rail system; and (4) ensure that if such rulemaking proceeding is needed that it is completed in a timely manner.\n\nReauthorizes appropriations for FY2015-FY2019 for the Board."
