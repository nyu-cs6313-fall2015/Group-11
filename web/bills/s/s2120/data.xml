  <summary>3/12/2014--Introduced.
Amends the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 to expand the prohibition against the manufacture, distribution, or importation of any children's toy or child care articles containing specified phthalates to include any children's products containing those chemicals. Expands also the list of prohibited phthalates.

Declares that such prohibition shall not apply to any component of a children's product (currently, only of a children's toy or child care article) that is not accessible to a child through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of that product.</summary>
