                capabilities in counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, 
                and border and maritime security;
                    (D) enhance the capacity of the Government of Egypt

                ensuring a proper protection for the civil liberties of 
                Egypt's citizens; and
                    (E) increase transparency, accountability to

                funding for economic development and political 
                assistance programs should be increased as a percentage 
                of overall United States foreign assistance to Egypt, 
                and an assessment of whether there should be an 
                increased percentage of foreign military assistance 
                focused on counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, border 
                and maritime security and related training.
                    (C) A process to assess whether current levels of 
                economic and military support provided to Egypt are 
                achieving United States national security objectives 
                and supporting Egypt's transition to democracy.
                    (D) An estimated schedule for completing the 
                baseline conventional modernization of the armed forces 
                of Egypt with United States-origin equipment.

                        smuggling networks and to detect and destroy 
                        tunnels between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.
                    (F) An assessment of the abilities of the United 
                States Government to achieve the goals set forth in the 
                strategy if defense articles and services to Egypt are 
                withheld.
            (3) Consultation requirement.--In developing the strategy 
        required under paragraph (1), the Secretary of State shall

                over the next 5 years; and
                    (B) information on any contracts or purchases made 
                by the Government of Egypt using interest earned from 
                amounts in an interest-bearing account for Egypt 
                related to funds made available under section 23 of the 
                Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763) and whether

    (d) Strategy.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall 
        separately provide to Congress a comprehensive foreign 
        assistance strategy for Egypt that--
                    (A) addresses how United States foreign assistance 
                can most effectively--
                            (i) respond to the political and economic 
                        development concerns and aspirations of the 
                        people of Egypt, and seek to advance the United 
                        States' strategic objective of a secure, 
                        democratic, civilian-led, and prosperous Egypt 
                        that is a partner of the United States and 
                        advances peace and security in the region;
                            (ii) support regional stability and 
                        cooperation by strengthening the political and 
                        economic relationships between Egypt and her 
                        neighbors;
                            (iii) encourage and support efforts by the 
                        Government and people of Egypt to foster 
                        democratic norms and institutions, including 
                        rule of law, transparent and accountable 
                        governance, an independent legislature and 
                        judiciary, regular conduct of free and fair 
                        elections, an inclusive political process, and 
                        effective, law-abiding public security forces;
                            (iv) support economic reforms by the 
                        Government of Egypt to encourage private 
                        sector-led growth and job creation, create a 
                        favorable climate for business and investment, 
                        fight corruption, and expand international 
                        trade;
                            (v) seek to foster a vibrant civil society 
                        in Egypt, including the unencumbered operation 
                        of nongovernmental organizations, a free and 
                        independent media, respect for women, and 
                        protections for the political, economic, and 
                        religious freedoms and rights of all citizens 
                        and residents of Egypt; and
                            (vi) seek to support security sector 
                        reform, particularly regarding civilian police 
                        forces;
                    (B) includes an assessment of what actions the 
                Government of Egypt has taken, in law and practice, 
                that advance or inhibit the interests, principles, and 
                goals described within this strategy, including the 
                ability of Egyptian and international nongovernmental 
                organizations to operate inside Egypt, especially for 
                the purposes of promoting political, economic, and 
                religious freedoms and rights, democracy, and 
                education, and what actions the Secretary of State has 
                taken to further the same interests, principles, and 
                goals in Egypt;
                    (C) is based on the best principles and practices 
                of effective international development, the provision 
                of matching funds by the host government, leveraging 
                assistance for greater impact together with the private 
                sector, and the goal of graduation from assistance;
                    (D) includes a detailed assessment of resources and 
                amounts that will be necessary to achieve the goals set 
                forth in this subsection over the next five fiscal 
                years; and
                    (E) includes an assessment of the effects of a 
                cessation of bilateral economic support for Egypt on 
                the Middle East region and United States national 
                security interests in the region.
            (2) Consideration of certain elements.--The strategy 
        required by paragraph (1) shall include consideration of--
                    (A) measures to promote and protect foreign direct 
                investment in the economy of Egypt;
                    (B) programs to assist regional economic engagement 
                by the Government of Egypt and job creation in that 
                country through, among other things, assisting in the 
                establishment of free trade zones in Egypt along the 
                Suez Canal Zone;
                    (C) efforts to improve the business climate in 
                Egypt, including by promoting United States trade with 
                Egypt and investment in that country; and
                    (D) efforts to promote market-based economic 
                reforms and to identify barriers to entry in the 
                economy of Egypt that prevent the efficient flow of 
                capital, goods, and services.
            (3) Consultation requirement.--In developing the strategy 
        required by paragraph (1), the Secretary of State shall consult 
        with, among other relevant parties, the appropriate 
        congressional committees, the Government of Egypt, political 
        opposition groups in Egypt, private sector leaders, 
        nongovernmental organizations, religious and secular groups, 
        women's organizations, and civil society groups, as well as 
        relevant international nongovernmental organizations.

        assistance is provided to Egypt pursuant to chapter 4 of part

        provided to Egypt pursuant to chapter 4 of part II of the 
        Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, not less than $25,000,000 of 
        that assistance (in addition to the amount provided for under
