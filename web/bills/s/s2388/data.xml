  <summary>5/22/2014--Introduced.
Energy-Efficient Cool Roof Jobs Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to classify any qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property as 20-year property for depreciation purposes. Defines "qualified energy-efficient cool roof replacement property" as any roof system that: (1) is placed in service above conditioned or semiheated space on an eligible commercial building, (2) has a slope equal to or less than 2:12 (low-slope roof), (3) replaces an existing roof system, and (4) includes insulation meeting specified standards and&#160;a primary roof covering that has a cool roof surface. Requires the adjustment for depreciation to the earnings and profits of a real estate investment trust for any taxable year, in the case of&#160;such property, to be determined under the alternative depreciation method, except that the recovery period shall be 20 years.</summary>
