  <summary>6/17/2014--Introduced.
Women's Small Business Procurement Parity Act - Amends the Small Business Act to revise procurement program requirements for women-owned small businesses.

Authorizes a contracting officer to award a sole source contract under this Act to small businesses owned and controlled by women if each of the businesses is at least 51% owned by one or more women who are economically disadvantaged (and such ownership is determined without regard to any community property law), and if:

 the small business is in an industry in which it is underrepresented, as determined by the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA); the contracting officer determines that it is a responsible contractor; the anticipated award price of the contract, including options, is not more than: (1) $6.5 million, in the case of a contract opportunity assigned a North American Industry Classification System code for manufacturing; or (2) $4 million, in the case of any other contract opportunity; and the contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price. Authorizes a contracting officer to award a sole source contract to a small business owned and controlled by women meeting the same criteria in an industry in which such businesses are substantially underrepresented if the small business also meets specified certification requirements.</summary>
