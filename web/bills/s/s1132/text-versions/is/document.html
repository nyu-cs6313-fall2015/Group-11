            (2) By striking section 2 and inserting the following new 
        sections:
    ``Sec. 2. (a) Federal recognition is hereby extended to the Lumbee 
Tribe of North Carolina, as designated as petitioner number 65 by the 
Office of Federal Acknowledgment. All laws and regulations of the 
United States of general application to Indians and Indian tribes shall 
apply to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and its members.
    ``(b) Notwithstanding the first section, any group of Indians in 
Robeson and adjoining counties, North Carolina, whose members are not 
enrolled in the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina as determined under 
section 3(c), may petition under part 83 of title 25 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations for acknowledgment of tribal existence.
    ``Sec. 3. (a) The Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and its members 
shall be eligible for all services and benefits provided to Indians 
because of their status as members of a federally recognized tribe. For 
the purposes of the delivery of such services, those members of the 
Tribe residing in Robeson, Cumberland, Hoke, and Scotland counties in 
North Carolina shall be deemed to be residing on or near an Indian 
reservation.
    ``(b) Upon verification by the Secretary of the Interior of a 
tribal roll under subsection (c), the Secretary of the Interior and the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services shall develop, in consultation 
with the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, a determination of needs to 
provide the services to which members of the Tribe are eligible. The 
Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services shall each submit a written statement of such needs to 
Congress after the tribal roll is verified.
    ``(c) For purposes of the delivery of Federal services, the tribal 
roll in effect on the date of the enactment of this section shall, 
subject to verification by the Secretary of the Interior, define the 
service population of the Tribe. The Secretary's verification shall be 
limited to confirming compliance with the membership criteria set out 
in the Tribe's constitution adopted on November 16, 2001, which 
verification shall be completed within 2 years after the date of the 
enactment of this section.
    ``Sec. 4. (a) The Secretary may take land into trust for the Lumbee 
Tribe pursuant to this Act. An application to take land located within 
Robeson County, North Carolina, into trust under this section shall be 
treated by the Secretary as an `on reservation' trust acquisition under 
part 151 of title 25, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor 
regulation).
    ``(b) The tribe may not conduct gaming activities as a matter of 
claimed inherent authority or under the authority of any Federal law, 
including the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.) or 
under any regulations thereunder promulgated by the Secretary or the 
National Indian Gaming Commission.
    ``Sec. 5. (a) The State of North Carolina shall exercise 
jurisdiction over--
            ``(1) all criminal offenses that are committed on; and
            ``(2) all civil actions that arise on, lands located within 
        the State of North Carolina that are owned by, or held in trust 
        by the United States for, the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, 
        or any dependent Indian community of the Lumbee Tribe of North 
        Carolina.
    ``(b) The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to accept on 
behalf of the United States, after consulting with the Attorney General 
of the United States, any transfer by the State of North Carolina to 
the United States of any portion of the jurisdiction of the State of 
North Carolina described in subsection (a) pursuant to an agreement 
between the Lumbee Tribe and the State of North Carolina. Such transfer 
of jurisdiction may not take effect until 2 years after the effective 
date of the agreement.
    ``(c) The provisions of this section shall not affect the 
application of section 109 of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (25 
U.S.C. 1919).
    ``Sec. 6.  There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are 
necessary to carry out this Act.''.
