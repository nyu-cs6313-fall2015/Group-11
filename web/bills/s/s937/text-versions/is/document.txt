                        period that allege disproportionate scrutiny in 
                        the process of applying for exempt status under 
                        section 501(a) based on the ideology of the

                Service employees involved in the case, and a 
                determination of whether such scrutiny was related to 
                the exercise of permitted political activities (as 
                determined under subsection (c)(3) or (h), whichever is 
                applicable, of section 501) by an applicant or exempt
