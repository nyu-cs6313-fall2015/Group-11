    "text": "Renewable Energy Environmental Research Act of 2014 - Requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), within three years, to: (1) develop a plan for a comprehensive and integrated ocean, coastal, Great Lakes, and atmosphere science program to support renewable energy development and smart grid technology; and (2) establish the program that is based on the plan and designed to collect, synthesize, and distribute data in a manner that can be used by resource managers responsible for making decisions about renewable energy projects.\n\nRequires the Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Commerce, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Minerals Management Service, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and Department of Energy (DOE) to consider this information when making planning, siting, and permitting decisions about renewable energy.\n\nRequires NOAA to establish within three years a renewable energy information library and data portal to function as a cross-agency repository of data pertinent to renewable energy development.\n\nGives NOAA the discretion to allow any offshore exploration and production facility to execute a memorandum of understanding authorizing the use of offshore platforms and infrastructure for the placement of meteorological and oceanographic observation sensors of a type to be designated by NOAA in support of the Integrated Ocean Observing System. Requires information collected by the sensors to be readily available for use in hazard response as well as available to the National Weather Service, other NOAA programs, and the general public."
