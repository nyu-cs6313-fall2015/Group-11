    ``Sec. 1849.  (a) In General.--
            ``(1) Establishment of program.--The Secretary shall 
        establish and implement an Advance Directive Certification 
        Program (in this section referred to as the `Program') under 
        which the Secretary shall encourage eligible beneficiaries to 
        adopt and maintain certified advance directives to guide the 
        delivery of health care to such beneficiaries. The Secretary 
        shall implement the Program within 3 years of the date of 
        enactment of this section.
            ``(2) Definitions.--In this section:
                    ``(A) Certified advance directive.--The term 
                `certified advance directive' means any written or 
                electronically stored statement by an eligible 
                beneficiary that--
                            ``(i) provides instructions that outline 
                        the kind of medical treatments and care that 
                        such beneficiary would want or not want under 
                        particular conditions, and may also include the 
                        identification of a health care proxy or legal 
                        representative to make medical treatment 
                        decisions for the beneficiary if the 
                        beneficiary becomes unable to make or 
                        communicate those decisions; and
                            ``(ii) is offered by an entity that has 
                        received accreditation from the Secretary under 
                        this section.

                beneficiary' means an individual enrolled under this 
                part.
            ``(3) Voluntary.--Participation in the Program shall be 
        voluntary with respect to the eligible beneficiary and an 
        eligible beneficiary who has registered a certified advance 
        directive under the Program may terminate such directive at any 
        time. Nothing in this section shall require an eligible 
        beneficiary to adopt or maintain a certified advance directive.
            ``(4) Best practices.--In establishing and implementing the 
        Program, the Secretary shall consider best practices within 
        existing advance directive registry technologies, programs, and 
        systems, including web-based or cloud-based advance directive 
        technologies, which may utilize time and date stamps, video, or 
        other innovative measures to protect the authenticity, improve 
        the quality, and enhance the security of such directives.
            ``(5) State law.--This section shall in no way supercede, 
        abrogate, or otherwise interfere with State law governing 
        advance directives.
    ``(b) Registration.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish procedures 
        for an eligible beneficiary to register such beneficiary's 
        adoption of a certified advance directive under the Program. 
        Such procedures shall ensure that registration is available 
        both through an online and manual process. The Secretary shall 
        also establish procedures to ensure Program participants can 
        update previously registered information that is no longer 
        accurate and indicate that an advance directive has been 
        terminated.
            ``(2) Required information.--In addition to such other 
        information as the Secretary may deem appropriate, an eligible 
        beneficiary seeking to register a certified advance directive 
        under the program shall indicate where the advance directive is 
        maintained.
            ``(3) Registration periods.--The procedures established 
        under paragraph (1) shall provide that registration under the 
        Program shall occur during--

                promulgated under section 264(c) of the Health 
                Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
                    ``(B) Access.--The Secretary shall utilize 
                standardized data protections and privacy standards, 
                including the Federal regulations described in
