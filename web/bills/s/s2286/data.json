    "text": "Cutting Contractor Use and Taxpayer Savings Act of 2014 - Directs the Inspector General of the Department of Defense (DOD) to submit to the congressional defense committees, and make publicly available, an annual comprehensive analysis of the global inventory of DOD service contractors.\n\nRequires the Defense Contract Audit Agency, in conducting audits of defense contracts, to distinguish service contracts in its analysis, including by distinguishing the percentage of payment awarded for service elements on contracts containing both manufacturing and service elements. Directs the Agency to submit to the congressional defense committees, and make publicly available, an annual report on its findings.\n\nDirects the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics to submit a plan to the congressional defense committees to improve the acquisition of services by DOD.\n\nRequires the Director of National Intelligence to submit to the congressional defense and intelligence committees an annual inventory of the service contractors used by each element of the intelligence community.\n\nProhibits civilian or defense contracts from allowing compensation of contractor and subcontractor employees for a fiscal year to exceed the annual salary of the President (currently, $400,000). Allows an exception to such limitation for scientists, engineers, or other specialists who are needed to ensure that an executive agency has continued access to needed skills and capabilities.\n\nRequires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to submit an annual report to specified congressional committees on contractor compensation, including the number of contractor employees who were exempt in the preceding fiscal year from this Act's compensation limits.\n\nProhibits the aggregate amount obligated and expended by DOD for service contracts in each fiscal year through FY2024 from exceeding the lesser of: (1) 67% of the aggregate amount expended for service contracts in FY2014, or (2) 67% of the amount appropriated for DOD for the current fiscal year that is available for service contracts. Makes the latter limitation inapplicable if the Secretary certifies to Congress in writing that DOD will not exceed the prior limitation.\n\nProhibits the aggregate amount obligated and expended by DOD for service contracts in each fiscal year after FY2023 from exceeding the amount obligated or expended by DOD on service contracts in FY2002 (adjusted for inflation)."
