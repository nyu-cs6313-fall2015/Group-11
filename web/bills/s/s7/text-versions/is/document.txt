SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Extreme Weather Prevention and 
Resilience Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should--
            (1) prepare and protect communities from extreme weather, 
        sea-level rise, drought, flooding, wildfire, and other changing 
        conditions exacerbated by carbon pollution;
            (2) promote close coordination across Federal agencies and 
        provide strong support to States, Indian tribes, and public and 
        private sector entities to prepare for and withstand extreme 
        weather;
            (3) promote investment in new infrastructure and replace 
        aging and obsolete infrastructure to ensure resilience to 
        extreme weather, disasters, and hydrological change;
            (4) promote investment in clean energy infrastructure, 
        energy efficiency, and other measures to address dangerous air, 
        land, and water pollution;
            (5) promote development of clean energy technologies that 
        reduce demand for oil, contribute to economic growth and job 
        creation, and put the United States at the forefront of the 
        global clean energy market; and
            (6) ensure that the Federal Government is a leader in 
        reducing pollution, promoting the use of clean energy sources, 
        and improving energy efficiency.
