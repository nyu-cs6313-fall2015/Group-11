                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to improve the determination 
 of cohort default rates and provide for enhanced civil penalties, and 
    to authorize the establishment of an institutional risk-sharing 
                              commission.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

    This Act may be cited as the ``Students Before Profits Act''.

SEC. 2. IMPROVED DETERMINATION OF COHORT DEFAULT RATES.

    Section 435 (20 U.S.C. 1085) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)(2), by adding at the end the 
        following:
            ``(E)(i) In any case where the Secretary has determined 
        that the institution has engaged in default manipulation, the 
        Secretary--
                    ``(I) shall recalculate the cohort default rate for 
                the institution under this section using corrected data 
                and information, for all fiscal years for which the 
                default manipulation has occurred; and
                    ``(II) using the recalculated cohort default rate, 
                shall redetermine whether the institution is ineligible 
                to participate in a program under this title.
            ``(ii) In this section, the term `default manipulation' 
        means engaging in a device or practice, such as branching, 
        consolidation of campuses, consolidation or manipulation of the 
        identification codes used by the Office of Postsecondary 
        Education to designate campuses and institutions, change of 
        ownership or control, serial forbearance, or any similar device 
        or practice (as determined by the Secretary) when, but for the 
        device or practice, one or more campuses of an institution of 
        higher education would be at risk of cohort default rate 
        sanctions under this section or student default risk sanctions 
        under section 489A.''; and
            (2) in subsection (m)(3), by striking ``through the use 
        of'' and all that follows through the period at the end and 
        inserting ``through default manipulation.''.

SEC. 3. INSTITUTIONAL RISK-SHARING COMMISSION.

    (a) Establishment of Commission.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Education shall establish 
        an Institutional Risk-Sharing Commission (referred to in this 
        section as the ``Commission'') whose members shall be selected 
        by the Secretary and comprised of the following relevant 
        stakeholders:
                    (A) 2 representatives of national or regional 
                student advocacy organizations with a track record of 
                engagement and expertise on issues related to college 
                costs, consumer protection, and institutional 
                accountability and an alternate member.
                    (B) 1 student representative who is attending an 
                institution of higher education on the date of the 
                selection and an alternate member.
                    (C) 1 member of the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
                Protection with demonstrated knowledge of student loan 
                borrowing and an alternate member.
                    (D) 2 administrative officers from different types 
                of institutions of higher education and an alternate 
                member.
                    (E) 1 higher education researcher and an alternate 
                member.
                    (F) 1 State postsecondary education data system 
                director and an alternate member.
                    (G) 1 representative from the National Center for 
                Education Statistics and an alternate member.
                    (H) 1 representative from the Government 
                Accountability Office and an alternate member.
                    (I) 1 representative from the Department of the 
                Treasury and an alternate member.
            (2) Functions.--Each member selected under paragraph (1) 
        shall participate for the purpose of determining agreement by 
        majority vote on the Commission on the report and its contents 
        described in subsection (b)(4). Each alternate member shall 
        participate for the purpose of determining the majority vote in 
        the absence of the member. Either the member or an alternate 
        member may speak during the negotiations. In the event that the 
        Commission is unable to form agreement on the contents of the 
        report by majority vote, the contents of the report shall be 
        determined by a plurality vote.
    (b) Study.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 270 days after the date 
        that all members of the Commission have been selected under 
        subsection (a), the Commission shall complete a study and 
        develop recommendations for implementation of a new risk-
        sharing system for institutions of higher education that 
        participate in the Federal Direct Loan Program under part D of 
        title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a 
        et seq.) through which institutions would be held financially 
        accountable for poor student outcomes.
            (2) Content of study.--In conducting the study required 
        under paragraph (1), the Commission shall, at a minimum, 
        consider the following issues:
                    (A) Identifying an annual measure or set of 
                measures for the risk-sharing system that would provide 
                the most accurate assessment of an institution's level 
                of success or failure at providing their students with 
                basic educational outcomes, such as degree completion, 
                ability to repay loans made, insured, or guaranteed 
                under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
                U.S.C. 1070 et seq.), post-graduation employment, and 
                post-graduation earnings. Such possible measures may 
                include cohort default rates, loan repayment rates, 
                graduation rates, graduate earnings, and other measure 
                that the Commission considers an accurate reflection of 
                student outcomes, regardless of the feasibility of 
                access to the data required to implement collection of 
                such measures.
                    (B) What specific metrics would require the lowest 
                performing institutions to make annual payments into 
                the risk-sharing system, and what metrics would exempt 
                institutions from making an annual risk-sharing payment 
                based on performance measures that exceeded a minimum 
                level (which level would be identified by the 
                Commission).
                    (C) How the payments for each institution should be 
                calculated, including whether the use of a percentage 
                of Federal Direct Loans disbursed the year prior to 
                identification, the percentage of loans in default, or 
                any other calculation should be used.
                    (D) Whether a sliding scale of payments should be 
                required of institutions based on their performance on 
                the identified measures.
                    (E) Any legislative safeguards or mechanisms to 
                ensure that an institution required to participate in 
                the risk-sharing system would not pass any prospective 
                costs directly or indirectly onto students, or limit 
                access to low-income students.
                    (F) How an institution's level of access to low-
                income students (such as measured by the percentage of 
                students enrolled at the institution who receive 
                Federal Pell Grants under subpart 1 of part A of title 
                IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a 
                et seq.)) and affordability (as measured by average net 
                price) should be considered in the risk-sharing system.
                    (G) Specifying a means for the risk-sharing system 
                payments to go primarily towards students in default, 
                additional aid to low-income students, or any other 
                form of aid to student borrowers most in need, 
                including after degree completion.
                    (H) Whether any extraordinary consideration exists 
                that warrants allowing a waiver process through which a 
                very limited number of institutions would be eligible 
                to apply for a waiver from a risk-sharing payment on a 
                yearly basis, and under what conditions.
            (3) Outside recommendations.--As part of the study required 
        under paragraph (1), the Commission shall develop a public 
        process for soliciting recommendations for the risk-sharing 
        system and shall consider these recommendations as part of the 
        study. The Commission shall factor in any financial or other 
        interests of any submitting party in weighing and considering 
        such recommendations.
            (4) Report.--
                    (A) Content.--Not later than 90 days after 
                completing the study required under paragraph (1), the 
                Commission shall issue, by majority vote, or if unable 
                to achieve a majority vote, then a plurality vote, a 
                report regarding its recommendations for a risk-sharing 
                system. The report shall include the following:
                            (i) A description of the Commission's 
                        findings as to the issues described in 
                        paragraph (2).
                            (ii) A data analysis using the Commission's 
                        recommended metrics that demonstrates how each 
                        institution of higher education that 
                        participates in the Federal Direct Loan Program 
                        under part D of title IV of the Higher 
                        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) 
                        as of the period of the Commission's study 
                        would fare under the proposed risk-sharing 
                        system, including projections for the amounts 
                        of payments the lowest performing institutions 
                        would have to pay.
                            (iii) An evaluation of the feasibility and 
                        unintended consequences of implementing the 
                        recommended risk-sharing system, including any 
                        legislative or regulatory action needed to 
                        implement such a system.
                    (B) Availability.--The report described in 
                subparagraph (A) shall be--
                            (i) provided to the Secretary of Education, 
                        the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
                        Pensions of the Senate, and the Committee on 
                        Education and the Workforce of the House of 
                        Representatives; and
                            (ii) made publicly available.

        may secure directly from any Federal department or agency such 
        information as the Commission considers necessary to carry out

            (2) Privacy.--Any Federal department or agency, State or 
        local department or agency, or institution of higher education 
        in providing information to the Commission under this section

such institution of not more than $100,000 (subject to such adjustments

Status.--
            ``(1) In general.--Upon determination, after reasonable

        institution has engaged in a violation of any provision of this

        title or any regulation prescribed under such provision) or a 
        violation of any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or

            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may take an emergency 
        action against an institution, under which the Secretary shall, 
        effective on the date on which a notice and statement of the 
        basis of the action is mailed to the institution (by registered 
        mail, return receipt requested), withhold funds from the 
        institution or its students and withdraw the institution's 
        authority to obligate funds under any program under this title, 
        if the Secretary--
                    ``(A) receives information, determined by the 
                Secretary to be reliable, that the institution is 
                violating any provision of this title, any regulation 
                prescribed under this title, or any applicable special

                outweighs the importance of the procedures prescribed 
                in subsection (e) for limitation, suspension, or 
                termination.
            ``(2) Time limitation.--An emergency action described in 
        paragraph (1) shall not exceed 30 days unless limitation,

            ``(3) Opportunity to show cause.--The Secretary shall 
        provide an institution that is the subject of an emergency

        unwarranted and should be lifted.
    ``(g) Lifting of Sanctions.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this title, an institution of higher education that has been sanctioned 
by the Secretary under this section or any other provision of this 
title may not have such sanctions lifted until the Secretary has

the institution to be in compliance with this title.

        conduct shall be treated as a single violation.
