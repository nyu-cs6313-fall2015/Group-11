                identified as useful can be coordinated with Medicare 
                administrative data in order to improve the overall 
                data set available to do such studies and for the 
                administration of the Medicare program.

                        to address barriers to the Centers in accessing 
                        such data; and

                      Subtitle E--Other Provisions

SEC. 241. COMMISSION ON IMPROVING PATIENT DIRECTED HEALTH CARE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In order to elevate the role of patient choices in the 
        health care system, the American public must engage in an 
        informed, national, public debate on how the current health 
        care system empowers and informs health care decision-making, 
        and what can be done to improve the likelihood patients receive 
        the care they want and need.
            (2) Research suggests that patients often do not receive 
        the care they want. As a result, the end of life is associated 
        with a substantial burden of suffering by the patient and 
        negative health and financial consequences that extend to 
        family members and society.
            (3) Patients face a complex and fragmented health care 
        system that may decrease the likelihood that health care 
        choices are known and carried out. The health care system 
        should embed principles that take into account patient wishes.
            (4) Decisions concerning health care, including end-of-life 
        issues, affect an increasing number of Americans.
            (5) Medical advances are prolonging life expectancy in the 
        United States both in acute life-threatening situations and 
        protracted battles with illness. These advances raise new 
        challenges surrounding health care decision-making.
            (6) The United States health care system should promote 
        consideration of a person's preference in health care decision-
        making and end-of-life choices.
    (b) Commission.--The Social Security Act is amended by inserting 
after section 1150B (42 U.S.C. 1320b-24) the following new section:
