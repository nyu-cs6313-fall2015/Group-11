 To provide for equitable compensation to the Spokane Tribe of Indians 
     of the Spokane Reservation for the use of tribal land for the 
    production of hydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam, and for other 
                               purposes.

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians of 
the Spokane Reservation Equitable Compensation Act''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    Congress finds that--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) from 1927 to 1931, at the direction of 
        Congress, the Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia 
        River and its tributaries to determine sites at which power 
        could be produced at low cost;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act 
        (16 U.S.C. 803(e)), when licenses are issued involving tribal 
        land within an Indian reservation, a reasonable annual charge 
        shall be fixed for the use of the land, subject to the approval 
        of the Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the 
        land;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) in August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, 
        an agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary 
        permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power 
        development at the Grand Coulee site;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) had the Columbia Basin Commission or a private 
        entity developed the site, the Spokane Tribe would have been 
        entitled to a reasonable annual charge for the use of the land 
        of the Spokane Tribe;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) in the mid-1930s, the Federal Government, 
        which is not subject to licensing under the Federal Power Act 
        (16 U.S.C. 792 et seq.)--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam 
                project; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) began construction of the Grand Coulee 
                Dam;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) when the Grand Coulee Dam project was 
        federalized, the Federal Government recognized that--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) development of the project affected 
                the interests of the Spokane Tribe and the Confederated 
                Tribes of the Colville Reservation; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) it would be appropriate for the 
                Spokane and Colville Tribes to receive a share of 
                revenue from the disposition of power produced at Grand 
                Coulee Dam;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) in the Act of June 29, 1940 (16 U.S.C. 835d et 
        seq.), Congress--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) granted to the United States--
                </DELETED>
                        <DELETED>    (i) in aid of the construction, 
                        operation, and maintenance of the Columbia 
                        Basin Project, all the right, title, and 
                        interest of the Spokane Tribe and Colville 
                        Tribes in and to the tribal and allotted land 
                        within the Spokane and Colville Reservations, 
                        as designated by the Secretary of the Interior 
                        from time to time; and</DELETED>
                        <DELETED>    (ii) other interests in that land 
                        as required and as designated by the Secretary 
                        for certain construction activities undertaken 
                        in connection with the project; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) provided that compensation for the 
                land and other interests was to be determined by the 
                Secretary in such amounts as the Secretary determined 
                to be just and equitable;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) pursuant to that Act, the Secretary paid--
        </DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) to the Spokane Tribe, $4,700; 
                and</DELETED>

        <DELETED>    (9) in 1994, following litigation under the Act of

        Commission Act'' (60 Stat. 1049, chapter 959; former 25 U.S.C. 
        70 et seq.)), Congress ratified the Colville Settlement 
        Agreement, which required--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) for past use of the land of the 
                Colville Tribes, a payment of $53,000,000; 
                and</DELETED>

                Colville Tribes, annual payments of $15,250,000, 
                adjusted annually based on revenues from the sale of 
                electric power from the Grand Coulee Dam project and 
                transmission of that power by the Bonneville Power 
                Administration;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (10) the Spokane Tribe, having suffered harm 
        similar to that suffered by the Colville Tribes, did not file a 
        claim within the 5-year statute of limitations under the Indian 
        Claims Commission Act;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) neither the Colville Tribes nor the Spokane 
        Tribe filed claims for compensation for use of the land of the 
        respective Tribes with the Commission prior to August 13, 1951, 
        but both Tribes filed unrelated land claims prior to August 13, 
        1951;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (12) in 1976, over objections by the United 
        States, the Colville Tribes were successful in amending the 
        1951 Claims Commission land claims to add the Grand Coulee 
        claim of the Colville Tribes;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (13) the Spokane Tribe had no such claim to amend, 
        having settled the Claims Commission land claims of the Spokane 
        Tribe with the United States in 1967;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (14) the Spokane Tribe has suffered significant

        Dam;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (15) Spokane tribal acreage taken by the United 
        States for the construction of Grand Coulee Dam equaled 
        approximately 39 percent of Colville tribal acreage taken for 
        construction of the dam;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (16) the payments and delegation made pursuant to 
        this Act constitute fair and equitable compensation for the 
        past and continued use of Spokane tribal land for the 
        production of hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (17) by vote of the Spokane tribal membership, the 
        Spokane Tribe has resolved that the payments and delegation 
        made pursuant to this Act constitute fair and equitable

        Dam.</DELETED>

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) from 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the 
        Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its 
        tributaries to determine sites at which power could be produced 
        at low cost;
            (2) under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 
        803(e)), when licenses are issued involving tribal land within 
        an Indian reservation, a reasonable annual charge shall be 
        fixed for the use of the land, subject to the approval of the 
        Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the land;
            (3) in August 1933, the Columbia Basin Commission, an 
        agency of the State of Washington, received a preliminary 
        permit from the Federal Power Commission for water power 
        development at the Grand Coulee site;
            (4) had the Columbia Basin Commission or a private entity 
        developed the site, the Spokane Tribe would have been entitled 
        to a reasonable annual charge for the use of the land of the 
        Spokane Tribe;
            (5) in the mid-1930s, the Federal Government, which is not 
        subject to licensing under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 792 
        et seq.)--
                    (A) federalized the Grand Coulee Dam project; and
                    (B) began construction of the Grand Coulee Dam;
            (6) when the Grand Coulee Dam project was federalized, the 
        Federal Government recognized that--
                    (A) development of the project affected the 
                interests of the Spokane Tribe and the Confederated 
                Tribes of the Colville Reservation; and

                        certain construction activities undertaken in 
                        connection with the project; and

                Reservation, $63,000;
            (9) in 1994, following litigation under the Act of August 
        13, 1946 (commonly known as the ``Indian Claims Commission 
        Act'' (60 Stat. 1049, chapter 959; former 25 U.S.C. 70 et 
        seq.)), Congress ratified the Colville Settlement Agreement, 
        which required--
                    (A) for past use of the land of the Colville 
                Tribes, a payment of $53,000,000; and
                    (B) for continued use of the land of the Colville 
                Tribes, annual payments of $15,250,000, adjusted 
                annually based on revenues from the sale of electric 
                power from the Grand Coulee Dam project and 
                transmission of that power by the Bonneville Power 
                Administration;
            (10) the Spokane Tribe, having suffered harm similar to 
        that suffered by the Colville Tribes, did not file a claim 
        within the 5-year statute of limitations under the Indian 
        Claims Commission Act;
            (11) neither the Colville Tribes nor the Spokane Tribe 
        filed claims for compensation for use of the land of the 
        respective Tribes with the Commission prior to August 13, 1951, 
        but both Tribes filed unrelated land claims prior to August 13, 
        1951;
            (12) in 1976, over objections by the United States, the 
        Colville Tribes were successful in amending the 1951 Claims 
        Commission land claims to add the Grand Coulee claim of the 
        Colville Tribes;
            (13) the Spokane Tribe had no such claim to amend, having 
        settled the Claims Commission land claims of the Spokane Tribe 
        with the United States in 1967;
            (14) the Spokane Tribe has suffered significant harm from 
        the construction and operation of Grand Coulee Dam;
            (15) Spokane tribal acreage taken by the United States for 
        the construction of Grand Coulee Dam equaled approximately 39 
        percent of Colville tribal acreage taken for construction of 
        the dam;
            (16) the payments and delegation made pursuant to this Act 
        constitute fair and equitable compensation for the past and 
        continued use of Spokane tribal land for the production of 
        hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam; and
            (17) by vote of the Spokane tribal membership, the Spokane 
        Tribe has resolved that the payments and delegation made 
        pursuant to this Act constitute fair and equitable compensation 
        for the past and continued use of Spokane tribal land for the 
        production of hydropower at Grand Coulee Dam.
