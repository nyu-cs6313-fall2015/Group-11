        recreational, and charter components of a fishery, to a 
        Regional Fishery Management Council established under section

        TITLE II--FISHERY INFORMATION, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT

SEC. 201. INTEGRATED DATA COLLECTION PROGRAM AND ELECTRONIC 
              TECHNOLOGIES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the use of 
electronic technologies such as digital video cameras and monitors, 
digital recording systems, and other forms of electronic technology as 
a complement to, and in some cases a replacement for, observers can 
maintain, increase, or improve the amount and accuracy of observer and 
fishery dependent information collected from fisheries while reducing 
the need for observers and the financial costs and logistical 
difficulties associated with such observers and paper reporting 
requirements.
    (b) Integrated Data Collection Program Assessments.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Regional Fishery Management 
        Councils, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall 
        assess the fishery dependent data needs of the fisheries in the 
        regions and, if necessary to meet those needs, develop 
        recommendations for an integrated data collection program, 
        including appropriate electronic technologies, to gather and 
        analyze data required for fisheries management.
            (2) Elements of assessments.--Each assessment required by 
        this subsection shall--
                    (A) identify the fisheries with respect to which 
                the incorporation of electronic technology, as a 
                complement to or replacement for observers, and 
                electronic reporting can decrease costs, improve 
                efficiencies and data accuracy, or ease the logistic 
                constraints posed by observers in the fisheries while 
                continuing to meet the standards and requirements of 
                the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
                Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.);
                    (B) specify for each fishery identified which type 
                or types of electronic technology can achieve such cost 
                and efficiency improvements; and
                    (C) outline the system, or systems, of fees 
                required in subsection (c)(3) to support the integrated 
                data collection program.
    (c) Regional Integrated Data Collection Program Adoption Plans.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after receiving the 
        results of the assessments required under subsection (b), the 
        Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the relevant 
        Regional Fishery Management Council, shall review the relevant 
        assessment for compliance with provisions of this section and 
        shall develop a plan to adopt and implement, with any changes 
        needed based on the compliance review, an integrated data 
        collection program, including the use of electronic 
        technologies, in each of the fisheries identified in the 
        assessment.
            (2) Elements of plans.--Each plan developed under this 
        subsection--
                    (A) shall have fishery dependent data collection as 
                its principal purpose;
                    (B) shall include electronic technologies 
                consistent with the assessment required by subsection 
                (b) and the review required by paragraph (1);
                    (C) shall include an estimate of anticipated 
                improvements in cost effectiveness, accuracy of 
                information, and management efficiency for each fishery 
                in the plan;
                    (D) shall include an explanation of why the most 
                cost-effective approach is not being used, if 
                applicable;
                    (E) shall prioritize fishery management plans in 
                each region, to guide development, adoption, and 
                implementation of integrated data collection amendments 
                to such plans;
                    (F) shall set forth an implementation schedule, 
                consistent with the implementation deadline specified 
                in subsection (d), for the development, review, 
                adoption, and implementation of integrated data 
                collection program amendments to fishery management 
                plans; and
                    (G) may be reviewed or amended annually to address 
                changing circumstances or improvements in technology.
            (3) Integrated data collection program fees.--The Secretary 
        of Commerce shall establish a system, or systems, of fees, 
        which may vary by fishery, management area, or observer 
        coverage level, to pay for the cost of implementing each 
        relevant integrated data collection program implemented under 
        this subsection.
            (4) Council action.--Not later than 4 years after the date 
        of enactment of this Act, each Regional Fishery Management 
        Council shall amend its fishery management plans as necessary 
        to comply with this subsection.
    (d) Deadline for Implementation.--Not later than 5 years after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Regional Fishery Management Councils 
and the Secretary of Commerce shall complete implementation of the 
plans developed under subsection (c), subject to available 
appropriations.
    (e) Reviews.--The relevant Regional Fishery Management Council 
shall determine a time period for regular review of the integrated data 
collection program.
