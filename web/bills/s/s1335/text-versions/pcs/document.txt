                                shooting opportunities available to the 
                                public.

                after appropriate coordination with State fish and 
                wildlife agencies, allow the participation of skilled 
                volunteers in the culling and other management of 
                wildlife populations on Federal public land unless the 
                head of the agency demonstrates, based on the best 
                scientific data available or applicable Federal law, 
                why skilled volunteers should not be used to control 
                overpopulation of wildlife on the land that is the 
                subject of the planning document.
            (4) Bureau of land management and forest service land.--

                        shooting unless the managing Federal public 
                        land agency acts to close the land to the 
                        activity.
                            (ii) Motorized access.--Nothing in this 
                        subparagraph authorizes or requires motorized 
                        access or the use of motorized vehicles for 
                        recreational fishing, hunting, or recreational

                    (B) Aggregate or cumulative effects.--If the 
                aggregate or cumulative effect of separate withdrawals 
                or changes effectively closes or significantly 
                restricts or affects 1,280 or more acres of land or

                    (C) Emergency closures.--
                            (i) In general.--Nothing in this section 
                        prohibits a Federal public land management 
                        agency from establishing or implementing 
                        emergency closures or restrictions of the 
                        smallest practicable area of Federal public 
                        land to provide for public safety, resource 
                        conservation, national security, or other

            (7) No priority.--Nothing in this section requires a 
        Federal agency to give preference to recreational fishing, 
        hunting, or recreational shooting over other uses of Federal 
        public land or over land or water management priorities 
        established by other Federal law.
            (8) Consultation with councils.--In carrying out this 
        section, the heads of Federal public land agencies shall 
        consult with the appropriate advisory councils established 
        under Executive Order 12962 (16 U.S.C. 1801 note; relating to 
        recreational fisheries) and Executive Order 13443 (16 U.S.C. 
        661 note; relating to facilitation of hunting heritage and 
        wildlife conservation).
            (9) Authority of states.--
                    (A) In general.--Nothing in this section interferes 
                with, diminishes, or conflicts with the authority,

SEC. 102. TRANSPORTING BOWS THROUGH NATIONAL PARKS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) bowhunters are known worldwide as among the most 
        skilled, ethical, and conservation-minded of all hunters;
            (2) bowhunting organizations at the Federal, State, and 
        local level contribute significant financial and human 
        resources to wildlife conservation and youth education programs 
        throughout the United States; and
            (3) bowhunting contributes $38,000,000,000 each year to the 
        economy of the United States.
    (b) Possession of Bows in Units of National Park System.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary of 
        the Interior shall permit individuals carrying bows and 
        crossbows to traverse units of the National Park System if the 
        traverse is--
                    (A) for the sole purpose of hunting on adjacent 
                public or private land; and
                    (B) the most direct means of access to the adjacent

        infringed'';

        and arrows, crossbows, or other weapons is prohibited'' at 
        water resources development projects administered by the 
        Secretary of the Army;
            (3) the regulations described in paragraph (2) prevent 
        individuals complying with Federal and State laws from 
        exercising the Second Amendment rights of the individuals while 
        at such water resources development projects; and
            (4) the Federal laws should make it clear that the Second 
        Amendment rights of an individual at a water resources 
        development project should not be infringed.
    (b) Protecting the Right of Individuals To Bear Arms at Water 
Resources Development Projects.--The Secretary of the Army shall not 
promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from 
possessing a firearm including an assembled or functional firearm at a 
water resources development project covered under section 327.0 of 
title 36, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of 
enactment of this Act), if--

        possessing the firearm; and
            (2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the 
        law of the State in which the water resources development 
        project is located.

SEC. 105. TARGET PRACTICE AND MARKSMANSHIP TRAINING ON FEDERAL LAND.

    (a) Findings; Purpose.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) the use of firearms and archery equipment for 
                target practice and marksmanship training activities on 
                Federal land is allowed, except to the extent specific 
                portions of that land have been closed to those 
                activities;
                    (B) in recent years preceding the date of enactment 
                of this Act, portions of Federal land have been closed 
                to target practice and marksmanship training for many 
                reasons;
                    (C) the availability of public target ranges on 
                non-Federal land has been declining for a variety of 
                reasons, including continued population growth and 
                development near former ranges;
                    (D) providing opportunities for target practice and 
                marksmanship training at public target ranges on 
                Federal and non-Federal land can help--
                            (i) to promote enjoyment of shooting, 
                        recreational, and hunting activities; and
                            (ii) to ensure safe and convenient 
                        locations for those activities;
                    (E) Federal law in effect on the date of enactment 
                of this Act, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife 
                Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides 
                Federal support for construction and expansion of 
                public target ranges by making available to States 
                amounts that may be used for construction, operation, 
                and maintenance of public target ranges; and
                    (F) it is in the public interest to provide 
                increased Federal support to facilitate the 
                construction or expansion of public target ranges.
            (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to facilitate 
        the construction and expansion of public target ranges, 
        including ranges on Federal land managed by the Forest Service 
        and the Bureau of Land Management.
    (b) Definition of Public Target Range.--In this section, the term
