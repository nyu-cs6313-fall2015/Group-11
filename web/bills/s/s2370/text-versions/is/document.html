SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Orphan Earmarks Act''.

SEC. 2. UNUSED EARMARKS.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section--
            (1) the term ``agency'' has the meaning given the term 
        ``Executive agency'' under section 105 of title 5, United 
        States Code;
            (2) the term ``earmark'' means--
                    (A) a congressionally directed spending item, as 
                defined in rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the 
                Senate; and
                    (B) a congressional earmark, as defined in rule XXI 
                of the Rules of the House of Representatives; and
            (3) the term ``unused DOT earmark'' means an earmark of 
        funds provided for the Department of Transportation as to which 
        more than 90 percent of the dollar amount of the earmark of 
        funds remains available for obligation at the end of the 9th 
        fiscal year following the fiscal year during which the earmark 
        was made available.
    (b) Rescission of Unused DOT Earmarks.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), 
        effective on October 1 of the 10th fiscal year after funds 
        under an unused DOT earmark are made available, all unobligated 
        amounts made available under the unused DOT earmark are 
        rescinded.
            (2) Exception.--The Secretary of Transportation may delay 
        the rescission of amounts made available under an unused DOT 
        earmark for 1 year if the Secretary determines that an 
        additional obligation of the earmark is likely to occur during 
        the 10th fiscal year after funds under the unused DOT earmark 
        are made available.
    (c) Agency-Wide Identification and Report.--
            (1) Agency identification.--Each agency shall identify and 
        submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 
        an annual report regarding every project of the agency for 
        which--
                    (A) amounts are made available under an earmark; 
                and
                    (B) as of the end of a fiscal year, unobligated 
                balances remain available.
            (2) Annual report.--The Director of the Office of 
        Management and Budget shall submit to Congress and publically

                            (ii) the amount of the unobligated balances 
                        that remain available;
                            (iii) the fiscal year through which the

                            (iv) recommendations and justifications for 
                        whether the earmark should be rescinded or
