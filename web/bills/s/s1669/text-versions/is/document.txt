  assistance provided to nongovernmental entertainment-oriented media 
                               producers.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Military Equitable Reimbursement Act 
of 2013''.

SEC. 2. REIMBURSEMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FOR ASSISTANCE PROVIDED 
              TO NONGOVERNMENTAL ENTERTAINMENT-ORIENTED MEDIA 
              PRODUCERS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense benefits when the 
        entertainment industry produces media portraying the skill, 
        heroism, capability, and challenges of members of the Armed 
        Forces and their families through increased morale, better 
        recruitment and retention, and improved understanding by the 
        public.
            (2) The Department of Defense is in often the best position 
        to ensure realism in productions.
            (3) The Department of Defense is sometimes forced to 
        decline assisting in productions because expenses incurred are 
        not reimbursed to the accounts withdrawn.
    (b) Reimbursement.--
            (1) In general.--Subchapter II of chapter 134 of title 10, 
        United States Code, is amended by inserting after section 2263 
        the following new section:
``Sec. 2264. Reimbursement for assistance provided to nongovernmental 
              entertainment-oriented media producers
    ``(a) In General.--There shall be credited to the applicable 
appropriations account or fund from which the expenses described in 
subsection (b) were charged any amounts received by the Department of 
Defense as reimbursement for such expenses.
    ``(b) Description of Expenses.--The expenses referred to in 
subsection (a) are any expenses--
            ``(1) incurred by the Department of Defense as a result of 
        providing assistance to a nongovernmental entertainment-
        oriented media producer;
            ``(2) for which the Department of Defense requires 
        reimbursement under section 9701 of title 31, United States 
        Code, or any other provision of law; and
            ``(3) for which the Department of Defense received 
        reimbursement after the date of the enactment of the National 
        Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.''.
            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the 
        beginning of such subchapter is amended by adding after the 
        item relating to section 2263 the following new item:

                            entertainment-oriented media producers.''.
