SEC. 2. REPEAL OF PPACA.

    (a) In General.--The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(Public Law 111-148) and title I and subtitle B of title II of the 
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2011 (Public Law 111-
152) shall be repealed effective on the date on which the Comptroller 
General report under subsection (b) determines that, at any point in 
time after the date of enactment of this Act, the number of individuals 
in the United States who are uninsured exceeds the number of 
individuals who were uninsured on the date of enactment of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act.
    (b) Reports.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United 
        States, in consultation with the Census Bureau, shall conduct a 
        study to determine the number of individuals in the United 
        States who are uninsured, and submit to the appropriate 
        committees of Congress a report concerning the results of such 
        study, including both the number of individuals in the United 
        States who are determined to be currently uninsured and the 
        number of individuals in the United States who were uninsured 
        on the date of enactment of the Patient Protection and 
        Affordable Care Act.
            (2) Subsequent studies and reports.--The Comptroller 
        General shall conduct one or more subsequent studies every 60 
        days (and submit reports based on the results of such studies) 
        until the Comptroller General makes a determination that the 
        number of individuals in the United States who are uninsured 
        exceeds the number of individuals who were uninsured on the 
        date of enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
        Act.
            (3) Sunset.--No reports shall be submitted under this 
        section after the date that is 5 years after the date of 
        enactment of this Act.
    (c) Transfer of Funding.--
            (1) In general.--If, based on the last report submitted

        uninsured individuals for such fiscal year has decreased as 
        compared to the number of uninsured individuals on the date of 
        enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 
        the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall reduce the 
        funding described in paragraph (3)(A) by an amount determined 
        in accordance with paragraph (2), and such amount shall be

        reduction.
            (2) Amount.--The amount determined under this paragraph for 
        a fiscal year shall be equal to the amount which bears the same 
        ratio to the total amount of funding for such fiscal year as 
        described in paragraph (3)(A) as the total number of uninsured 
        individuals determined for such fiscal year bears to the total 
        number of uninsured individuals on the date of enactment of 
        such Act.
            (3) Funding described.--
                    (A) In general.--The funding described in this
