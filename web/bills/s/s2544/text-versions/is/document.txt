Northport Irrigation District in the State of Nebraska (referred to in 
this section as the ``district'') may repay, at any time, the 
construction costs of project facilities allocated to the land of the 
landowner within the district.
    (b) Applicability of Full-Cost Pricing Limitations.--On discharge, 
in full, of the obligation for repayment of the construction costs that 
are allocated to all land of the landowner in the district, the land 
shall not be subject to the ownership and full-cost pricing limitations 
under the reclamation laws.
    (c) Certification.--On request of a landowner that has repaid, in 
full, the construction costs described in subsection (a), the Secretary 
of the Interior shall provide to the landowner a certificate described

390mm(b)(1)).
    (d) Effect.--Nothing in this section--
            (1) modifies any contractual rights under, or amends or 
        reopens, the reclamation contract between the district and the 
        United States; or
            (2) modifies any rights, obligations, or relationships 
        between the district and landowners in the district under 
        Nebraska State law.
