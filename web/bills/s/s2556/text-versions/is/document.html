    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere 
shall--
            (1) conduct an assessment of cultural and historic 
        resources in the waters of the Great Lakes; and

        assessment.
    (b) Elements.--The report required by subsection (a)(2) shall 
include the following:
            (1) Identification of underwater geographic areas in the 
        Great Lakes that possess historical and archaeological 
        resources of sufficient value and density to make them 
        nationally significant.
            (2) A description of the historical and archaeological 
        resources in such geographic areas.
            (3) An evaluation of community interest in preserving and

        network of underwater Great Lakes areas that protect resources 
        of historical and archeological significance, including the 
        existing successful Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, 
        could bring significant educational opportunities, economic 
        development, jobs, and tourism to the Great Lakes region.
    (c) Collaboration.--In carrying out this section, the Under 
Secretary shall collaborate with local communities.
