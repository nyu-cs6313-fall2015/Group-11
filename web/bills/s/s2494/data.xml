  <summary>6/18/2014--Introduced.
Natural Gas Export Promotion Act of 2014 - Directs the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to issue a final decision on an application for authorization to export natural gas within 45 days after conclusion of the review required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

Grants original and exclusive jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the export facility under an application will be located with respect to any civil action for review of: (1) an order by the Secretary regarding the application, or (2) failure of the Secretary to issue a decision on the application.

Requires the Court, if it finds in a civil action that the Secretary has failed to issue a decision on an application, to order the Secretary to issue one within 30 days. Requires the Court to set any civil action brought under this Act on the docket for expedited consideration as soon as practical after the filing date of the initial pleading.

Amends the Natural Gas Act to direct DOE, in the case of any authorization to export liquefied natural gas, to require the applicant to report to DOE the names of the countries of destination.

Requires DOE to publish such information on its website and otherwise make it publicly available.</summary>
