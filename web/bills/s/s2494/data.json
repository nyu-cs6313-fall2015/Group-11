Requires the Court to set any civil action brought under this Act on the docket for expedited consideration as soon as practical after the filing date of the initial pleading.\n\nAmends the Natural Gas Act to direct DOE, in the case of any authorization to export liquefied natural gas, to require the applicant to report to DOE the names of the countries of destination.\n\nRequires DOE to publish such information on its website and otherwise make it publicly available."
