                                 A BILL


 
   To require that certain Federal job training and career education 
programs give priority to programs that lead to an industry-recognized 
                  and nationally portable credential.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Manufacturing Efficiency 
and Retraining Investment Collaboration Achievement Works Act'' or 
``AMERICA Works Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Recent data show that United States manufacturing 
        companies cannot fill as many as 600,000 skilled positions, 
        even as unemployment numbers hover at historically high levels.
            (2) The unfilled positions are mainly in the skilled 
        production category, and in occupations such as machinist, 
        operator, craft worker, distributor, or technician.
            (3) In less than 20 years, an overall loss of expertise and 
        management skill is expected to result from the gradual 
        departure from the workplace of 77,200,000 workers.
            (4) Postsecondary success and workforce readiness can be 
        achieved through attainment of a recognized postsecondary 
        credential.
            (5) According to the January 2011 Computing Technology 
        Industry Association report entitled ``Employer Perceptions of 
        Information Technology Training and Certification'', 64 percent 
        of hiring information technology managers rate information 
        technology certifications as having extremely high or high 
        value in validating information technology skills and 
        expertise. The value of those certifications is rated highest 
        among senior information technology managers, such as Chief 
        Information Officers, and managers of medium-size firms.
