Permits the Board to: (1) investigate such complaints, or (2) transmit such complaints to any other executive agency or the congressional intelligence committees.\n\nAuthorizes the Board to subpoena persons (other than agencies and elements of the executive branch) to produce documentary or testimonial evidence. (Currently, the Board submits a request for the Attorney General to issue a subpoena.)\n\nPermits the Board, at the direction of the majority of its members, to exercise the authority of the Board chairman to appoint and fix compensation of Board staff when the position of chairman is vacant.\n\nProvides for members of the Board to serve in a full-time capacity. Removes exceptions to the requirement that members continue to serve after the expiration of their term of office until a successor has been appointed and qualified. Revises the compensation of the Board chairman, members, and staff.\n\nDirects the Attorney General to fully inform the Board about government activities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA), including by providing to the Board copies of: (1) FISA reports submitted to Congress; and (2) FISA court decisions, orders, and opinions that include significant construction or interpretation of FISA."
