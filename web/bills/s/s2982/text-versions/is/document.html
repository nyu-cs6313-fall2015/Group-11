                                 A BILL


 
To provide for the issuance of a forever stamp to honor the sacrifices 
of the brave men and women of the Armed Forces who are still prisoner, 
          missing, or unaccounted for, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Perpetual POW/MIA Stamp Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Department of Defense reports that more than 83,000 
        servicemembers remain missing since World War II;
            (2) the United States Government has an obligation to--
                    (A) achieve the fullest possible accounting for the 
                people of the United States who have gone missing while 
                serving the country; and
                    (B) leave no person unaccounted for in future 
                conflicts;
            (3) in 1982, the National League of Families POW/MIA flag 
        (referred to in this Act as the ``POW/MIA flag'') became the 
        first flag other than the flag of the United States to fly over 
        the White House in Washington, DC;
            (4) Public Law 101-355, enacted on August 10, 1990, 
        designated the POW/MIA flag as ``the symbol of our Nation's 
        concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the 
        fates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for 
        in Southeast Asia''; and
            (5) the POW/MIA flag should maintain continued visibility 
        as a constant reminder of the plight of the people of the 
        United States who are prisoners of war or missing in action.

SEC. 3. PERPETUAL POW/MIA STAMP.

    (a) In General.--In order to continue to honor the sacrifices of 
the brave men and women of the Armed Forces who have been prisoners of 
war, missing in action, or unaccounted for, the Postal Service shall 
issue a forever stamp that--
            (1) is suitable for that purpose; and
            (2) depicts the POW/MIA flag.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this Act, the term ``forever 
stamp'' means a stamp that--
            (1) meets the postage required for first-class mail up to 1 
        ounce in weight; and
            (2) retains full validity for the postage described in 
        paragraph (1) even if the rate of that postage is later 
        increased.
    (c) Effective Date.--The stamp described in subsection (a) shall be 
issued beginning as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of 
this Act and shall not thereafter be discontinued.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
