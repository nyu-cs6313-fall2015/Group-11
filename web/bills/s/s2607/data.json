(Under current law, selected locations also must include any location other than one described above in an area that contains a high concentration of veterans with traumatic brain injuries.)\n\nExpands requirements for reports on the pilot program.\n\nReplaces references to \"assisted living\" with the term \"community-based brain injury residential rehabilitative care,\" including rehabilitation services within the meaning of such care.\n\nRequires a veteran, in order to be eligible for such services, to have a traumatic brain injury that is classified as complex-mild to severe."
