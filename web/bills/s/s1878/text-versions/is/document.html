                permanent living arrangement is the best permanency 
                plan for the child.
                    ``(E) Require the State agency to document at the 
                next permanency hearing held with respect to the child

        State legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) 
        in order for the plan to meet the additional requirements 
        imposed by the amendments made by subsection (c), the State 
        plan shall not be regarded as failing to comply with the 
        additional requirements solely on the basis of the failure of 
        the plan to meet the additional requirements before the first 
        day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the close of 
        the first regular session of the State legislature that begins 
        after the date of enactment of this Act. For purposes of the 
        previous sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year 
        legislative session, each year of such session shall be deemed 
        to be a separate regular session of the State legislature.

a member of the case planning team at any time if the State has good 
cause to believe that the individual would not act in the best 
interests of the child. One individual selected by a child to be a

birth certificate, a social security card issued by the Commissioner of 
Social Security, a driver's license or identification card issued by a 
State in accordance with the requirements of section 202 of the REAL ID

        appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet the 
        additional requirements imposed by the amendments made by this 
        section, the State plan shall not be regarded as failing to 
        comply with the requirements of such part solely on the basis 
        of the failure of the plan to meet such additional requirements 
        before the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning 
        after the close of the first regular session of the State 
        legislature that ends after the 1-year period beginning with

        legislative session, each year of the session is deemed to be a 
        separate regular session of the State legislature.

        Secretary and the Attorney General on practical and general 
        policies concerning improvements to the Nation's response to 
        domestic sex trafficking of minors from the child welfare 
        system and the commercial sexual exploitation of children.
            ``(2) Cooperation policies.--The Committee shall advise the 
        Secretary and the Attorney General on practical and general 
        policies concerning the cooperation of Federal, State, local, 
        and tribal governments, child welfare agencies, social service 
        providers, physical health and mental health providers, victim 
        service providers, State or local courts with responsibility 
        for conducting or supervising proceedings relating to child 
        welfare or social services for children and their families, 
        Federal, State, and local police, juvenile detention centers

                and commercial sexual exploitation;
                    ``(B) policies that reflect an understanding that 
                safety and well-being of children and teens can be 
                compromised by the sexualization of children, the 
                commodification of children, and a lack of normalcy 
                characterized by isolation, disconnection from 
                positive, appropriate, and healthy relationships with 
                peers and adults, and an inability to engage in age 
                appropriate activities; and
                    ``(C) the relationship between children and teens 
                who are trafficked and the overall coarsening and 
                desensitization of society to violence that puts the 
                public safety of communities across the Nation at risk.
            ``(3) Definition of `commercial sexual exploitation of 
        children'.--The Committee shall recommend a comprehensive

                `Tier II') of recommended best practices for States to 
                follow in combating the domestic sex trafficking of 
                minors and the commercial sexual exploitation of 
                children. Tier I shall provide States that have not yet 
                addressed domestic sex trafficking of minors and the 
                commercial sexual exploitation of children with an idea 
                of where to begin and what steps to take. Tier II shall 
                provide States that are already working to address 
                domestic sex trafficking of minors and the commercial 
                sexual exploitation of children with examples of 
                policies that are already being used effectively by 
                other States to address trafficking issues.
                    ``(B) Development.--The best practices shall be 
                based on multidisciplinary research and promising, 
                evidence-based models and programs.
                    ``(C) Content.--The best practices shall be user-
                friendly, incorporate the most up-to-date technology,

                        at-risk or are victims of domestic sex 
                        trafficking or commercial sexual exploitation.

                        systems and agencies, and should be designed to 
                        help agencies better understand the type of 
                        trafficking or commercial sexual exploitation 
                        involved, the scope of the problem, the needs 
                        of the population to be served, ways to address 
                        the demand for trafficked children and youth 
                        and increase prosecutions of traffickers and 
                        purchasers of children and youth, and the 
                        degree of victim interaction with multiple 
                        systems.
