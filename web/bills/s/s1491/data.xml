Amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with respect to United States-Israel energy cooperation, to authorize the Secretary of Energy (DOE) to make grants to eligible applicants, including projects involving joint ventures of the U.S. and Israeli governments, to promote: (1) natural gas energy, including natural gas projects conducted by or in conjunction with the United States-Israel Binational Science Foundation; (2) improvement of energy efficiency and the overall performance of water technologies through research and development in water desalination, wastewater treatment and reclamation, and other water treatment refiners; and (3) conventional and unconventional oil and gas technologies.

Authorizes the Secretary to enter into cooperative agreements supporting and enhancing dialogue and planning involving international partnerships between DOE, including its National Laboratories, and the government of Israel and its ministries, offices, and institutions. Limits the federal share of costs under such agreements to 50%.

Authorizes the Secretary to establish a joint United States-Israel Center based in an area of the United States with the experience, knowledge, and expertise in offshore energy development to further collaboration to develop more robust academic cooperation in energy innovation technology and engineering, water science, technology transfer, and analysis of geopolitical implications of new natural resource development and associated areas.

Extends the grant program through FY2024.</summary>
