there shall be a rebuttable presumption that any amount or thing of 
value received by a United States person directly or indirectly from an

        time in question, and

        did not represent income related to such United States person.
Any court having jurisdiction of a civil proceeding in which control of 
such an offshore account or offshore entity or the income character of 
such receipts or amounts transferred is an issue shall prohibit the 
introduction by the taxpayer of any foreign based document that is not 
authenticated in open court by a person with knowledge of such 
document, or any other evidence supplied by a person outside the

        amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

Ownership.--
            ``(1) Control.--For purposes of any civil judicial or 
        administrative proceeding under this title, there shall be a 
        rebuttable presumption that a United States person who, 
        directly or indirectly, formed, transferred assets to, was a 
        beneficiary of, had a beneficial interest in, or received money 
        or property or the use thereof from an entity, including a 
        trust, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or 
        foundation, that holds an account, or in any other manner has 
        assets, in a non-FATCA institution (as defined in section 
        7701(a)(51) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), exercised 
        control over such entity. The presumption of control created by 
        this paragraph shall not be applied to prevent the Commission 
        from determining or arguing the absence of control.
            ``(2) Beneficial ownership.--For purposes of any civil 
        judicial or administrative proceeding under this title, there 
        shall be a rebuttable presumption that securities that are 
        nominally owned by an entity, including a trust, corporation, 
        limited liability company, partnership, or foundation, and that 
        are held in a non-FATCA institution (as so defined), are 
        beneficially owned by any United States person who directly or 
        indirectly exercised control over such entity. The presumption 
        of beneficial ownership created by this paragraph shall not be 
        applied to prevent the Commission from determining or arguing 
        the absence of beneficial ownership.''.
            (4) Presumption for reporting purposes relating to foreign 
        financial accounts.--Section 5314 of title 31, United States 
        Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new 
        subsection:
    ``(d) Rebuttable Presumption.--For purposes of this section, there 
shall be a rebuttable presumption that any account with a non-FATCA 
institution (as defined in section 7701(a)(51) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986) contains funds in an amount that is at least sufficient 
to require a report prescribed by regulations under this section.''.

        the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the 
        Treasury and the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange 
        Commission shall each adopt regulations or other guidance 
        necessary to implement the amendments made by this subsection. 
        The Secretary and the Chairman may, by regulation or guidance, 
        provide that the presumption of control shall not extend to 
        particular classes of transactions, such as corporate 
        reorganizations or transactions below a specified dollar 
        threshold, if either determines that applying such amendments 
        to such transactions is not necessary to carry out the purposes 
        of such amendments.
    (h) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect on the date which is 180 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, whether or not regulations are issued under subsection
