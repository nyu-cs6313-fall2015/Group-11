                                 A BILL


 
         To reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should--
            (1) reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 
        U.S.C. 13925 et seq.) (referred to in this section as 
        ``VAWA''), a landmark bipartisan bill that has dramatically 
        improved the national response to domestic and sexual violence;
            (2) renew the commitment of the United States to providing 
        the resources necessary to combat all forms of domestic 
        violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, 
        including important new initiatives to reduce homicides, 
        increase the focus on preventing and responding to sexual 
        assault, and make women on college campuses safer from domestic 
        and sexual violence;
            (3) build upon the success of VAWA in transforming the 
        criminal justice and community-based response to abuse by 
        bolstering and streamlining the programs, grants, and 
        coalitions created by VAWA and expanding the reach of VAWA to 
        meet the remaining unmet needs of victims;
            (4) continue to provide the training, tools, and resources 
        necessary for law enforcement officers and victim service 
        providers to hold the perpetrators of domestic and sexual 
        violence accountable and to keep victims safe; and
            (5) ensure that all victims of domestic and sexual 
        violence, including Native American women, gay and lesbian 
        victims, and battered immigrant women, receive the support and 
        protections provided by VAWA.
                                 <all>
