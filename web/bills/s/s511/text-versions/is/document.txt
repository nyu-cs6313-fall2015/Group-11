    It is the sense of Congress that--

        partnerships with community banks and other lenders, and should 
        work with community banks and other lenders, to ensure that if 
        community banks and other lenders deny an application by a 
        small business concern for a loan, the community banks or other 
        lenders will refer the small business concern to small business 
        investment companies; and
            (2) the Administrator should--
                    (A) increase outreach to community banks and other 
                lenders to encourage community banks and other lenders 
                to invest in small business investment companies;
                    (B) use the Internet to make publicly available in 
                a timely manner which small business investment 
                companies are actively soliciting investments and 
                making investments in small business concerns;
                    (C) partner with governors, mayors, States, and 
                municipalities to increase outreach by small business 
                investment companies to underserved and rural areas; 
                and
                    (D) continue to make changes to the webpage for the 
                small business investment company program, to make the 
                webpage--
                            (i) a more prominent part of the website of 
                        the Administration; and
                            (ii) more user-friendly.
