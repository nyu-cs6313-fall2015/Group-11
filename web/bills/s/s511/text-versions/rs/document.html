&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) small business investment companies would 
        benefit from partnerships with community banks and other 
        lenders, and should work with community banks and other 
        lenders, to ensure that if community banks and other lenders 
        deny an application by a small business concern for a loan, the 
        community banks or other lenders will refer the small business 
        concern to small business investment companies; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the Administrator should--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) increase outreach to community banks 
                and other lenders to encourage community banks and 
                other lenders to invest in small business investment 
                companies;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) use the Internet to make publicly 
                available in a timely manner which small business 
                investment companies are actively soliciting 
                investments and making investments in small business 
                concerns;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) partner with governors, mayors, 
                States, and municipalities to increase outreach by 
                small business investment companies to underserved and 
                rural areas; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) continue to make changes to the 
                webpage for the small business investment company 
                program, to make the webpage--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) a more prominent part of the 
                        website of the Administration; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) more user-friendly.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
