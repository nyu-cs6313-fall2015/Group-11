Amends the Federal Power Act to authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to prescribe just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential terms, conditions, and compensation applicable to wholesale demand response resource participation in organized wholesale energy, capacity, and ancillary service markets.
