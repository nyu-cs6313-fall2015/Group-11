        Proposition 202, the Indian tribes within Arizona agreed to 
        limit the number of casinos within the State and in particular 
        within the Phoenix metropolitan area; and
            (3) this Act preserves the agreement made between the 
        Indian tribes and the Arizona voters until the expiration of
