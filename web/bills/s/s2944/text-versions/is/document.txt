                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Social Security Act to provide for the termination of 
   social security benefits for individuals who participated in Nazi 
                  persecution, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No Social Security for Nazis Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress enacted social security legislation to provide 
        earned benefits for workers and their families, should they 
        retire, become disabled, or die.
            (2) Congress never intended for participants in Nazi 
        persecution to be allowed to enter the United States or to reap 
        the benefits of United States residency or citizenship, 
        including participation in the Nation's Social Security 
        program.

SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF BENEFITS.

    (a) In General.--Section 202(n)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 402(n)(3)) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(3) For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection--
            ``(A) an individual against whom a final order of removal 
        has been issued under section 237(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration 
        and Nationality Act on grounds of participation in Nazi 
        persecution shall be considered to have been removed under such 
        section as of the date on which such order became final;
            ``(B) an individual with respect to whom an order admitting 
        the individual to citizenship has been revoked and set aside 
        under section 340 of the Immigration and Nationality Act in any 
        case in which the revocation and setting aside is based on 
        conduct described in section 212(a)(3)(E)(i) of such Act 
        (relating to participation in Nazi persecution), concealment of 
        a material fact about such conduct, or willful 
        misrepresentation about such conduct shall be considered to 
        have been removed as described in paragraph (1) as of the date 
        of such revocation and setting aside; and
            ``(C) an individual who pursuant to a settlement agreement 
        with the Attorney General has admitted to conduct described in 
        section 212(a)(3)(E)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
        (relating to participation in Nazi persecution) and who 
        pursuant to such settlement agreement has lost status as a 
        national of the United States by a renunciation under section 
        349(a)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act shall be 
        considered to have been removed as described in paragraph (1) 
        as of the date of such renunciation.''.
    (b) Other Benefits.--Section 202(n) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 402(n))

    ``(4) In the case of any individual described in paragraph (3) 
whose monthly benefits are terminated under paragraph (1)--
            ``(A) no benefits otherwise available under section 202 
        based on the wages and self-employment income of any other 
        individual shall be paid to such individual for any month after 
        such termination; and
            ``(B) no supplemental security income benefits under title 
        XVI shall be paid to such individual for any such month, 
        including supplementary payments pursuant to an agreement for 
        Federal administration under section 1616(a) and payments 
        pursuant to an agreement entered into under section 212(b) of 
        Public Law 93-66''.
