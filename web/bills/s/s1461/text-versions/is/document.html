SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States has a history of catastrophic natural 
        disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, flood, fire, 
        earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions;
            (2) although catastrophic natural disasters occur 
        infrequently, they will continue to occur and are predictable;
            (3) such disasters generate large economic losses and a 
        major component of those losses comes from damage and 
        destruction to homes;
            (4) for the majority of Americans, their investment in 
        their home represents their single biggest asset and the 
        protection of that investment is paramount to economic and 
        social stability;
            (5) historically, when a natural disaster eclipses the 
        ability of the private industry and a State to manage the loss, 
        the Federal Government has stepped in to provide the funding 
        and services needed for recovery;
            (6) the cost of such Federal ``bail-outs'' are borne by all 
        taxpayers equally, as there is no provision to repay the money 
        and resources provided, which thereby unfairly burdens citizens 
        who live in lower risk communities;
            (7) as the risk of catastrophic losses grows, so do the 
        risks that any premiums collected by private insurers for 
        extending coverage will be insufficient to cover future 
        catastrophes (known as timing risk), and private insurers, in 
        an effort to protect their shareholders and policyholders (in 
        the case of mutually owned companies), have thus significantly 
        raised premiums and curtailed insurance coverage in States 
        exposed to major catastrophes;
            (8) such effects on the insurance industry have been 
        harmful to economic activity in States exposed to major 
        catastrophes and have placed significant burdens on existing 
        residents of such States;
            (9) Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma struck the United 
        States in 2005, causing over $200,000,000,000 in total economic 
        losses, and insured losses to homeowners in excess of 
        $50,000,000,000;
            (10) since 2004, the Congress has appropriated more than 
        $58,000,000,000 in disaster relief to the States affected by 
        natural catastrophes;
            (11) the Federal Government has provided and will continue 
        to provide resources to pay for losses from future 
        catastrophes;
            (12) when Federal assistance is provided to the States, 
        accountability for Federal funds disbursed is paramount;
            (13) the Government Accountability Office or other 
        appropriate agencies must have the means in place to confirm 
        that Federal funds for catastrophe relief have reached the 
        appropriate victims and have contributed to the recovery effort 
        as efficiently as possible so that taxpayer funds are not 
        wasted and citizens are enabled to rebuild and resume 
        productive activities as quickly as possible;
            (14) States that are recipients of Federal funds must be 
        responsible to account for and provide an efficient means for 
        distribution of funds to homeowners to enable the rapid 
        rebuilding of local economies after a catastrophic event 
        without unduly burdening taxpayers who live in areas seldom 
        affected by natural disasters;
            (15) State insurance and reinsurance programs can provide a 
        mechanism for States to exercise that responsibility if they 
        appropriately underwrite and price risk, and if they pay claims 
        quickly and within established contractual terms; and
            (16) State insurers and reinsurers, if appropriately 
        backstopped themselves, can absorb catastrophic risk borne by 
        private insurers without bearing timing risk, and thus enable 
        all insurers (whether State-operated or privately owned) to 
        underwrite and price insurance without timing risk and in such 
        a way to encourage property owners to pay for the appropriate 
        insurance to protect themselves and to take steps to mitigate 
        against the risks of disaster by locally appropriate methods.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to establish a program 
to provide a Federal backstop for State-sponsored insurance programs to 
help homeowners prepare for and recover from the damages caused by 
natural catastrophes, to encourage mitigation and prevention for such 
catastrophes, to promote the use of private market capital as a means 
to insure against such catastrophes, to expedite the payment of claims 
and better assist in the financial recovery from such catastrophes.

SEC. 3. QUALIFIED REINSURANCE PROGRAMS.

    (a) In General.--For purposes of this Act only, a program shall be 
considered to be a qualified reinsurance program if the program--
            (1) is authorized by State law for the purposes described 
        in this section;
            (2) is an entity in which the authorizing State maintains a 
        material, financial interest;
            (3) provides reinsurance or retrocessional coverage to 
        underlying primary insurers or reinsurers for losses arising 
        from all personal residential lines of insurance, as defined in 
        the Uniform Property & Casualty Product Coding Matrix published 
        and maintained by the National Association of Insurance 
        Commissioners;
            (4) has a governing body, a majority of whose members are 
        public officials;
            (5) provides reinsurance or retrocessional coverage to 
        underlying primary insurers or reinsurers for losses in excess 
        of such amount that the Secretary has determined represents a 
        catastrophic event in that particular State;
            (6) is authorized by a State that has in effect such laws, 
        regulations, or other requirements, as the Secretary shall by 
        regulation provide, that--
                    (A) ensure, to the extent that reinsurance coverage 
                made available under the qualified reinsurance program 
                results in any cost savings in providing insurance 
                coverage for risks in such State, such cost savings are 
                reflected in premium rates charged to consumers for 
                such coverage;
                    (B) require that any new construction, substantial 
                rehabilitation, and renovation insured or reinsured by 
                the program complies with applicable State or local 
                government building, fire, and safety codes;
                    (C) require State authorized insurance entities 
                within that State to establish an insurance rate 
                structure that takes into account measures to mitigate 
                insurance losses;
                    (D) require State authorized insurance and 
                reinsurance entities within that State to establish 
                rates at a level that annually produces expected 
                premiums that shall be sufficient to pay the expected 
                annualized cost of all claims, loss adjustment 
                expenses, and all administrative costs of reinsurance 
                coverage offered; and
                    (E) encourage State authorized insurance and 
                reinsurance entities within that State to establish 
                rates that do not involve cross-subsidization between 
                any separate property and casualty lines covered under 
                the State authorized insurance or reinsurance entity; 
                and
            (7) complies with such additional organizational, 
        underwriting, and financial requirements as the Secretary 
        shall, by regulation, provide to carry out the purposes of this 
        Act.
    (b) Transitional Mechanisms.--For the 5-year period beginning on 
the date of enactment of this Act, in the case of a State that does not 
have a qualified reinsurance program for the State, a State residual 
insurance market entity for such State shall be considered to be a 
qualified reinsurance program, but only if such State residual 
insurance market entity was in existence before such date of enactment.
    (c) Precertification.--The Secretary shall establish procedures and 
standards for State and regional reinsurance programs and the State 
residual insurance market entities described in subsection (b) to apply 
to the Secretary at any time for certification (and recertification) as 
qualified reinsurance programs.
    (d) Reinsurance To Cover Exposure.--This section may not be 
construed to limit or prevent any insurer from obtaining reinsurance 
coverage for insured losses retained by insurers pursuant to this 
section, nor shall the obtaining of such coverage affect the 
calculation of the amount of any loan under this Act.

        the loan and issued during the most recently completed month, 
        as determined by the Secretary, or such higher rate as may be 
        necessary to ensure that the amounts of interest paid under 
        such loans exceed the sum of the costs (as such term is defined 
        in section 502 of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 
        U.S.C. 661a)) of such loans, the administrative costs involved 
        in carrying out a program under this title for such loans, and 
        any incidental effects on governmental receipts and outlays.
            (4) Term.--The loan shall have a term to maturity of not 
        less than 5 years and not more than 10 years.

qualified reinsurance program shall be subject to the following 
requirements:
            (1) Preconditions.--The Secretary shall have determined 
        that an event has resulted in insured losses in a State with a 
        qualified reinsurance program and that such insured losses in 
        such State are in excess of 150 percent of the aggregate amount 
        of direct written premium for privately issued property and 
        casualty insurance, for risks located in that State, over the 
        calendar year preceding such event, in accordance with 
        regulations that the Secretary shall establish.
            (2) Amount.--The principal amount of the loan made pursuant 
        to an event referred to in paragraph (1) may not exceed the 
        amount by which the insured losses sustained as a result of 
        such event exceed the ceiling coverage level for the qualified 
        reinsurance program.
            (3) Rate of interest.--The loan shall bear interest at an 
        annual rate 0.20 percentage points higher than marketable 
        obligations of the United States Treasury having a term to 
        maturity of not less than 10 years and issued during the most 
        recently completed month, as determined by the Secretary, or 
        such higher rate as may be necessary to ensure that the amounts 
        of interest paid under such loans exceed the sum of the costs 
        (as such term is defined in section 502 of the Federal Credit 
        Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661a)) of such loans, the 
        administrative costs involved in carrying out a program under 
        this title for such loans, and any incidental effects on 
        governmental receipts and outlays.
            (4) Term.--The loan shall have a term to maturity of not 
        less than 10 years.
    (f) Use of Funds.--Amounts from a loan under this section shall 
only be used to provide reinsurance or retrocessional coverage to 
underlying primary insurers or reinsurers for losses arising from all 
personal real property or homeowners' lines of insurance, as defined in 
the Uniform Property & Casualty Product Coding Matrix published and 
maintained by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Such 
amounts shall not be used for any other purpose.

SEC. 203. REPORTS AND AUDITS.

    The Secretary shall submit a report to the President and the

        for expenses referred to in paragraph (1).
    (b) Costs of Loans; Administrative Costs.--To the extent that 
amounts of negative credit subsidy are received by the Secretary in any
