  <summary>6/17/2014--Introduced.
North Pacific Fisheries Convention Implementation Act - Authorizes the Department of Commerce to promulgate regulations to implement the Convention on the Conservation and Management of the High Seas Fisheries Resources in the North Pacific Ocean for the United States, which was adopted in Tokyo, Japan, on February 24, 2012. (The Convention establishes a regional fisheries management organization to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of the fisheries resources while protecting the marine ecosystems in the Convention Area.) Applies this Act within the boundaries of any state bordering the Convention Area if specified conditions are met.

 Requires the President to appoint the U.S. representative to the North Pacific Fisheries Commission. Establishes an advisory committee for the Commission.

 Requires Commerce to develop a memorandum of understanding with the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to clarify the role of each Council with respect to participating in or working with U.S. delegations to international fishery organizations and making recommendations related to fishery resources in the Convention Area.

 Sets forth the Deparment of State's authority and responsibilities with respect to the Commission.

 Requires Commerce and the Department of Homeland Security (the department in which the Coast Guard is operating) to administer and enforce this Act, except to the extent otherwise provided for in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.

 Sets forth prohibited fishing and shipping acts in the Convention Area.

 Establishes notification requirements for commercial fishing vessels before entering or transiting the exclusive economic zone of the Convention Area, if the vessels do not carry vessel monitoring systems capable of communicating with U.S. enforcement authorities.</summary>
