                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by 
 establishing a program to provide professional development activities 
                 for educators, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Professional Development for 
Educators Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Through careful development, teachers can build their 
        effectiveness over time, thus improving student achievement.
            (2) Ongoing professional development of teachers in the 
        subjects they teach is essential for improved student learning.
            (3) United States teachers generally spend more time 
        instructing students and less time in professional learning 
        opportunities with their peers than teachers in top-performing 
        countries.
            (4) It takes time, resources, and support for teachers to 
        become highly effective in their classrooms. Teachers 
        participating in quality teacher professional development must 
        be given time to implement what they have learned.

SEC. 3. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EDUCATORS.

    (a) In General.--Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6601 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end
