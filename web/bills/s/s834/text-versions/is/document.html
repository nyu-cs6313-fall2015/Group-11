                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to 
  ensure access to high-quality child care for homeless children and 
                   families, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Access to Child Care for 
Homeless Families Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Homelessness among children and youth in public schools 
        has increased by 57 percent during the period since 2006.
            (2) Among homeless children living in shelters supported by 
        the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 50 percent are 
        under 5 years old.
            (3) A 2010 study by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National 
        Institute of Child Health and Human Development found that 
        children who had received high-quality care in the first few 
        years of life scored higher on measures of academic and 
        cognitive achievement when the children were 19 years old, and 
        were less likely to misbehave, than children who had been 
        enrolled in low-quality care in those years.
            (4) Homelessness has a negative impact on child development 
        that surpasses the harmful impacts of poverty. A Head Start 
        demonstration project serving homeless families indicated that 
        the homeless children served had more instances of 
        developmental delay, learning disabilities, and physical or 
        mental health problems, compared with their low-income peers in 
        stable housing.
            (5) For homeless families, residential instability, high 
        mobility, documentation requirements, and lack of 
        transportation are significant obstacles to accessing and 
        retaining child care services.
            (6) According to a study by the Institute for Children, 
        Poverty, and Homelessness, homeless families are less likely to 
        receive government financial assistance for child care than 
        families that are not homeless.
            (7) Without child care, homeless parents of young children 
        struggle to search for employment, maintain employment, and 
        enter job training programs.
            (8) Many parents who are domestic violence survivors who 
        flee their homes try to find employment, but the parents are 
        often limited by a lack of child care. In a survey of nearly 
        1,500 domestic violence survivors in domestic violence 
        shelters, 29 percent indicated that they needed help with child 
        care.
            (9) In school year 2006-2007 there were 22,650 homeless 
        families served by Head Start programs, and in school year 
        2011-2012 there were 49,164 homeless families served by Head 
        Start programs. The number of homeless families being served by 
        Head Start programs has more than doubled in the past 5 years
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1)(A) Congress has enacted successful policies to increase 
        homeless children's access to and stability in public 
        elementary and secondary schools and Head Start programs; and
            (B) in order to increase homeless families' access to and 
        continuity in child care, similar policies should be applied to 
        Federal child care programs; and
            (2) such policies will assist homeless parents in 
        maintaining employment and regaining housing, and will provide 
        critical interventions to support that vulnerable population of 
        children.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to ensure access to high-quality child 
care for homeless children and families.
