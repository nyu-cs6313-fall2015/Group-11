                        aggregate amount of such contributions does not 
                        exceed the excess of the taxpayer's taxable 
                        income over the amount of charitable 
                        contributions allowable under subparagraph (A).
                            ``(ii) Carryover.--If the aggregate amount 
                        of contributions described in clause (i) 
                        exceeds the limitation of clause (i), such 
                        excess shall be treated (in a manner consistent 
                        with the rules of subsection (d)(2)) as a 
                        charitable contribution to which clause (i)
