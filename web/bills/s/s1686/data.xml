  <summary>11/12/2013--Introduced.
Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act of 2013 - Amends the Controlled Substances Act to make it unlawful for any person at least 18 years of age to: (1) knowingly or intentionally manufacture or create a Schedule I or II controlled substance that is combined with a beverage or candy product, marketed or packaged to appear similar to a beverage or candy product, or modified by flavoring or coloring; and (2) know, or have reasonable cause to believe, that the combined, marketed, packaged, or modified controlled substance will be distributed, dispensed, or sold to a person under 18 years of age.

Imposes enhanced criminal penalties for violations (not more than 10 years for a first offense or 20 years for a subsequent offense, involving the same controlled substance and schedule).

 Exempts any controlled substance that has been approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the drug approval process or that has been altered at the direction of a medical practitioner for a legitimate medical purpose.

Directs the United States Sentencing Commission to review its guidelines and policy statements to reflect the enhanced penalties provided by this Act.</summary>
