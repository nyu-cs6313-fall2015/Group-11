                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            January 29, 2013

Mr. Blumenthal (for himself, Mr. Murphy, and Mr. Lautenberg) introduced 
the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee 
                            on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
             To appropriately restrict sales of ammunition.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ammunition Background Check Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Under current Federal law, it is illegal to sell 
        firearms or ammunition to certain individuals, including 
        felons, fugitives, drug addicts, and those deemed ``mentally 
        defective'' or committed to a mental institution.
            (2) There is no requirement under Federal law that sellers 
        of ammunition conduct a background check to determine whether 
        potential purchasers are in fact prohibited by law from buying 
        ammunition.
            (3) By contrast, under current Federal law, licensed 
        sellers of firearms are required by law to conduct an instant 
        background check using the National Instant Criminal Background 
        Check System of the Justice Department.
            (4) Over the last decade, there have been over 100,000,000 
        background checks conducted under the National Instant Criminal 
        Background Check System with respect to firearms sales, 
        resulting in the blocking of more than 1,500,000 sales of 
        firearms to felons, fugitives, drug addicts, and the mentally 
        ill, among others.
            (5) The vast majority of instant background checks on 
        firearms purchases occur in an average of 30 seconds, at 
        minimal inconvenience to firearms sellers and law-abiding 
        purchasers.
            (6) The requirement of background checks for ammunition 
        purchases would pose a minimal inconvenience to ammunition 
        sellers and law-abiding purchasers, and would help reduce gun-
        related violence.
            (7) Current Federal law includes a variety of other 
        provisions regulating the sale of firearms, including limits on 
        interstate gun sales and recordkeeping requirements designed to 
        assist in criminal investigations, that do not apply to sales 
        of ammunition.
            (8) Sales of ammunition should be held to similar 
        requirements as sales of firearms.

SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.

    (a) Requiring Background Checks for Purchases of Ammunition.--
            (1) In general.--Section 922 of title 18, United States 
        Code, is amended by inserting after subsection (u) the 
        following:
    ``(v)(1) On and after the date that is 180 days after the date of 
enactment of the Ammunition Background Check Act of 2013, no person who 
is licensed under this chapter shall transfer ammunition to any other 
person who is not licensed under this chapter, unless--
            ``(A) before the completion of the transfer, the licensee 
        contacts the national instant criminal background check system 
        established under section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence 
        Prevention Act;
            ``(B)(i) the system provides the licensee with a unique 
        identification number; or
            ``(ii) 3 business days (meaning a day on which State 
        offices are open) have elapsed since the licensee contacted the 
        system, and the system has not notified the licensee that the 
        receipt of a firearm by such other person would violate 
        subsection (g) or (n) of this section; and
            ``(C) the transferor has verified the identity of the 
        transferee by examining a valid identification document (as 
        defined in section 1028(d) of this title) of the transferee 
        containing a photograph of the transferee.
    ``(2) If receipt of ammunition would not violate subsection (g) or 
(n) or State law, the system shall--
            ``(A) assign a unique identification number to the 
        transfer;
            ``(B) provide the licensee with the number; and
            ``(C) destroy all records of the system with respect to the 
        call (other than the identifying number and the date the number 
        was assigned) and all records of the system relating to the 
        person or the transfer.
    ``(3) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an ammunition transfer 
between a licensee and another person if--
            ``(A)(i) such other person has presented to the licensee a 
        permit that--
                    ``(I) allows such other person to possess or 
                acquire ammunition; and
                    ``(II) was issued not more than 5 years earlier by 
                the State in which the transfer is to take place; and
            ``(ii) the law of the State provides that such a permit is 
        to be issued only after an authorized government official has 
        verified that the information available to such official does 
        not indicate that possession of a firearm or ammunition by such 
        other person would be in violation of law;
            ``(B) the Attorney General has approved the transfer under 
        section 5812 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or
            ``(C) on application of the transferor, the Attorney 
        General has certified that compliance with paragraph (1)(A) is 
        impracticable because--
                    ``(i) the ratio of the number of law enforcement 
                officers of the State in which the transfer is to occur 
                to the number of square miles of land area of the State 
                does not exceed 0.0025;
                    ``(ii) the business premises of the licensee at 
                which the transfer is to occur are extremely remote in 
                relation to the chief law enforcement officer (as 
                defined in subsection (s)(8)); and
                    ``(iii) there is an absence of telecommunications 
                facilities in the geographical area in which the 
                business premises are located.
    ``(4) If the national instant criminal background check system 
notifies any person licensed under this chapter that the information 
available to the system does not demonstrate that the receipt of 
ammunition by such other person would violate subsection (g) or (n) or 
State law, and the licensee transfers ammunition to such other person, 
the seller shall include in the record of the transfer the unique 
identification number provided by the system with respect to the 
transfer.
    ``(5) If any person licensed under this chapter knowingly transfers 
ammunition to another person and knowingly fails to comply with 
paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to the transfer and, at 
the time such other person most recently proposed the transfer, the 
national instant criminal background check system was operating and 
information was available to the system demonstrating that receipt of 
ammunition by such other person would violate subsection (g) or (n) of 
this section or State law, the Attorney General may, after notice and 
opportunity for a hearing, suspend for not more than 6 months or revoke 
any license issued to the person under section 923, and may impose on 
the person a civil fine of not more than $5,000 for a first violation, 
$25,000 for a second violation, and $100,000 for any subsequent 
violation.
    ``(6) Neither a local government nor an employee of the Federal 
Government or of any State or local government, responsible for 
providing information to the national instant criminal background check 
system shall be liable in an action at law for damages--
            ``(A) for failure to prevent the sale or transfer of 
        ammunition to a person whose receipt or possession of the 
        ammunition is unlawful under this section; or
            ``(B) for preventing such a sale or transfer to a person 
        who may lawfully receive or possess ammunition.''.
            (2) Regulations relating to retention and destruction of 
        records in system.--In promulgating regulations to carry out 
        subsection (v)(2)(C) of section 922 of title 18, United States 
        Code, as added by this Act, the Attorney General shall ensure 
        that the records described in such subsection are destroyed not 
        later than 3 business days after the date on which a licensee 
        is notified that a transfer of ammunition may proceed under 
        such section.
            (3) Conforming amendments.--
                    (A) Title 18.--Section 922 of title 18, United 
                States Code, is amended--

                                    (I) in the matter preceding 
                                paragraph (1), by inserting ``or 
                                ammunition'' after ``sell a firearm'';

                        following paragraph (9), by adding at the end, 
                        the following: ``Any person who is licensed 
                        under this chapter and who sells ammunition to
