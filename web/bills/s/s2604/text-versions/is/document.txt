                                 A BILL


 
  To authorize the sale of certain National Forest System land in the 
                           State of Georgia.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest 
Land Adjustment Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DEFINITION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) certain National Forest System land in the State of 
        Georgia consists of isolated tracts that are inefficient to 
        manage or have lost their principal value for National Forest 
        purposes;
            (2) the disposal of that land would be in the public 
        interest; and
            (3) proceeds from the sale of land authorized by this Act 
        would be used best by the Forest Service to purchase land for 
        National Forest purposes in the State of Georgia.
    (b) Definition of Secretary.--In this Act, the term ``Secretary'' 
means the Secretary of Agriculture.

SEC. 3. LAND CONVEYANCE AUTHORITY.
