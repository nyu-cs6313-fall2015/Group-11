    "text": "Local Empowerment Act - Revises requirements for the apportionment of state planning funds to metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs).\n\nRequires a state's apportionment to be distributed in accordance with a formula that prioritizes the needs of high performing MPOs.\n\nRevises certain allocations of surface transportation program funds to states for: (1) any areas with a population of fewer (under current law, non-urban areas with more) than 5,000, and (2) urbanized areas with a population of more than 200,000 that have a high performing MPO.\n\nExtends for FY2015-FY2018 a state's obligational authority to distribute a specified amount of surface transportation program funds for federal-aid highways and highway safety construction programs in urbanized areas with a population over 200,000, including those areas that have a high performing MPO.\n\nMakes permanent a special rule authorizing a state to obligate up to 15% of its apportionment of surface transportation program funds for each fiscal on roads functionally classified as minor collectors in areas of less than 5,000 population.\n\nDefines \"consolidated metropolitan planning organization\" to mean a sole MPO that serves a metropolitan statistical area.\n\nPrescribes requirements for the designation of new and consolidation of multiple MPOs within a metropolitan statistical area.\n\nAllows a MPO for an urbanized area with a population of more than 200,000 to request that the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) designate it as a high performing MPO. Specifies criteria the Secretary shall consider in making such designation.\n\nMakes similar changes to requirements for the transportation alternatives program."
