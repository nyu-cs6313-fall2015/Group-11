<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Responsible Gun 
Sellers Act of 2013''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    Congress makes the following findings:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) Congress supports and respects the right to 
        bear arms found in the Second Amendment to the Constitution of 
        the United States.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) Congress supports the existing prohibition on 
        a national firearms registry.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) There are deficits in the background check 
        system in effect before the date of enactment of this Act and

        with States to swiftly input missing records, including mental 
        health records.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) If the citizens of the United States agree 
        that in order to promote safe and responsible gun ownership 
        criminals and the mentally ill should be prohibited from 
        possessing firearms, it should be incumbent upon all citizens 
        to ensure weapons are not being transferred to such
