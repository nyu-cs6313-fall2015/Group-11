``SEC. 1116. SCHOOL PERFORMANCE.

    ``(a) School Accountability and Improvement System.--
            ``(1) In general.--Each State receiving a grant under this 
        part shall establish a school accountability and improvement 
        system that--

                under section 1111(a)(3) and implements the

                schools under subsection (c), and that are priority 
                schools under subsection (d), and the processes to be 
                used to improve schools in each category, in accordance 
                with this section and section 2123(b).
            ``(2) Review and approval.--The State shall include 
        information describing the school accountability and 
        improvement system in the State plan under section 1111(b), 
        which shall be subject to peer review and approval by the 
        Secretary as part of the State plan, in accordance with such 
        section.

            ``(1) Local interventions.--Beginning in the 2015-2016 
        school year, each local educational agency receiving a subgrant 
        under this part shall--

                consecutive years, has not met the same performance 
                target described in section 1111(a)(3)(C) for the same 
                subgroup described in section 1111(a)(3)(D); and

                student achievement in each such subgroup.
            ``(2) Reporting.--Each local educational agency that 
        implements locally designed interventions under paragraph (1) 
        to support schools that have not met performance targets for a 
        subgroup will report to the State educational agency regarding 
        the resources and interventions used to address the achievement 
        of students in the subgroup, and the outcomes of those efforts. 
        The State educational agency shall annually select the 
        interventions with exemplary outcomes, share such interventions 
        and outcomes with the public, and communicate such 
        interventions and outcomes to the Secretary.

        part that has been identified as a school that has not met the 
        same subgroup performance target, as described in paragraph 
        (1), for the preceding 3 consecutive years shall work with the 
        State educational agency to implement a State-approved 
        intervention based on established best practices within State.

            ``(1) Identification.--Beginning in the 2015-2016 school 
        year, a State shall identify as a focus school, for the 3-year

                        determined by the State academic assessments

                        averages.

        identified under paragraph (1), the local educational agency 
        serving the school shall, in accordance with the State 
        accountability system described in section 1111(a)(3), develop 
        and implement a measurable and data-driven correction plan to 
        improve the performance of low-achieving subgroups in the 
        school in order to close achievement gaps. A correction plan 
        under this paragraph shall be developed with input from 
        teachers, parents, community members, and other stakeholders.

        that would otherwise be considered to be the lowest-achieving 
        10 percent of schools with the greatest achievement gap, or 
        graduation rate gap, under paragraph (1), are actually 
        performing at a satisfactory level of performance, the State 
        may apply to the Secretary to waive the requirements of this 
        subsection with respect to such schools.

        longer identify a school that has been identified as a focus 
        school for any remainder of the school's 3-year identification 
        period if--

                which a school is so identified, the school has met all

                1111(a)(3)(C) for the school year; or

SEC. 4106. STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION.

    Title IV (20 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) is amended by inserting after 
part D, as added by section 4105 of this Act, the following:

                  ``PART E--STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION

``SEC. 4501. SHORT TITLE.

    ``This part may be cited as the `Student Non-Discrimination Act of 
2013'.

``SEC. 4502. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    ``(a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Public school students who are lesbian, gay, 
        bisexual, or transgender (referred to in this part as `LGBT'), 
        or are perceived to be LGBT, or who associate with LGBT people, 
        have been and are subjected to pervasive discrimination, 
        including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, and 
        have been deprived of equal educational opportunities, in 
        schools in every part of the Nation.
            ``(2) While discrimination of any kind is harmful to 
        students and to the education system, actions that target 
        students based on sexual orientation or gender identity 
        represent a distinct and severe problem that remains 
        inadequately addressed by current Federal law.
            ``(3) Numerous social science studies demonstrate that 
        discrimination at school has contributed to high rates of 
        absenteeism, academic underachievement, dropping out, and 
        adverse physical and mental health consequences among LGBT 
        youth.
            ``(4) When left unchecked, discrimination in schools based 
        on sexual orientation or gender identity can lead, and has led, 
        to life-threatening violence and to suicide.
            ``(5) Public school students enjoy a variety of 
        constitutional rights, including rights to equal protection, 
        privacy, and free expression, which are infringed when school 
        officials engage in or fail to take prompt and effective action 
        to stop discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or 
        gender identity.
            ``(6) Provisions of Federal statutory law expressly 
        prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, 
        religion, disability, and national origin. The Department of 
        Education and the Department of Justice, as well as numerous 
        courts, have correctly interpreted the prohibitions on sex 
        discrimination to include discrimination based on sex 
        stereotypes and gender identity, even when that sex-based 
        discrimination coincides or overlaps with discrimination based 
        on sexual orientation. However, the absence of express Federal 
        law prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of sexual 
        orientation and gender identity has created unnecessary 
        uncertainty that risks limiting access to legal remedies under 
        Federal law for LGBT students and their parents.
    ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this part are--
            ``(1) to ensure that all students have access to public 
        education in a safe environment free from discrimination, 
        including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, on 
        the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity;
            ``(2) to provide a comprehensive Federal prohibition of 
        discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived 
        sexual orientation or gender identity;
            ``(3) to provide meaningful and effective remedies for 
        discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived 
        sexual orientation or gender identity;
            ``(4) to invoke congressional powers, including the power 
        to enforce the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and to 
        provide for the general welfare pursuant to section 8 of 
        article I of the Constitution and the power to make all laws 
        necessary and proper for the execution of the foregoing powers 
        pursuant to section 8 of article I of the Constitution, in 
        order to prohibit discrimination in public schools on the basis 
        of sexual orientation or gender identity; and
            ``(5) to allow the Department of Education and the 
        Department of Justice to effectively combat discrimination 
        based on sexual orientation and gender identity in public 
        schools, through regulation and enforcement, as the Departments 
        have issued regulations under and enforced title IX of the 
        Education Amendments of 1972 and other nondiscrimination laws 
        in a manner that effectively addresses discrimination.

        person's opposition to conduct made unlawful by this part.
            ``(2) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, 
        `opposition to conduct made unlawful by this part' includes--

                    ``(B) any formal or informal report, whether oral

``SEC. 7202. FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous 
        people with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants 
        of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was organized as a 
        nation and internationally recognized as a nation by the United 
        States, and many other countries.
            ``(2) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-
        based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty 
        over the Hawaiian Islands.
            ``(3) The political relationship between the United States 
        and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and 
        reaffirmed by the United States, as evidenced by the inclusion 
        of Native Hawaiians in many Federal statutes.
            ``(4) In 1993, 2005, and 2009, the Kamehameha Schools 
        Bishop Estate released the findings of the Native Hawaiian 
        Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the 
        successes of the programs established under title IV of the 
        Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary 
        School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the same 
        educational needs still existed for Native Hawaiians.
            ``(5) The percentage of Native Hawaiian students served by 
        the State of Hawaii Department of Education rose 30 percent 
        from 1980 to 2008, and there are and will continue to be 
        geographically rural, isolated areas with a high Native 
        Hawaiian population density.
            ``(6) The Native Hawaiian people are determined to 
        preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their 
        ancestral territory and their cultural identity in accordance 
        with their own spiritual and traditional beliefs, customs, 
        practices, language, and social institutions.
            ``(7) The State of Hawaii, in the constitution and statutes 
        of the State of Hawaii--
                    ``(A) reaffirms and protects the unique right of 
                the Native Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate 
                their culture and religious customs, beliefs, 
                practices, and language;
                    ``(B) recognizes the traditional language of the 
                Native Hawaiian people as an official language of the 
                State of Hawaii, which may be used as the language of 
                instruction for all subjects and grades in the public 
                school system; and
                    ``(C) promotes the study of the Hawaiian culture, 
                language, and history by providing a Hawaiian education 
                program and using community expertise as a suitable and 
                essential means to further the program.''.

                   Subpart 2--Alaska Native Education

SEC. 7301. ALASKA NATIVE EDUCATION.

    Subpart 2 of part B of title VII (20 U.S.C. 7541 et seq.), as 
amended by section 7201, is further amended by striking sections 7301 
through 7306 and inserting the following:

``SEC. 7301. SHORT TITLE.

    ``This subpart may be cited as the `Alaska Native Educational 
Equity, Support, and Assistance Act'.

``SEC. 7302. FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) The attainment of educational success is critical to 
        the betterment of the conditions, long-term well-being, and 
        preservation of the culture and languages of Alaska Natives.
            ``(2) It is the policy of the Federal Government to 
        encourage the maximum participation by Alaska Natives in the 
        planning and the management of Alaska Native education programs 
        and to support efforts developed by and undertaken within the 
        Alaska Native community to improve educational opportunity for 
        all students.
            ``(3) Alaska Native children enter and exit school with 
        serious educational handicaps.
            ``(4) The educational achievement of Alaska Native children 
        is far below national norms. Alaska Native performance on 
        standardized tests is low, Alaska Native student dropout rates 
        are high, Natives are significantly underrepresented among 
        holders of baccalaureate degrees in the State of Alaska, and 
        Alaska Natives are more likely than other Alaskans to be 
        without access to employment. As a result, Alaska Native 
        students are being denied their opportunity to become full 
        participants in society and an entire generation is being 
        condemned to an underclass status and a life of limited 
        choices.
            ``(5) The programs and activities authorized under this 
        subpart are essential if educational handicaps are to be 
        overcome.
            ``(6) The sheer magnitude of the geographic and other 
        barriers to be overcome in delivering educational services in 
        rural Alaska and Alaska villages should be addressed through 
        the development and implementation of innovative, model 
        programs in a variety of areas.
            ``(7) Alaska Native children should be afforded the 
        opportunity to begin their formal education on a par with their 
        non-Native peers. The Federal Government should lend support to 
        efforts developed by and undertaken within the Alaska Native 
        community to improve educational opportunity for all students.
            ``(8) In 1983, pursuant to Public Law 98-63 (97 Stat. 326), 
        Alaska ceased to receive educational funding from the Bureau of 
        Indian Affairs.

``SEC. 7303. PURPOSES.

    ``The purposes of this subpart are as follows:
            ``(1) To address the critical need to meet the unique 
        educational needs of Alaska Natives.
            ``(2) To authorize the development and expansion of 
        effective supplemental educational programs to benefit Alaska 
        Natives.
            ``(3) To supplement existing programs and authorities in 
        the area of education to further the purposes of this subpart.
            ``(4) To provide direction and guidance to appropriate 
        Federal, State, and local agencies to focus resources, 
        including resources made available under this subpart, on 
        meeting the educational needs of Alaska Natives.
            ``(5) To ensure the maximum participation by Alaska Natives 
        in the planning and management of programs designed to serve 
        Alaska Natives.
