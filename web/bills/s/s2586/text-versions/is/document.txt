SEC. 2. SECURE MEDICARE CARD PILOT PROGRAM.

    (a) Pilot Program Implementation (Phase I).--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall conduct a pilot 
        program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act for the 
        purpose of utilizing smart card technology for Medicare 
        beneficiary and provider identification cards in order to--
                    (A) increase the quality of care furnished to 
                Medicare beneficiaries;
                    (B) improve the accuracy and efficiency in the 
                billing for Medicare items and services furnished by 
                Medicare providers;
                    (C) reduce the potential for identity theft and 
                other unlawful use of Medicare beneficiary and provider 
                identifying information; and
                    (D) reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare 
                program.
            (2) Site requirements.--The Secretary shall conduct the 
        pilot program in at least 5 geographic areas in which the 
        Secretary determines there is a high risk for waste, fraud, or 
        abuse.
            (3) Design of pilot program.--In designing the pilot 
        program, the Secretary shall provide for the following:
                    (A) Implementation of a system that utilizes a 
                smart card as a Medicare identification card for 
                Medicare beneficiaries and Medicare providers. Such a 
                card shall contain appropriate security features and 
                protect personal privacy.
                    (B) Issuance of a new smart card to all Medicare 
                beneficiaries participating in the pilot program. Such 
                card shall not have the Social Security number printed 
                on the front but, instead shall have such number stored 
                securely on the smart card chip along with other 
                information the Secretary deems necessary.
                    (C) Issuance of a new provider card to all Medicare 
                providers participating in the pilot program. Such card 
                shall include a photograph of the provider and shall 
                not have the Medicare provider number printed on the 
                front of the card but, instead shall have such number 
                stored securely on the smart card chip along with other 
                information the Secretary deems necessary.
                    (D) A process for enrollment of all Medicare 
                providers that includes--
                            (i) identity and certification 
                        verification; and
                            (ii) utilization of biometric data, such as 
                        fingerprints, for provider identification and 
                        authentication.
                    (E) A process under which the cards issued under 
                subparagraphs (B) and (C) are used by both Medicare 
                beneficiaries and Medicare providers to verify 
                eligibility, prevent fraud, and authorize transactions.
                    (F) Distribution of necessary equipment, including 
                cards, card readers, kiosks, biometric readers, and 
                other materials or documents to Medicare beneficiaries 
                and providers at no cost to them.
                    (G) Regular monitoring and review by the Secretary 
                of Medicare providers' Medicare billings and Medicare 
                beneficiaries' Medicare records in order to identify 
                and address inaccurate charges and instances of waste, 
                fraud, or abuse.
                    (H) Reporting mechanisms for measuring the cost 
                savings to the Medicare program by reason of the pilot 
                program.
