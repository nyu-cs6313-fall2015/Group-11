  <summary>6/30/2014--Public Law.
Reliable Home Heating Act - Directs the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to recognize any 30-day emergency period declared by a state governor due to a shortage of residential heating fuel (and up to two additional 30-day periods) as one during which FMCSA federal motor carrier safety regulations shall not apply to any motor carrier or driver operating a commercial motor vehicle providing residential heating fuel in a geographic area designated as under a state of emergency.

Defines the term "residential heating fuel" to include heating oil, natural gas, and propane.

Directs the Administrator of the Energy Information Administration, using data compiled from the Administration's Weekly Petroleum Status Reports, to notify the governor of each state in a Petroleum Administration for Defense District if that district's inventory of residential heating fuel has been below the most recent five-year average for more than three consecutive weeks. Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to study the impacts on safety from the extension of exemptions issued by the state governors.</summary>
