    (a) Multilateral Negotiations.--In order to further the objective 
of section 301, Congress urges the President to commence immediately 
diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate international fora such as the

establish a multilateral sanctions regime against Syria that will 
inhibit the efforts of the Government of Syria to develop and obtain 
conventional weapons and to use those and other weapons against the 
people of Syria.
    (b) Periodic Reports to Congress.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of
