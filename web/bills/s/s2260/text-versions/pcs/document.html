        2016;

        process, to eliminate temporary provisions from the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986 by making permanent those provisions that 
        merit permanency and allowing others to expire;
            (3) a major focus of such tax reform process should be 
        fostering economic growth and lowering tax rates by broadening 
        the tax base; and
            (4) the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on 
        Finance of the Senate should consult with the chairman and 
        ranking member of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate to 
        ensure that the appropriate baseline is used in determining the 
        economic effects of, and rate adjustments under, tax reform.
