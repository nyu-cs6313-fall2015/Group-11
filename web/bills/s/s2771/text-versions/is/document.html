SEC. 101. WATER EFFICIENCY, CONSERVATION, AND ADAPTATION.

    (a) WaterSense.--
            (1) In general.--There is established within the 
        Environmental Protection Agency a WaterSense program to 
        identify and promote water efficient products, buildings, 
        landscapes, facilities, processes, and services so as--
                    (A) to reduce water use;
                    (B) to reduce the strain on water, wastewater, and 
                stormwater infrastructure;
                    (C) to conserve energy used to pump, heat, 
                transport, and treat water; and
                    (D) to preserve water resources for future 
                generations, through voluntary labeling of, or other 
                forms of communications about, products, buildings, 
                landscapes, facilities, processes, and services that 
                meet the highest water efficiency and performance 
                criteria.
            (2) Duties.--The Administrator shall--
                    (A) establish--
                            (i) a WaterSense label to be used for 
                        certain items; and
                            (ii) the procedure by which an item may be 
                        certified to display the WaterSense label;
                    (B) promote WaterSense-labeled products, buildings, 
                landscapes, facilities, processes, and services in the 
                marketplace as the preferred technologies and services 
                for--
                            (i) reducing water use; and
                            (ii) ensuring product and service 
                        performance;
                    (C) work to enhance public awareness of the 
                WaterSense label through public outreach, education, 
                and other means;
                    (D) preserve the integrity of the WaterSense label 
                by--
                            (i) establishing and maintaining 
                        performance criteria so that products, 
                        buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, 
                        and services labeled with the WaterSense label 
                        perform as well or better than less water-
                        efficient counterparts;
                            (ii) overseeing WaterSense certifications 
                        made by third parties;
                            (iii) conducting reviews of the use of the 
                        WaterSense label in the marketplace and taking 
                        corrective action in any case in which misuse 
                        of the label is identified; and
                            (iv) carrying out such other measures as 
                        the Administrator determines to be appropriate;
                    (E) regularly review and, if appropriate, update 
                WaterSense criteria for categories of products,

                    (F) to the maximum extent practicable, regularly 
                estimate and make available to the public the

                savings of water, energy, and capital costs of water, 
                wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure attributable 
                to the use of WaterSense-labeled products, buildings, 
                landscapes, facilities, processes, and services, at 
                least annually;
                    (G) solicit comments from interested parties and

                specification, installation criterion, or other 
                criterion, taking into account the timing requirements 
                of the manufacturing, marketing, training, and 
                distribution process for the specific product, building 
                and landscape, or service category addressed;
                    (J) identify and, if appropriate, implement other

                served by the eligible entity during the most recent 
                calendar year for which data are available and the 
                availability or reliability of water supplies to the 
                eligible entity.
            (4) Use of allocated funds.--Funds allocated to an eligible 
        entity under paragraph (3) may be used to pay up to 50 percent
