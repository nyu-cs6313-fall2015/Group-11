                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for the participation 
  of particular specialists determined by the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services to be directly related to the health needs stemming from 
  environmental health hazards that have led to its declaration as a 
   Public Health Emergency to be eligible under the National Health 
   Service Corps in the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment 
                    Program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Health Emergencies Lack Provider 
Specialists Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings
            (1) In communities facing environmental health hazards that 
        have been declared a public health emergency (pursuant to 
        section 104(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
        Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980), it is increasingly 
        difficult for the health care facilities in those areas to 
        recruit the specialists necessary to treat the particular 
        health needs of the residents. As a result, these communities 
        and their populations are medically underserved.
            (2) Since 1970, the National Health Service Corps has 
        helped communities recruit health care professionals who are 
        committed to serving the needs of underserved populations.
