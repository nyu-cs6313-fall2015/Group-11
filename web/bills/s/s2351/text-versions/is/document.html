following new paragraph:
            ``(2) Requirement of notice.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Not later than 300 days after 
                the date an organization described in paragraph (1) 
                fails to file the annual return or notice referenced in 
                paragraph (1) for 2 consecutive years, the Secretary 
                shall notify the organization--
                            ``(i) that the Internal Revenue Service has 
                        no record of such a return or notice from such 
                        organization for 2 consecutive years, and
                            ``(ii) about the penalty that will occur 
                        under this subsection if the organization fails 
                        to file such a return or notice by the date of 
                        the next filing deadline.
                The notification under the preceding sentence shall 
                include information about how to comply with the filing 
                requirements under subsections (a)(1) and (i).''.
    (b) Reinstatement Without Application.--Paragraph (3) of section 
6033(j) of such Code, as redesignated under subsection (a), is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``Any organization'' and inserting the 
        following:
                    ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), any organization'', and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:
                    ``(B) Retroactive reinstatement without application 
                if actual notice not provided.--If an organization 
                described in paragraph (1)--
                            ``(i) demonstrates to the satisfaction of 
                        the Secretary that the organization did not 
                        receive the notice required under paragraph 
                        (2), and
                            ``(ii) files an annual return or notice 
                        referenced in paragraph (1) for the current 
                        year,
                then the Secretary may reinstate the organization's 
                exempt status effective from the date of the revocation 
                under paragraph (1) without the need for an 
                application.''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to notices and returns required to be filed after December 31,
