Prohibits the obligation or expenditure of any Department of Defense (DOD) funds to retire, prepare to retire, or place in storage any A-10 aircraft until: (1) the Secretary of the Air Force certifies that the F-35A aircraft has achieved full operational capability and Block 4A capabilities and that a sufficient number of F-35A aircraft exists in the Air Force inventory to replace the A-10 aircraft in order to meet close air support capability requirements of the combatant commands; and (2) the Comptroller General submits a report that assesses whether each such certification is comprehensive, fully supported, and sufficiently detailed and that identifies any shortcomings, limitations, or other reportable matters that affect the quality or findings of any such certification.</summary>
