Prohibits the Secretary from paying more than $60,000 on behalf of an individual for each year of obligated service the individual agrees to serve.\n\nDirects the Comptroller General (GAO) to conduct a study of pay disparities among VHA psychiatrists.\n\nAuthorizes the Secretary to carry out a pilot program providing a monthly housing allowance to individuals who: (1) are health care providers, (2) are or agree to become VHA employees on a full-time basis in a health care position designated by the Secretary, and (3) accept an assignment in such position for at least 36 months at a rural or highly rural community-based outpatient clinic selected by the Secretary.\n\nProvides bonus housing allowances to participants who complete the 36 months of service and to those who complete additional one-year or two-year terms of service."
