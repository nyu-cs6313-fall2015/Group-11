Prohibits volunteers from providing personal care or administering prescription medications.\n\nAllows the Secretary to award grants for the operation of local Corps programs.\n\nRequires local Corps programs to screen, train, and supervise volunteers.\n\nDirects local Corps programs to appropriately recognize volunteers.
