        permitted under State law, a State educational agency may 
        allocate grant funds under this subpart among the local 
        educational agencies in the State based on the formula 
        described in paragraph (2).
            ``(2) Formula.--A State educational agency may allocate 
        grant funds under this subpart for a fiscal year among the 
        local educational agencies in the State in proportion to the 
        number of eligible children enrolled in public schools served 
        by the local educational agency and enrolled in State-
        accredited private schools within the local educational 
        agency's geographic jurisdiction, for the most recent fiscal 
        year for which satisfactory data are available, compared to the 
        number of such children in all such local educational agencies 
        for that fiscal year.
    ``(b) Eligible Child.--
            ``(1) In general.--In this section, the term `eligible 
        child' means a child--
                    ``(A) from a family with an income below the 
                poverty level, on the basis of the most recent 
                satisfactory data published by the Department of 
                Commerce; and
                    ``(B) who resides in an Economic Freedom Zone as 
                designated under title II of the Economic Freedom Zones 
                Act of 2013.
            ``(2) Criteria of poverty.--In determining the families 
        with incomes below the poverty level for the purposes of 
        paragraph (2), a State educational agency shall use the 
        criteria of poverty used by the Census Bureau in compiling the 
        most recent decennial census.
            ``(3) Identification of eligible children.--On an annual 
        basis, on a date to be determined by the State educational 
        agency, each local educational agency that receives grant 
        funding in accordance with subsection (a) shall inform the 
        State educational agency of the number of eligible children 
        enrolled in public schools served by the local educational 
        agency and enrolled in State-accredited private schools within 
        the local educational agency's geographic jurisdiction.
    ``(c) Distribution to Schools.--Each local educational agency that 
receives grant funding under subsection (a) shall distribute such funds 
to the public schools served by the local educational agency and State-
accredited private schools with the local educational agency's 
geographic jurisdiction--
            ``(1) based on the number of eligible children enrolled in 
        such schools; and
            ``(2) in the manner that would, in the absence of such 
        Federal funds, supplement the funds made available from the 
        non-Federal resources for the education of pupils participating 
        in programs under this part, and not to supplant such funds.''.

         TITLE VII--STATE AND COMMUNITY POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

SEC. 701. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS.

    It is the sense of the Senate that State and local governments 
should review and adopt the following policy recommendations:
            (1) Pension reform.--State and local governments should--
                    (A) implement reforms to address any fiscal 
                shortfall in public pension funding, including 
                utilizing accrual accounting methods, such as those 
                reforms undertaken by the private sector pension funds; 
                and
                    (B) restructure and renegotiate any public pension 
                fund that is deemed to be insolvent or underfunded, 
                including adopting defined contribution retirement 
                systems.
            (2) Taxes.--State and local governments should reduce 
        jurisdictional tax rates below the national average in order to 
        help facilitate capital investment and economic growth, 
        particularly in combination with the provisions of this Act.
            (3) Education.--State and local governments should adopt 
        school choice options to provide children and parents more 
        educational choices, particularly in impoverished areas.
            (4) Communities.--State and local governments should adopt 
        right-to-work laws to allow more competitiveness and more 
        flexibility for businesses to expand.
            (5) Regulations.--State and local governments should 
        streamline the regulatory burden on families and businesses, 
        including streamlining the opportunities for occupational 
        licensing.
            (6) Abandoned structures.--State and local governments 
        should consider the following options to reduce or fix areas 
        with abandoned properties or residences:
                    (A) In the case of foreclosures, tax notifications 
                should be sent to both the lien holder (if different 
                than the homeowner) and the homeowner.
                    (B) Where State constitutions permit, property tax 
                abatement or credits should be provided for individuals 
                who purchase or invest in abandoned or dilapidated 
                properties.
                    (C) Non-profit or charity demolition entities 
                should be permitted or encouraged to help remove 
                abandoned properties.
                    (D) Government or municipality fees and penalties 
                should be limited, and be proportional to the 
                outstanding tax amount and the ability to pay.
                    (E) The sale of tax liens to third parties should 
                be reviewed, and where available, should prohibit the 
                selling of tax liens below a certain threshold (for 
                example the prohibition of the sale of tax liens to 
                third parties under $1,000).
                                 &lt;all&gt;
</pre></body></html>
