To prohibit certain foreign assistance to the Government of Egypt as a 
           result of the July 3, 2013, military coup d'etat.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Egyptian Military Coup Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. FOREIGN ASSISTANCE RESTRICTIONS IN RESPONSE TO EGYPTIAN 
              MILITARY COUP D'ETAT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On June 30, 2012, Mohamed Morsi was elected President 
        of Egypt in elections that were certified as free and fair by 
        the Egyptian Presidential Election Commission and the United 
        Nations.
            (2) On July 3, 2013, the military of Egypt removed the 
        democratically elected President of Egypt, arrested his 
        supporters, and suspended the Constitution of Egypt. These 
        actions fit the definition of a military coup d'etat.
            (3) On August 14, 2013, Egyptian security forces killed 
        over 600 protestors in the dispersal of a demonstration in 
        Rabaa, Egypt.
            (4) Since the July 2013 military coup d'etat, the Egyptian 
        military and security officials are estimated to have killed 
        more than 1,000 Egyptian citizen protestors.
            (5) On January 17, 2014, President Barack Obama signed into 
        law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (Public Law 113-
        76), which included language in section 7041(a) that 
        conditioned economic assistance to the Government of Egypt on 
        concrete and measurable actions to restore democracy to the 
        citizens of Egypt.
            (6) On April 23, 2014, President Obama approved the 
        transfer of 10 AH-64 Apache Helicopters and $650,000,000 in 
        financial aid to the military-controlled Government of Egypt.
            (7) On April 28, 2014, a court in Egypt sentenced 683 
        Egyptian citizens to death for protests in the town of Edwa, 
        Egypt, following a five-minute hearing that was not long enough 
        to recite the full names of the accused.
            (8) On May 5, 2014, Former Army Chief Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, 
        who led Egyptian military forces in the coup d'etat against a 
        ruling party that was elected with 51.7 percent of the vote, 
        said on Egyptian television that, if elected, the previous 
        ruling political party would ``not exist''.
            (9) On May 6, 2014, a court in Egypt banned members of the 
        National Democratic Party from participating in any 
        Presidential, parliamentary, or local elections.
            (10) Pursuant to section 7008 of the Department of State, 
        Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Act, 2012 (division I 
        of Public Law 112-74; 125 Stat. 1195), the United States is 
        legally prohibited from providing foreign assistance to any 
        country whose duly elected head of government is deposed by a 
        military coup d'etat, or removed in such a way that the 
        military plays a decisive role.
            (11) The United States has suspended aid to countries that 
        have undergone military coups d'etat in the past, including the 
        Ivory Coast, the Central African Republic, Thailand, Mali, 
        Fiji, and Honduras.
    (b) Foreign Assistance to the Government of Egypt.--
            (1) Restrictions on assistance under section 7008.--In 
        accordance with section 7008 of the Department of State, 
        Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Act, 2012 (division I 
        of Public Law 112-74; 125 Stat. 1195), the United States 
        Government, including the Department of State, shall refrain 
        from providing to the Government of Egypt the assistance 
        restricted under such section.
            (2) Additional restrictions.--In addition to the 
        restrictions referred to in paragraph (1), the following 
        restrictions shall be in effect with respect to United States 
        assistance to the Government of Egypt:

                for transfer to Egyptian Ministry of Defense (MOD) and 
                Ministry of Interior (MOI) shall be suspended until the 
                President certifies to Congress that democratic 
                national elections have taken place in Egypt followed 
                by a peaceful transfer of power.
                    (B) Provision of defense services to Egyptian MOD 
                and MOI shall be halted immediately until the President 
                certifies to Congress that democratic national 
                elections have taken place in Egypt followed by a 
                peaceful transfer of power.
                    (C) Processing of draft Letters of Offer and 
                Acceptance (LOAs) for future arms sales to Egyptian MOD 
                and MOI entities shall be halted until the President 
                certifies to Congress that democratic national 
                elections have taken place in Egypt followed by a 
                peaceful transfer of power.
                    (D) All costs associated with the delays in 
                deliveries and provision of services required under 
                subparagraphs (A) through (C) shall be borne by the 
                Government of Egypt.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
