Requires the Secretary to: (1) inspect such facilities at least annually, and (2) notify Congress of any such revocation and termination of per diem payments.\n\nRequires the Secretary's annual report on assistance to homeless veterans to include an evaluation of the safety and accessibility of such providers' facilities.\n\nDirects the Secretary to assess the compliance of the building and housing and services provided by current per diem payment recipients. Prohibits additional payments to a recipient that is not, within two years after enactment of this Act, certified to be in compliance until the Secretary certifies that the building and housing and services provided are in compliance."
