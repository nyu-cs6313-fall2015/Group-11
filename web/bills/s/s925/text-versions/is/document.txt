To improve the Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lower East Side Tenement National 
Historic Site Improvement Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Lower East Side Tenement Museum (referred to in 
        this section as the ``Museum'') was founded in 1988 and has, 
        for the past 25 years, preserved and interpreted the history of 
        immigration through the personal experiences of generations of 
        newcomers who settled in and built lives on Manhattan's Lower 
        East Side, the iconic immigrant neighborhood of the United 
        States;
            (2) the Director of the National Park Service found the 
        Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street to be nationally 
        significant;
            (3) the Secretary of the Interior designated the Lower East 
        Side Tenement a National Historic Landmark on April 19, 1994;
            (4) the Director of the National Park Service, through a 
        special resource study, found the Lower East Side Tenement 
        suitable and feasible for inclusion in the National Park 
        System;
            (5) Congress designated the Lower East Side Tenement at 97 
        Orchard Street as a national historic site and as an affiliated 
        site of the National Park System in title I of Public Law 105-
        378 (112 Stat. 3395);
            (6) the National Park Service prepared a General Management 
        Plan (referred to in this section as the ``Plan'') for the site 
        in 2006;
            (7) the Plan recognized the need for space for 
        administrative functions, collections storage, and visitor 
        services, including orientation and additional exhibits;
            (8) the Museum obtained a neighboring 1888 tenement, 103 
        Orchard Street, which was restored and renovated to serve as a 
        visitor and education center; and
            (9) 103 Orchard was declared a contributing property in the 
        Lower East Side National Historic District listed on both the 
        National and New York State Registers of Historic Places.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to include 103 Orchard Street in New York City as part 
        of the Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site;
            (2) to ensure the preservation, maintenance, and 
        interpretation of the expanded site;
            (3) to interpret at the site the stories of Holocaust 
        survivors, Puerto Rican migrants, and post-1965 Chinese 
        immigrants;
            (4) to enhance appreciation for the profound role 
        immigration has played and continues to play in shaping the 
        evolving national identity of the United States; and
            (5) to ensure continued interpretation of the nationally 
        significant immigrant phenomenon associated with the Lower East 
        Side of New York City and the role of the Lower East Side in 
        the history of immigration to the United States, and to enhance 
        the interpretation of the Castle Clinton, Ellis Island, and 
        Statue of Liberty National Monuments.
