Ratifies and confirms any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to the Act for any Indian tribe that was federally recognized on the date of the action.\n\n Directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the effects of Carcieri v. Salazar on Indian tribes and tribal land. Requires the Secretary to publish a list of each Indian tribe and parcel of tribal land affected by that decision in the Federal Register and on the Department of the Interior's website."
