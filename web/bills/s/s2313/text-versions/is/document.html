                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit congressional recesses until Congress adopts a concurrent 
 resolution on the budget that results in a balanced federal budget by 
     fiscal year 2024 and to control congressional travel budgets.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Do Your Job Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Federal debt exceeds $17,000,000,000,000 and 
        continues to grow.
            (2) It is the responsibility of Members of Congress to 
        enact and implement policies that encourage economic growth and 
        job creation, including a balanced budget.
            (3) In 2013, the House of Representatives was in session 
        only 160 days and the Senate was in session only 156 days.
            (4) This means that, according to Federal Reserve Economic 
        Data, the average American works 10 more weeks per year than 
        Congress is in session.
            (5) Congressional recess in a time of excessive national 
        debt is a lost opportunity to reach agreement about a balanced 
        budget.

SEC. 3. NO CONGRESSIONAL RECESSES.

    (a) In General.--During the period beginning on the date of 
enactment of this Act and ending on the date specified in subsection 
(b), neither the Senate nor the House of Representatives may recess or 
stand adjourned for a period of longer than 24 hours.
    (b) Balanced Budget Agreed to.--The date described in this 
subsection is the date of enactment of a concurrent resolution on the 
budget that establishes a level of deficit of $0 or a surplus by not 
later than fiscal year 2024.
    (c) Rules of House of Representatives and Senate.--This section is 
enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, and it 
        supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is 
        inconsistent with such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.

        Congress (or a subcommittee thereof); or
            (3) a leadership office of the Senate or the House of 
        Representatives.
    (b) Submission of Budget.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than the date by which the

                Secretary of the Senate; and
                    (B) in the case of a Member of the House of 
                Representatives, shall be submitted to the Chief 
                Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives.
    (c) Rescission of Unspent Travel Funds.--Effective on October 1 of
