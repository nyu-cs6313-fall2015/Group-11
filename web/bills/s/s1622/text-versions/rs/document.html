                                 A BILL


 
 To establish the Alyce Spotted Bear and Walter Soboleff Commission on 
                Native Children, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Alyce Spotted Bear and 
Walter Soboleff Commission on Native Children Act''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the United States has a distinct legal, 
        treaty, and trust obligation to provide for the education, 
        health care, safety, social welfare, and other needs of Native 
        children;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) chronic underfunding of Federal programs to 
        fulfill the longstanding Federal trust obligation has resulted 
        in limited access to critical services for the more than 
        2,100,000 Native children under the age of 24 living in the 
        United States;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Native children are the most at-risk 
        population in the United States, confronting serious 
        disparities in education, health, and safety, with 37 percent 
        living in poverty;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) 17 percent of Native children have no health 
        insurance coverage, and child mortality has increased 15 
        percent among Native children aged 1 to 14, while the overall 
        rate of child mortality in the United States decreased by 9 
        percent;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) suicide is the second leading cause of death 
        in Native children aged 15 through 24, a rate that is 2.5 times 
        the national average, and violence, including intentional 
        injuries, homicide, and suicide, account for 75 percent of the 
        deaths of Native children aged 12 through 20;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) 58 percent of 3- and 4-year-old Native 
        children are not attending any form of preschool, 15 percent of 
        Native children are not in school and not working, and the 
        graduation rate for Native high school students is 50 
        percent;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) 22.9 percent of Native children aged 12 and 
        older report alcohol use, 16 percent report substance 
        dependence or abuse, 35.8 percent report tobacco use, and 12.5 
        percent report illicit drug use;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) Native children disproportionately enter 
        foster care at a rate more than 2.1 times the general 
        population and have the third highest rate of victimization; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) there is no resource that is more vital to the 
        continued existence and integrity of Native communities than 
        Native children, and the United States has a direct interest, 
        as trustee, in protecting Native children.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                children;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (E) the barriers to the development of 
                sustainable, multidisciplinary programs designed to 
                assist high-risk Native children and families of those 
                high-risk Native children, as well as any examples of 
                successful program models and use of best practices; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) the barriers to interagency 
                coordination on programs benefitting Native 
                children.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Coordination.--In conducting the study under 
        paragraph (1), to avoid duplication of efforts, the Commission 
        shall, to the maximum extent practicable, collaborate with 
        other workgroups focused on similar issues, such as the Task 
        Force on American Indian/Alaska Native Children Exposed to 
        Violence of the Attorney General.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Recommendations.--Taking into consideration 
        the results of the study under paragraph (1) and the analysis 
        of any existing data relating to Native children received from 
        Federal agencies, the Commission shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) develop goals, and plans for achieving 
                those goals, for Federal policy relating to Native 
                children in the short-, mid-, and long-term, which 
                shall be informed by the development of accurate child 
                well-being measures;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) make recommendations on necessary 
                modifications and improvements to programs that serve 
                Native children at the Federal, State, and tribal level 
                that integrate the cultural strengths of the 
                communities of the Native children and will result in--
                &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) improvements to the child 
                        welfare system that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (I) reduce the 
                                disproportionate rate at which Native 
                                children enter child protective 
                                services and the period of time spent 
                                in the foster system;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (II) increase coordination 
                                among social workers, police, and 
                                foster families assisting Native 
                                children while in the foster system to 
                                result in the increased safety of 
                                Native children while in the foster 
                                system;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (III) encourage the hiring 
                                and retention of licensed social 
                                workers in Native 
                                communities;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (IV) address the lack of 
                                available foste
