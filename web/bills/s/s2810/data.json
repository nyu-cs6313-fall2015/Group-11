Identifies that information as military service and separation data and specified contact information.\n\nRequires the member's consent before that information may be shared.\n\nDirects the Secretary to ensure that the state veterans agencies only share such information with county veterans service offices for such purposes as the Secretary specifies for the administration and delivery of benefits."
