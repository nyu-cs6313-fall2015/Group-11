        command climate is an appropriate basis for relief from their 
        command positions; and

        officers on their performance in establishing a command climate 
        as described in paragraph (1) during the regular periodic 
        counseling and performance appraisal process prescribed by the 
        Armed Force concerned for inclusion in the systems of records

        occurs in the United States with respect to the victim's 
        preference as to whether the offense should be prosecuted by 
        court-martial or by a civilian court with jurisdiction over the 
        offense.
            (2) Weight afforded preference.--The preference expressed 
        by a victim under paragraph (1) with respect to the prosecution 
        of an offense, while not binding, should be afforded great

        Secretaries of the military departments shall each ensure that 
        the performance appraisals of commanding officers under the 
        jurisdiction of such Secretary indicate the extent to which 
        each such commanding officer has or has not established a 
        command climate in which--
                    (A) allegations of sexual assault are properly 
                managed and fairly evaluated; and

        and the command of the victim. If the accused and the victim 
        are within the same command, only a single climate assessment 
        is required. The process shall ensure the timely completion of

of Victims of Sexual Offenses.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretaries of the military 
        departments shall each establish a confidential process, 
        through boards for the correction of military records of the 
        military department concerned, by which an individual who was 
        the victim of a covered sexual offense during service in the 
        Armed Forces may challenge, on the basis of being the victim of 
        such an offense, the terms or characterization of the 
        individual's discharge or separation from the Armed Forces.
            (2) Consideration of individual experiences in connection 
        with offenses.--In deciding whether to modify the terms or 
        characterization of an individual's discharge or separation 
        pursuant to the process required by paragraph (1), the 
        Secretary of the military department concerned shall instruct 
        boards to give due consideration to the psychological and

              SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OFFENSES UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF 
              MILITARY JUSTICE THROUGH COURTS-MARTIAL.

    (a) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) any charge regarding an offense specified in subsection 
        (b) should be disposed of by court-martial, rather than by non-
        judicial punishment or administrative action; and
            (2) in the case of any charge regarding an offense 
        specified in subsection (b) that is disposed of by non-judicial 
        punishment or administrative action, rather than by court-
        martial, the disposition authority should include in the case 
        file a justification for the disposition of the charge by non-
        judicial punishment or administrative action, rather than by 
        court-martial.
    (b) Covered Offenses.--An offense specified in this subsection is 
any of the following offenses under chapter 47 of title 10, United 
States Code (the Uniform Code of Military Justice):

              MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES WHO COMMIT SEXUAL-RELATED 
              OFFENSES.

    It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Armed Forces should be sparing in discharging in 
        lieu of court-martial members of the Armed Forces who have 
        committed rape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy, or attempts to 
        commit such offenses, and should do so only when the facts of 
        the case clearly warrant such discharge;
            (2) whenever possible, the victims of offenses referred to 
        in paragraph (1) should be consulted prior to the determination 
        regarding whether to discharge the members who committed such 
        offenses;
            (3) commanding officers should consider the views of 
        victims of offenses referred to in paragraph (1) when 
        determining whether to discharge the members who committed such 
        offenses in lieu of trying such members by court-martial; and
            (4) the discharge of any member who is discharged as 
        described in paragraph (1) should be characterized as Other 
        Than Honorable.
