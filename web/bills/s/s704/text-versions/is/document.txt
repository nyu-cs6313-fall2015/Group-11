SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Rachel Carson Nature Trail 
Designation Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that Rachel Carson--
            (1) was born on May 27, 1907, on a farm in Springdale, 
        Pennsylvania, graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's 
        degree in biology from the Pennsylvania College for Women 
        (later Chatham College), and was awarded a full scholarship 
        that enabled her to obtain a master's degree in marine zoology 
        from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore;
            (2) was a world-renowned environmental scientist, writer, 
        and educator;
            (3) worked as a writer, editor, and ultimately Editor-in-
        Chief for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's publications 
        department;
            (4) published the groundbreaking book Silent Spring in 
        September 1962, which was translated into more than a dozen 
        foreign languages and inspired the environmental movement;
            (5) used the National Park Service's Glover Archbold Park 
        in the District of Columbia for her observations and study of 
        nature and the environment;
            (6) accomplished much of her professional work at the 
        United States Department of the Interior in the District of 
        Columbia;
            (7) performed research on pesticides, the findings of which 
        were sustained by a Science Advisory Committee appointed during 
        President John F. Kennedy's administration, and resulted in 
        State legislatures enacting pesticide-regulating legislation;
            (8) was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and 
        Letters and received many other honors;
            (9) passed away on April 14, 1964, in Silver Spring, 
        Maryland; and
            (10) leaves a rich legacy that will continue to benefit 
        present and future generations well beyond the 50th anniversary 
        of Silent Spring in September 2012.
