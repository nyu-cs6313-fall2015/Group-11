        intends to address with a rule.
            ``(3) Whether existing Federal laws or rules have created 
        or contributed to the problem the agency may address with a 
        rule and, if so, whether those Federal laws or rules could be 
        amended or rescinded to address the problem in whole or in 
        part.
            ``(4) A reasonable number of alternatives for a new rule, 
        including any substantial alternatives or other responses 
        identified by interested persons.

        agency determines to initiate a rulemaking that may result in a 
        major rule or high-impact rule, the agency shall--
                    ``(A) establish an electronic docket for that 
                rulemaking, which may have a physical counterpart; and

        docket and made accessible to the public.
    ``(d) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.--
            ``(1) In general.--If an agency determines that the 
        objectives of the agency require the agency to issue a rule,

        Information and Regulatory Affairs and publish a notice of 
        proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register, which shall

        hearing held under this subsection, the agency shall publish in 
        the Federal Register a notice specifying the proposed rule to 
        be considered at the hearing and the factual issues to be 
        considered at the hearing.

                petition or petitions granted in whole or in part under 
                paragraph (1) and any other factual issues the 
                resolution of which the agency, in its discretion, 
                determines will advance its consideration of the

                hearing held under this subsection. Any documentary or 
                oral evidence may be received, but the agency as a 
                matter of policy shall provide for the exclusion of 
                immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence.

                        require the use of common counsel where the 
                        common counsel may adequately represent the 
                        interests that will be significantly affected 
                        by the proposed rule; and

                held under this subsection.
            ``(4) Petition for public hearing for major rules.--In the 
        case of any major rule, any interested person may petition for 
        a hearing under this subsection on the grounds and within the 
        time limitation set forth in paragraph (1). The agency may deny 
        the petition if the agency reasonably determines that a hearing 
        would not advance the consideration of the proposed rule by the 
        agency or would, in light of the need for agency action, 
        unreasonably delay completion of the rulemaking. The petition 
        and the decision of the agency with respect to the petition 
        shall be included in the rulemaking record.

                during the rulemaking that meets relevant statutory

                costly than the least costly alternative that would

        that are inconsistent or incompatible with, or duplicative of, 
        other regulations of the agency and those of other Federal 
        agencies, and to draft its regulations to be simple and easy to

                        examination.

a statute or regulation shall be reviewable only under subsection 
(a)(2)(D).
    ``(d) Agency Interpretation of Rules.--The weight that a court 
shall give an interpretation by an agency of its own rule shall depend 
on the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its 
reasoning, and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.
    ``(e) Standard of Review.--A court shall review--
            ``(1) the denial of a petition by an agency under section 
        553(e) for whether the denial was based on substantial 
        evidence; and
            ``(2) any petition for review of a high-impact rule under 
        the substantial evidence standard, regardless of whether a 
        hearing was held under section 553(e).''.

Authority To Issue Guidelines for Issuance of Guidance.--
            ``(1) Agency guidance shall--

        Regulatory Affairs shall issue updated guidelines for use by
