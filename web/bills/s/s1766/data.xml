  <summary>11/21/2013--Introduced.
USF Equitable Distribution Act of 2013&#160;- Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require at least 75% of all amounts collected by interstate telecommunications providers from consumers in a rural state for the purpose of making certain contributions to universal service funds established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to be allocated to consumers in that rural state.

Defines "rural state" as a state in which the total population density is not more than 200 people per square mile, as determined by the latest available decennial census.

Prohibits this Act from being construed to require an increase in amounts collected by interstate telecommunications providers from consumers for the purpose of making such contributions.</summary>
