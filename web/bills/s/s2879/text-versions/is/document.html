            (2) examine the status of sustainable chemistry in the 
        education of chemists and chemical engineers and other relevant 
        professions and identify recommendations to improve and broaden 
        the implementation of sustainable chemistry practices in 
        science and engineering education, including examining the role 
        of toxicology, chemical hazard and risk assessment, lifecycle 
        assessment, and environmental fate and effects in science and 
        engineering education;
            (3) examine case studies of successful and unsuccessful 
        attempts at commercialization and adoption of sustainable 
        chemistry processes and products in the United States and 
        abroad and recommend research areas, priorities, and public 
        policy options that would help to overcome identified barriers 
        to commercialization; and
            (4) using available economic analyses, discuss the 
        potential economic impact of sustainable chemistry, including 
        job creation.

for advancing sustainable chemistry research, development, technology 
transfer, commercialization, and education and training.

SEC. 7. PRIORITIZATION.

    In carrying out this Act, the Interagency Working Group shall 
prioritize support for activities that achieve, to the highest extent 
practicable, the goals of sustainable chemistry.
