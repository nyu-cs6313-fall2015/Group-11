&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) at the direction of Congress, the National 
        Academy of Sciences led a comprehensive review of the state of 
        forensic science and issued its findings in a 2009 report, 
        ``Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path 
        Forward'';&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the report's findings indicate the need for 
        independent scientific research to support the foundation of 
        forensic disciplines;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the report stresses the need for standards in 
        methods, data interpretation, and reporting, and the importance 
        of preventing cognitive bias and mitigating human factors; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) according to the report, forensic science 
        research is not financially well supported, and there is a need 
        for a unified strategy for developing a forensic science 
        research plan across Federal agencies.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                proceedings, including all tests, methods, 
                measurements, and procedures.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Applied scientific research.--In 
                subparagraph (A), the term ``applied scientific 
                research'' means a systematic study to gain knowledge 
                or understanding necessary to determine the means by 
                which a recognized and specific need may be
