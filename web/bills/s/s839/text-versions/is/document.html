the coral reef or components thereof and reimbursing the Secretary for 
all assessment costs.
    ``(g) Uniformed Service Officers and Employees.--No officer or 
employee of a uniformed service (as defined in section 101 of title 10, 
United States Code) shall be held liable under this section, either in 
such officer's or employee's personal or official capacity, for any

officer's or employee's official governmental duties.
    ``(h) Contract Employees.--No contract employee of a uniformed 
service (as defined in section 101 of title 10, United States Code), 
serving as vessel master or crew member, shall be liable under this

SEC. 16. ENFORCEMENT.

    The Act (16 U.S.C. 6401 et seq.) is amended by inserting after 
section 213, as added by section 15 of this Act, the following:

``SEC. 214. ENFORCEMENT.

    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall conduct enforcement 
activities to carry out this title.
    ``(b) Powers of Authorized Officers.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any person who is authorized to enforce 
        this title may--
                    ``(A) board, search, inspect, and seize any vessel 
                or other conveyance suspected of being used to violate 
                this title, any regulation promulgated under this 
                title, or any permit issued under this title, and any 
                equipment, stores, and cargo of such vessel, except 
                that such authority shall not exist with respect to 
                vessels owned or time chartered by a uniformed service 
                (as defined in section 101 of title 10, United States 
                Code) as warships or naval auxiliaries;
                    ``(B) seize wherever found any component of coral 
                reef taken or retained in violation of this title, any 
                regulation promulgated under this title, or any permit 
                issued under this title;
                    ``(C) seize any evidence of a violation of this 
                title, any regulation promulgated under this title, or 
                any permit issued under this title;
                    ``(D) execute any warrant or other process issued 
                by any court of competent jurisdiction;
                    ``(E) exercise any other lawful authority; and
                    ``(F) arrest any person, if there is reasonable 
                cause to believe that such person has committed an act 
                prohibited by section 212.
            ``(2) Naval auxiliary defined.--In this subsection, the 
        term `naval auxiliary' means a vessel, other than a warship, 
        that is owned by or under the exclusive control of a uniformed 
        service and used at the time of the destruction, taking, loss 
        or injury for government, non-commercial service, including 
        combat logistics force vessels, pre-positioned vessels, special 
        mission vessels, or vessels exclusively used to transport 
        military supplies and materials.
    ``(c) Civil Enforcement and Permit Sanctions.--
            ``(1) Civil administrative penalty.--Any person subject to 
        the jurisdiction of the United States who violates this title 
        or any regulation promulgated or permit issued hereunder, shall 
        be liable to the United States for a civil administrative 
        penalty of not more than $200,000 for each such violation, to 
        be assessed by the Secretary. Each day of a continuing 
        violation shall constitute a separate violation. In determining 
        the amount of civil administrative penalty, the Secretary shall 
        take into account the nature, circumstances, extent, and 
        gravity of the prohibited acts committed and, with respect to 
        the violator, the degree of culpability, and any history of 
        prior violations, and such other matters as justice may 
        require. In assessing such penalty, the Secretary may also 
        consider information related to the ability of the violator to 
        pay.
            ``(2) Permit sanctions.--For any person subject to the 
        jurisdiction of the United States who has been issued or has 
        applied for a permit under this title, and who violates this 
        title or any regulation or permit issued under this title, the 
        Secretary may deny, suspend, amend, or revoke in whole or in 
        part any such permit. For any person who has failed to pay or 
        defaulted on a payment agreement of any civil penalty or 
        criminal fine or liability assessed pursuant to any natural 
        resource law administered by the Secretary, the Secretary may 
        deny, suspend, amend or revoke in whole or in part any permit 
        issued or applied for under this title.
            ``(3) Imposition of civil judicial penalties.--Any person 
        who violates any provision of this title, any regulation 
        promulgated or permit issued thereunder, shall be subject to a 
        civil judicial penalty not to exceed $250,000 for each such 
        violation. Each day of a continuing violation shall constitute 
        a separate violation. The Attorney General, upon the request of 
        the Secretary, may commence a civil action in an appropriate 
        district court of the United States, and such court shall have 
        jurisdiction to award civil penalties and such other relief as 
        justice may require. In determining the amount of a civil 
        penalty, the court shall take into account the nature, 
        circumstances, extent, and gravity of the prohibited acts 
        committed and, with respect to the violator, the degree of 
        culpability, any history of prior violations, and such other 
        matters as justice may require. In imposing such penalty, the 
        district court may also consider information related to the 
        ability of the violator to pay.
            ``(4) Notice.--No penalty or permit sanction shall be 
        assessed under this subsection until after the person charged 
        has been given notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
            ``(5) In rem jurisdiction.--A vessel used in violating this 
        title, any regulation promulgated under this title, or any 
        permit issued under this title, shall be liable in rem for any 
        civil penalty assessed for such violation. Such penalty shall 
        constitute a maritime lien on the vessel and may be recovered 
        in an action in rem in the district court of the United States 
        having jurisdiction over the vessel.
            ``(6) Collection of penalties.--If any person fails to pay 
        an assessment of a civil penalty under this section after it 
        has become a final and unappealable order, or after the 
        appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the 
        Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney 
        General, who shall recover the amount assessed in any 
        appropriate district court of the United States (plus interest 
        at current prevailing rates from the date of the final order). 
        In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final 
        order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to 
        review. Any person who fails to pay, on a timely basis, the 
        amount of an assessment of a civil penalty shall be required to 
        pay, in addition to such amount and interest, attorney's fees 
        and costs for collection proceedings and a quarterly nonpayment 
        penalty for each quarter during which such failure to pay 
        persists. Such nonpayment penalty shall be in an amount equal 
        to 20 percent of the aggregate amount of such person's 
        penalties and nonpayment penalties that are unpaid as of the 
        beginning of such quarter.
            ``(7) Compromise or other action by secretary.--The 
        Secretary may compromise, modify, or remit, with or without 
        conditions, any civil administrative penalty or permit sanction 
        which is or may be imposed under this section and that has not 
        been referred to the Attorney General for further enforcement 
        action.
            ``(8) Jurisdiction.--The several district courts of the 
        United States shall have jurisdiction over any actions brought 
        by the United States arising under this section. For the 
        purpose of this section, American Samoa shall be included 
        within the judicial district of the District Court of the 
        United States for the District of Hawaii. Each violation shall 
        be a separate offense and the offense shall be deemed to have 
        been committed not only in the district where the violation 
        first occurred, but also in any other district as authorized by 
        law.
    ``(d) Forfeiture.--
            ``(1) Criminal forfeiture.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A person who is convicted of an 
                offense in violation of this title shall forfeit to the

        necessary to abate such risk or actual destruction, loss,
