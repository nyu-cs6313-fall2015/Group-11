SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) production of energy from domestic sources offers

            (2) the agricultural and forestry sectors of the United 
        States offer significant potential for production of renewable 
        energy;
            (3) both renewable energy production and adoption of energy 
        efficiency offer considerable environmental benefits; and
            (4) investments in energy efficiency projects and renewable 
        energy systems in rural areas of the United States provide very 
        significant energy security, economic, and environmental 
        benefits to the entire United States in addition to the rural 
        area benefits.
