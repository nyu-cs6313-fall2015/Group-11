                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to address 
    and take action to prevent bullying and harassment of students.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Schools Improvement Act of 
2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Bullying and harassment foster a climate of fear and 
        disrespect that can seriously impair the physical and 
        psychological health of its victims and create conditions that 
        negatively affect learning, thereby undermining the ability of 
        students to achieve their full potential.
            (2) Bullying and harassment contribute to high dropout 
        rates, increased absenteeism, and academic underachievement.
            (3) Bullying and harassment include a range of behaviors 
        that negatively impact a student's ability to learn and 
        participate in educational opportunities and activities that 
        schools offer. Such behaviors can include hitting or punching, 
        name-calling, intimidation through gestures or social 
        exclusion, and sending insulting or offensive messages through 
        electronic communications, such as internet sites, e-mail, 
        instant messaging, mobile phones and messaging, telephone, or 
        any other means.
            (4) Schools with enumerated anti-bullying and harassment 
        policies have an increased level of reporting and teacher 
        intervention in incidents of bullying and harassment, thereby 
        reducing the overall frequency and number of such incidents.
            (5) Students have been particularly singled out for 
        bullying and harassment on the basis of their actual or 
        perceived race, color, national origin, sex, disability status, 
        sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion, among other 
        categories.
            (6) Some young people experience a form of bullying called 
        relational aggression or psychological bullying, which harms 
        individuals by damaging, threatening, or manipulating their 
        relationships with their peers, or by injuring their feelings 
        of social acceptance.
            (7) Interventions to address bullying and harassment 
        conduct to create a positive and safe school climate, combined 
        with evidence-based discipline policies and practices, such as 
        Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and 
        restorative practices, can minimize suspensions, expulsions, 
        and other exclusionary discipline policies to ensure that 
        students are not ``pushed-out'' or diverted to the juvenile 
        justice system.
            (8) According to one poll, 85 percent of Americans strongly 
        support or somewhat support a Federal law to require schools to 
        enforce specific rules to prevent bullying.
            (9) Students, parents, educators, and policymakers have 
        come together to call for leadership and action to address the 
        national crisis of bullying and harassment.
