                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             June 12, 2013

Mr. Nelson (for himself and Mr. Schumer) introduced the following bill; 
  which was read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To reauthorize the ban on undetectable firearms, and to extend the ban 
     to undetectable firearm receivers and undetectable ammunition 
                               magazines.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Undetectable Firearms Modernization 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) according to data from the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation, 8,583 of the 12,664 murders in the United States 
        in 2011 were committed using a firearm, and more than 57 
        percent of the murders that occurred in New York State were 
        perpetrated with a firearm;
            (2) the ability to produce a receiver for a firearm in the 
        home would circumvent a number of laws, because the receiver is 
        the component of the firearm that bears its serial number, as 
        required by regulations;
            (3) digital manufacturing technologies, including but not 
        limited to computer numerical control mills (``CNC mills''), 3-
        dimensional printers (``3D printers''), and laser cutting 
        machines, are quickly advancing to a point where it will soon 
        be possible to fabricate fully operational firearm components; 
        and
            (4) some commercially available products that utilize 
        digital manufacturing technologies to manufacture objects are 
        able to manufacture these objects using materials that are 
        unable to be detected by traditional metal detectors, and may 
        not present an accurate image on an x-ray.

SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF BAN ON UNDETECTABLE FIREARMS.

    Section 2(f)(2) of the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 (18 U.S.C. 
922 note) is amended by striking ``25'' and inserting ``35''.

SEC. 4. BAN EXTENDED TO UNDETECTABLE FIREARM RECEIVERS MADE BY 
              INDIVIDUALS.

    Section 922(p) of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by 
                striking ``It shall be unlawful'' and all that follows 
                and inserting ``It shall be unlawful--''; and
                    (B) by striking subparagraphs (A) and (B) and 
                inserting the following:
            ``(A) for any person to manufacture, import, sell, ship, 
        deliver, possess, transfer, or receive any firearm--
                    ``(i) that, after removal of grips, stocks, and 
                magazines, is not as detectable as the Security 
                Exemplar, by walk-through metal detectors calibrated 
                and operated to detect the Security Exemplar; or
                    ``(ii) any major component of which, when subjected 
                to inspection by the types of x-ray machines commonly 
                used at airports, does not generate an image that 
                accurately depicts the shape of the component, except 
                that barium sulfate or other compounds may be used in 
                the fabrication of the component; and
            ``(B) for any person--
                    ``(i) to import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, 
                transfer, or receive any receiver for a rifle, or 
                receiver for a handgun, manufactured by a person who is 
                not a licensed manufacturer--
                            ``(I) that is not as detectable as the 
                        Receiver Security Exemplar for a rifle or for a 
                        handgun, as the case may be, by walk-through 
                        metal detectors calibrated and operated to 
                        detect that Receiver Security Exemplar; or
                            ``(II) which, when subjected to inspection 
                        by the types of x-ray machines commonly used at 
                        airports, does not generate an image that 
                        accurately depicts the shape of the receiver, 
                        except that barium sulfate or other compounds 
                        may be used in the fabrication of the receiver; 
                        or
                    ``(ii) who is not a licensed manufacturer to

                (i).'';

                (B);

                subparagraph (C) and inserting ``; and''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(D) the term `Receiver Security Exemplar' means, with 
        respect to a rifle or a handgun, an object, to be fabricated at

        advances in state-of-the-art developments in weapons detection 
        technology.'';
