Prohibits assistance\u00a0to the Governments of Libya and Pakistan and to\u00a0any country where a U.S.\u00a0diplomatic facility\u00a0has been attacked until the President certifies to Congress that such country has cooperated with investigations into such attack and have taken steps to prevent any future attack.\n\nAuthorizes the sale of 8% of federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and 8% of National Forest System land.\u00a0 Requires proceeds from the sale of such land to be used to reduce the annual federal budget deficit or the outstanding national debt. Terminates the authority for the sale of such lands when sales proceeds equal $3.5 million or at the end of FY2024, whichever occurs first."
