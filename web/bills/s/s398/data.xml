Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Women's History Museum Act - Establishes the Commission to Study the Potential Creation of a National Women's History Museum.

Requires the Commission to: (1) report recommendations for a plan of action for the establishment and maintenance of a National Women's History Museum in Washington, D.C.; (2) develop a fundraising plan to support the establishment, operation, and maintenance of the Museum through public contributions; (3) obtain an independent review of such fundraising plan, including an analysis of the resources necessary to fund the construction of the Museum and its operations and maintenance in perpetuity without reliance on federal funds; and (4) submit a legislative plan of action to establish and construct the Museum.

Directs the Commission's recommendations to address issues including the impact of the Museum on regional women history-related museums, whether it should be part of the Smithsonian Institution, and the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining the Museum and acquiring its collections.

Prohibits federal funds from being obligated to carry out this Act.</summary>
