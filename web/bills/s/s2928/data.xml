  <summary>11/13/2014--Introduced.
Requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to publish a cost-benefit analysis before issuing any decision that would either: (1) authorize creation of a new capacity zone, or (2) affect the supply and demand curves or models used to determine prices at points in a capacity zone.

Prohibits FERC from issuing any such decision if it determines that such analysis shows that costs will be raised for ratepayers.

 Backdates the effective date of this Act to January 1, 2014.</summary>
