  <summary>8/1/2013--Introduced.
Clean Ports Act of 2013 - Declares that federal preemption of state and local law relating to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier of property shall not apply to the authority of a state, local government, or the political authority of two or more states to adopt requirements for motor carriers providing services at port facilities that are reasonably related to the reduction of environmental pollution, traffic congestion, the improvement of highway safety, or the efficient use of such port facilities, provided adoption or enforcement of such requirements does not conflict with federal law.

Declares that nothing in this Act shall limit the rights reserved to any state or political subdivision of such state under the Clean Air Act.</summary>
