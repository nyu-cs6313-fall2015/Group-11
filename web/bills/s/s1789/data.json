    "text": "Amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require certain cable system operators, with channel capacity for public, educational, or governmental (PEG) use that is designated by a franchising authority under existing code provisions or required to be provided under this Act, to: (1) carry PEG-use signals to subscribers without material degradation and without altering or removing content or data; (2) provide viewable signals to every cable subscriber without additional service or equipment charges; and (3) provide to the appropriate local government subdivision (LGS), free of charge, any transmission services and the use of any transmission facilities necessary to meet such requirements.\n\nRequires a cable operator in a state adopting applicable franchising legislation that becomes effective after May 31, 2005, to: (1) owe any LGS in which the operator provides cable service during a year beginning after enactment of this Act an LGS-determined amount for such year, within specified limits, notwithstanding requirements relating to support for cable system PEG use in such state legislation; and (2) provide a certain number of channels for PEG use in an LGS, notwithstanding requirements relating to the number of PEG-use cable channels in such state legislation.\n\nDefines \"local government subdivision\" (referred to above as an LGS) as a franchising authority deriving its power to grant a franchise from state or local law or an entity considered such a franchising authority as of the day before the effective date of such state legislation relating to support.\n\nSpecifies forms of support as cash payments, in-kind support, and free services provided by the cable system operator, or its predecessor, to the LGS for the cable system's PEG use.\n\nSets forth provisions regarding: (1) LGS or state enforcement, and (2) nonbinding mediation and court proceedings concerning disputed support amounts.\n\nRevises the definition of \"franchise fee\" including by striking a provision prohibiting such a fee from including (in the case of a franchise granted after the enactment of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984) capital costs that the franchise requires the cable operator to incur for PEG access facilities."
