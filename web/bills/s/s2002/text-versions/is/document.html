To require the Secretary of Energy to conduct a motor and motor-driven 
 systems market assessment and public awareness program, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Motor Systems Market Awareness Act 
of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) motors and motor-driven systems account for a 
        significant quantity of the electricity used in the United 
        States;
            (2) motor electrical energy use is determined by the 
        efficiency of the motor and the design of the motor-driven 
        system in which the motor and the drive operate;
            (3) Federal Government research on commercial and 
        industrial motors and motor-driven system use and efficiency is 
        outdated;
            (4) the Bureau of the Census has discontinued collection of 
        data on motor and generator importation, manufacture, shipment, 
        and sales;
            (5) the last Department of Energy motor market assessment 
        was conducted in 2002;
            (6) motor and motor-driven systems have changed 
        dramatically during the 12-year period ending on the date of 
        enactment of this Act; and
            (7) a new motor and motor-driven system market assessment 
        will help United States manufacturers better understand the 
        commercial marketplace and become more globally competitive.

SEC. 4. MOTOR MARKET ASSESSMENT.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary, in consultation with interested 
parties, shall conduct a market assessment of motors and motor-driven 
systems used in the United States.
    (b) Assessment.--In conducting the assessment under subsection (a), 
the Secretary shall--
            (1) develop a detailed profile of the stock of motors and 
        motor-driven systems in commercial and industrial facilities of 
        the United States (as of the date of enactment of this Act);
            (2) develop a profile of commercial and industrial motor 
        and motor-driven system purchase and maintenance practices;
            (3) analyze the opportunities (by market segment) for 
        improved energy efficiency and cost savings available through--
                    (A) the use of energy efficient motors, variable 
                speed drives, servo drives, and other control 
                technologies;
