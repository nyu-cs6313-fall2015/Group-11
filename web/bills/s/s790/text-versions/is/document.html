        congressional committees under subsection (d)(1); and
            (3) providing the public with an opportunity to submit 
        comments with respect to any of those duty suspensions or

    (d) Submission of Draft Bill.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a draft bill that contains 
        each duty suspension or reduction that the Commission 
        determines, pursuant to the process established under

        a duty suspension or reduction the Commission determines

        bill to be submitted under paragraph (1), the Commission may--
                    (A) modify the article description for the duty 
                suspension or reduction--
                            (i) to ensure that U.S. Customs and Border 
                        Protection can administer the duty suspension 
                        or reduction; or
                            (ii) to correct a technical deficiency in 
                        the article description;
                    (B) modify the duty rate for the duty suspension or 
                reduction so that the estimated loss in revenue to the 
                United States from the duty suspension or reduction 
                does not exceed the amount specified in subsection 
                (f)(1)(B); or
                    (C) consolidate the duty suspension or reduction 
                with other duplicative or overlapping duty suspensions 
                or reductions.
            (4) Special rules for first submission.--For purposes of 
        submitting the draft bill required to be submitted on the date 
        specified in paragraph (1)(A), the Commission--
                    (A) may use the evaluations conducted by the 
                Commission of bills providing for duty suspensions or 
                reductions introduced in the Senate or the House of 
                Representatives during the 112th Congress;
                    (B) shall be required to include only duty 
                suspensions and reductions with respect to which the 
                Commission has sufficient time to make a determination 
                under paragraph (1) before the draft bill is required 
                to be submitted; and
                    (C) shall notify the public of the duty suspensions 
                and reductions the Commission is considering including 
                in the draft bill not later than 30 days before 
                submitting the draft bill.
    (e) Consultations.--In determining whether a duty suspension or 
reduction meets the requirements described in subsection (f), the 
Commission shall, not later than 30 days before submitting a draft bill 
to the appropriate congressional committees under subsection (d), 
conduct consultations with the Commissioner responsible for U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection, the Secretary of Commerce, the United 
States Trade Representative, and the heads of other relevant Federal 
agencies.
    (f) Requirements for Duty Suspensions and Reductions.--
            (1) In general.--A duty suspension or reduction meets the 
        requirements described in this subsection if--
                    (A) the duty suspension or reduction can be 
                administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection;
                    (B) the estimated loss in revenue to the United 
                States from the duty suspension or reduction does not 
                exceed $500,000 in a calendar year during which the 
                duty suspension or reduction would be in effect; and
                    (C) on the date on which the Commission submits a 
                draft bill to the appropriate congressional committees 
                under subsection (d) that includes the duty suspension 
                or reduction, the article to which the duty suspension 
                or reduction would apply is not produced in the United 
                States and is not expected to be produced in the United 
                States during the subsequent 12-month period.
            (2) Consideration of relevant information.--In determining 
        whether a duty suspension or reduction meets the requirements 
        described in paragraph (1), the Commission may consider any 
        information the Commission considers relevant to the 
        determination.
            (3) Judicial review precluded.--A determination of the 
        Commission with respect to whether or not a duty suspension or 
        reduction meets the requirements described in paragraph (1) 
        shall not be subject to judicial review.
    (g) Reports Required.--
            (1) In general.--Each time the Commission submits a draft 
        bill under subsection (d), the Commission shall submit to the

        suspensions and reductions contained in the draft bill that 
        includes--
                    (A) the views of the head of each agency consulted

                        suspensions or reductions the Commission 
                        included in the draft bill; and
                            (ii) objections that led to the Commission 
                        to determine not to include a duty suspension

                requirements of this section;
                    (B) to the extent practicable, a description of the 
                effects of duty suspensions and reductions recommended

                estimated during that process, based on data available 
                at the time of the submission of the report;
                    (D) to the extent practicable, information on how 
                broadly or narrowly duty suspensions and reductions
