                                 A BILL


 
 To expand the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 
 2006 to increase accountability and transparency in Federal spending, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Accountability and 
Transparency Act of 2013''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. PURPOSES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The purposes of this Act are to--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) expand the Federal Funding Accountability and 
        Transparency Act of 2006 by disclosing direct Federal agency 
        expenditures and linking Federal contract, loan, and grant 
        spending information to programs of Federal agencies in order 
        to enable taxpayers and policy makers to track Federal spending 
        more effectively;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) provide consistent, reliable, and searchable 
        Government-wide spending data that is displayed accurately for 
        taxpayers and policy makers on USASpending.gov;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) analyze Federal spending data to proactively 
        prevent waste, fraud, abuse, and improper payments;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) simplify reporting for entities receiving 
        Federal funds by streamlining reporting requirements and 
        reducing compliance costs while improving transparency; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) improve the quality of data submitted to 
        USASpending.gov by holding Federal agencies accountable for the 
        completeness and accuracy of the data submitted.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
              TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2006.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

enactment of this Act, the Recovery Accountability and Transparency 
Board, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the 
Director of the Office of Management, shall establish a pilot program 
relating to reporting by recipients of Federal funds (in this section

financial transparency to--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        required of recipients of Federal funds by consolidating and 
        automating financial reporting requirements across the Federal 
        Government.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Requirements.--The pilot program shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) include recipients that collectively receive 
        not less than $1,000,000,000 in Federal funds each fiscal 
        year;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) include recipients that receive Federal funds 
        under multiple programs across multiple agencies; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) include recipients that collectively receive 
        Federal funds under contracts, grants, and subawards.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Reporting and Evaluation Requirements.--Each recipient 
of Federal funds participating in the pilot program shall submit to the 
Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board reports on the finances 
of the selected Federal awards.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Publication of Information.--All the information 
collected by the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board under 
the pilot program shall be made publicly available and searchable on 
the website established under section 2 of the Federal Funding 
Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (31 U.S.C. 6101 
note).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Termination.--The pilot program shall terminate on the 
date that is 3 years after the date on which the Recovery 
Accountability and Transparency Board establishes the pilot 
program.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (f) Report to Congress.--Not later than 90 days after the 
date on which the pilot program terminates under subsection (e), the 
Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board shall submit to the

Committee on the Budget of the Senate and the Committee on Oversight 
and Government Reform and the Committee on the Budget of the House of 
Representatives a report on the pilot program, which shall include--
