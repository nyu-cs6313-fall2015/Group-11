            (1) In general.--Pursuant to its authority under section 
        994(p) of title 28, United States Code, the United States 
        Sentencing Commission shall review and, if appropriate, amend 
        the Federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements

            (2) Requirements.--In carrying out this section, the 
        Commission shall--
                    (A) review the penalty structure that the 
                guidelines currently provide based on the number of 
                firearms involved in the offense and determine whether 
                any changes to that penalty structure are appropriate 
                in order to reflect the intent of Congress that such 
                penalties reflect the gravity of the offense; and
                    (B) review and amend, if appropriate, the 
                guidelines and policy statements to reflect the intent 
                of Congress that guideline penalties for violations of 
                section 932 of title 18, United States Code, and 
                similar offenses be increased substantially when 
                committed by a person who is a member of a gang, 
                cartel, organized crime ring, or other such enterprise 
                or in concert with another person who is a member of a 
                gang, cartel, organized crime ring or other such 
                enterprise.
