2014''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to expedite wildfire prevention projects to reduce the 
        chances of wildfire on certain high-risk Federal land adjacent 
        to communities, private property, and critical infrastructure;
            (2) to improve forest and wildland health; and
            (3) to promote the recovery of threatened and endangered 
        species, or other species under consideration for listing under 
        the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), 
        including sage-grouse, whose habitat is negatively impacted by 
        wildland fire.

        subsections (f) through (i), respectively;
            (2) in subsection (c)(1)(C)(i), by striking ``subsection 
        (f)'' and inserting ``subsection (g)''; and

                pose a risk to the adjacent non-Federal land.
