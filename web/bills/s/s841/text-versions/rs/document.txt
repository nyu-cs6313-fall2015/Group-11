        connected;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) the Watershed--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) is the only area in the State that is 
                not a unit of National Wilderness Preservation System 
                to achieve a designation of outstanding waters by the 
                State;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) provides a crucial source of clean 
                drinking water for the residents of the Animas River 
                Valley and the city of Durango, Colorado; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) provides high quality agricultural 
                water supplies from Hermosa Creek and the Animas 
                River;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) the Watershed helps ensure the economic 
        prosperity of local communities in the area that depend on the 
        Watershed for water supplies, recreation, hunting, fishing, 
        hiking, biking, camping, skiing and related winter activities, 
        off-road vehicle travel, scientific research, mineral 
        extraction, and sustainable natural resource 
        development;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) the world-class Hermosa Creek trail network 
        contains outstanding single track mountain bike riding,

        riding;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) the Watershed provides visitors the 
        opportunity to enjoy the tremendous scenic, natural, cultural, 
        and recreational resources of the area;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) ecologically sustainable grazing has been 
        conducted in a manner that has preserved the high quality of 
        the Watershed;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) the native Colorado River cutthroat trout 
        fishery located in the Watershed--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) is one of the most important fisheries 
                in the State;</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (B) is crucial for the long-term survival 
                of the cutthroat trout; and</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (C) provides an opportunity for anglers to 
                have a catch and release fishery for the cutthroat 
                trout;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) the work of Colorado Parks and Wildlife to 
        enhance the fishery referred to in paragraph (7) has been a 
        tremendous success and a great example of cooperative 
        conservation efforts to recover an imperiled species of 
        fish;</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (9) the Watershed--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) provides some of the best backcountry 
                elk habitat in the State; and</DELETED>

        ponderosa pine in the State) provide excellent wildlife habitat 
        and excellent opportunities for solitude and backcountry 
        recreation; and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (11) designation of the Hermosa Creek Wilderness 
        Area, Watershed Protection Area, and Special Management Area 
        would protect those areas in perpetuity for the benefit of the
