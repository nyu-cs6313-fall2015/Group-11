                TITLE II--WATER RESOURCES POLICY REFORMS

SEC. 2001. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to reform the implementation of water resources 
        projects by the Corps of Engineers;
            (2) to make other technical changes to the water resources 
        policy of the Corps of Engineers; and
            (3) to implement reforms, including--
                    (A) enhancing the ability of local sponsors to 
                partner with the Corps of Engineers by ensuring the 
                eligibility of the local sponsors to receive and apply 
                credit for work carried out by the sponsors and 
                increasing the role of sponsors in carrying out Corps 
                of Engineers projects;
                    (B) ensuring continuing authority programs can 
                continue to meet important needs;
                    (C) encouraging the continuation of efforts to 
                modernize feasibility studies and establish targets for 
                expedited completion of feasibility studies;
                    (D) seeking efficiencies in the management of dams 
                and related infrastructure to reduce environmental 
                impacts while maximizing other benefits and project 
                purposes, such as flood control, navigation, water 
                supply, and hydropower;
                    (E) clarifying mitigation requirements for Corps of 
                Engineers projects and ensuring transparency in the 
                independent external review of those projects; and
                    (F) establishing an efficient and transparent 
                process for deauthorizing projects that have failed to 
                receive a minimum level of investment to ensure active 
                projects can move forward while reducing the backlog of 
                authorized projects.

SEC. 2009. HYDROPOWER AT CORPS OF ENGINEERS FACILITIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) in April 2012, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory of the 
        Department of Energy (referred to in this section as the ``Oak 
        Ridge Lab'') released a report finding that adding 
        hydroelectric power to the non-powered dams of the United 
        States has the potential to add more than 12 gigawatts of new 
        generating capacity;
            (2) the top 10 non-powered dams identified by the Oak Ridge 
        Lab as having the highest hydroelectric power potential could 
        alone supply 3 gigawatts of generating capacity;
            (3) of the 50 non-powered dams identified by the Oak Ridge 
        Lab as having the highest hydroelectric power potential, 48 are 
        Corps of Engineers civil works projects;
            (4) promoting non-Federal hydroelectric power at Corps of 
        Engineers civil works projects increases the taxpayer benefit 
        of those projects;
            (5) the development of non-Federal hydroelectric power at 
        Corps of Engineers civil works projects--
                    (A) can be accomplished in a manner that is 
                consistent with authorized project purposes and the 
                responsibilities of the Corps of Engineers to protect 
                the environment; and
                    (B) in many instances, may have additional 
                environmental benefits; and
            (6) the development of non-Federal hydroelectric power at 
        Corps of Engineers civil works projects could be promoted 
        through--
                    (A) clear and consistent lines of responsibility 
                and authority within and across Corps of Engineers 
                districts and divisions on hydroelectric power 
                development activities;
                    (B) consistent and corresponding processes for 
                reviewing and approving hydroelectric power 
                development; and
                    (C) developing a means by which non-Federal 
                hydroelectric power developers and stakeholders can 
                resolve disputes with the Corps of Engineers concerning 
                hydroelectric power development activities at Corps of 
                Engineers civil works projects.
    (b) Policy.--Congress declares that it is the policy of the United 
States that--
            (1) the development of non-Federal hydroelectric power at 
        Corps of Engineers civil works projects, including locks and 
        dams, shall be given priority;
            (2) Corps of Engineers approval of non-Federal 
        hydroelectric power at Corps of Engineers civil works projects, 
        including permitting required under section 14 of the Act of 
        March 3, 1899 (33 U.S.C. 408), shall be completed by the Corps 
        of Engineers in a timely and consistent manner; and
            (3) approval of hydropower at Corps of Engineers civil 
        works projects shall in no way diminish the other priorities 
        and missions of the Corps of Engineers, including authorized 
        project purposes and habitat and environmental protection.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act and each year thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to the

        non-Federal entities approved at Corps of Engineers civil works 
        projects in that fiscal year, including the length of time the 
        Secretary needed to approve those activities;
            (3) a description of the status of each pending application 
        from non-Federal entities for approval to develop hydroelectric 
        power at Corps of Engineers civil works projects;
            (4) a description of any benefits or impacts to the 
        environment, recreation, or other uses associated with Corps of 
        Engineers civil works projects at which non-Federal entities 
        have developed hydroelectric power in the previous fiscal year; 
        and
            (5) the total annual amount of payments or other services 
        provided to the Corps of Engineers, the Treasury, and any other 
        Federal agency as a result of approved non-Federal hydropower 
        projects at Corps of Engineers civil works projects.

SEC. 2015. WATER SUPPLY.

    Section 301 of the Water Supply Act of 1958 (43 U.S.C. 390b) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e) The Committees of jurisdiction are very concerned about the 
operation of projects in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River 
System and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River System, and further, the 
Committees of jurisdiction recognize that this ongoing water resources 
dispute raises serious concerns related to the authority of the 
Secretary of the Army to allocate substantial storage at projects to 
provide local water supply pursuant to the Water Supply Act of 1958 
absent congressional approval. Interstate water disputes of this nature 
are more properly addressed through interstate water agreements that 
take into consideration the concerns of all affected States including 
impacts to other authorized uses of the projects, water supply for 
communities and major cities in the region, water quality, freshwater 
flows to communities, rivers, lakes, estuaries, and bays located 
downstream of projects, agricultural uses, economic development, and 
other appropriate concerns. To that end, the Committees of jurisdiction 
strongly urge the Governors of the affected States to reach agreement 
on an interstate water compact as soon as possible, and we pledge our 
commitment to work with the affected States to ensure prompt 
consideration and approval of any such agreement. Absent such action, 
the Committees of jurisdiction should consider appropriate legislation 
to address these matters including any necessary clarifications to the 
Water Supply Act of 1958 or other law. This subsection does not alter 
existing rights or obligations under law.''.

SEC. 2016. REPORT ON WATER STORAGE PRICING FORMULAS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) due to the ongoing drought in many parts of the United 
        States, communities are looking for ways to enhance their water 
        storage on Corps of Engineer reservoirs so as to maintain a 
        reliable supply of water into the foreseeable future;
            (2) water storage pricing formulas should be equitable and 
        not create disparities between users; and
            (3) water pricing formulas should not be cost-prohibitive 
        for communities.
    (b) Assessment.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United 
        States shall initiate an assessment of the water storage 
        pricing formulas of the Corps of Engineers, which shall include 
        an assessment of--
                    (A) existing water storage pricing formulas of the 
                Corps of Engineers, in particular whether those 
                formulas produce water storage costs for some 
                beneficiaries that are greatly disparate from the costs 
                of other beneficiaries; and
                    (B) whether equitable water storage pricing 
                formulas could lessen the disparate impact and produce 
                more affordable water storage for potential 
                beneficiaries.
            (2) Report.--The Comptroller General of the United States 
        shall submit to Congress a report on the assessment carried out 
        under paragraph (1).

                         TITLE VI--LEVEE SAFETY

SEC. 6001. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``National Levee Safety Program 
Act''.

SEC. 6002. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) there is a need to establish a national levee safety 
        program to provide national leadership and encourage the 
        establishment of State and tribal levee safety programs;
            (2) according to the National Committee on Levee Safety, 
        ``the level of protection and robustness of design and 
        construction of levees vary considerably across the country'';
            (3) knowing the location, condition, and ownership of 
        levees, as well as understanding the population and 
        infrastructure at risk in leveed areas, is necessary for 
        identification and prioritization of activities associated with 
        levees;
            (4) levees are an important tool for reducing flood risk 
        and should be considered in the context of broader flood risk 
        management efforts;
            (5) States and Indian tribes--
                    (A) are uniquely positioned to oversee, coordinate, 
                and regulate local and regional levee systems; and
                    (B) should be encouraged to participate in a 
                national levee safety program by establishing 
                individual levee safety programs; and
            (6) States, Indian tribes, and local governments that do 
        not invest in protecting the individuals and property located 
        behind levees place those individuals and property at risk.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
            (1) to promote sound technical practices in levee design, 
        construction, operation, inspection, assessment, security, and 
        maintenance;
            (2) to ensure effective public education and awareness of 
        risks involving levees;
            (3) to establish and maintain a national levee safety 
        program that emphasizes the protection of human life and 
        property; and
            (4) to implement solutions and incentives that encourage 
        the establishment of effective State and tribal levee safety 
        programs.

1992 (33 U.S.C. 2327(1)(E)(ii)) is amended by striking ``$8,000,000'' 
and inserting ``$20,000,000''.

SEC. 7005. INLAND WATERWAYS SYSTEM REVENUES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) there are approximately 12,000 miles of Federal 
        waterways, known as the inland waterways system, that are 
        supported by user fees and managed by the Corps of Engineers;
            (2) the inland waterways system spans 38 States and handles 
        approximately one-half of all inland waterway freight;
            (3) according to the final report of the Inland Marine 
        Transportation System Capital Projects Business Model, freight 
        traffic on the Federal fuel-taxed inland waterways system 
        accounts for 546,000,000 tons of freight each year;
            (4) expenditures for construction and major rehabilitation 
        projects on the inland waterways system are equally cost-shared 
        between the Federal Government and the Inland Waterways Trust 
        Fund;
            (5) the Inland Waterways Trust Fund is financed through a 
        fee of $0.20 per gallon on fuel used by commercial barges;
            (6) the balance of the Inland Waterways Trust Fund has 
        declined significantly in recent years;
            (7) according to the final report of the Inland Marine 
        Transportation System Capital Projects Business Model, the 
        estimated financial need for construction and major 
        rehabilitation projects on the inland waterways system for 
        fiscal years 2011 through 2030 is approximately 
        $18,000,000,000; and
            (8) users of the inland waterways system are supportive of 
        an increase in the existing revenue sources for inland 
        waterways system construction and major rehabilitation 
        activities to expedite the most critical of those construction 
        and major rehabilitation projects.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the existing revenue sources for inland waterways 
        system construction and rehabilitation activities are 
        insufficient to cover the costs of non-Federal interests of 
        construction and major rehabilitation projects on the inland 
        waterways system; and
            (2) the issue described in paragraph (1) should be 
        addressed.

SEC. 7006. EFFICIENCY OF REVENUE COLLECTION.

    Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Comptroller General shall prepare a report on the efficiency of 
collecting the fuel tax for the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, which 
shall include--
            (1) an evaluation of whether current methods of collection 
        of the fuel tax result in full compliance with requirements of 
        the law;
            (2) whether alternative methods of collection would result 
        in increased revenues into the Inland Waterways Trust Fund; and
            (3) an evaluation of alternative collection options.

SEC. 7007. GAO STUDY, OLMSTED LOCKS AND DAM, LOWER OHIO RIVER, ILLINOIS 
              AND KENTUCKY.

    As soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct, and submit to 
Congress a report describing the results of, a study to determine why, 
and to what extent, the project for navigation, Lower Ohio River, Locks 
and Dams 52 and 53, Illinois and Kentucky (commonly known as the 
``Olmsted Locks and Dam project''), authorized by section 3(a)(6) of 
the Water Resources Development Act of 1988 (102 Stat. 4013), has 
exceeded the budget for the project and the reasons why the project 
failed to be completed as scheduled, including an assessment of--
            (1) engineering methods used for the project;
            (2) the management of the project;
            (3) contracting for the project;
            (4) the cost to the United States of benefits foregone due 
        to project delays; and
            (5) such other contributory factors as the Comptroller 
        General determines to be appropriate.

SEC. 7008. OLMSTED LOCKS AND DAM, LOWER OHIO RIVER, ILLINOIS AND 
              KENTUCKY.

    Section 3(a)(6) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1988 (102 
Stat. 4013) is amended by striking ``and with the costs of 
construction'' and all that follows through the period at the end and 
inserting ``which amounts remaining after the date of enactment of this 
Act shall be appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury.''.

                indicating that the senior obligations of the project 
                (which may be the Federal credit instrument) have the
