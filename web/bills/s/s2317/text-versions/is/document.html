SEC. 2. RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS IN

    (a) In General.--Chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 1660. Restrictions on certain confidentiality agreements in 
              settlements
    ``(a) Definition.--In this section, the term `hazard to public 
safety or health' means an activity, substance, or condition that has a 
potential to cause harm to the health or safety of the public.
    ``(b) Disclosure in General.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), a 
        court may not approve or order the enforcement of any provision 
        in a settlement agreement, or other agreement relating to a 
        settlement, between or among parties in a civil suit if--
                    ``(A) a pleading filed in the suit alleges facts 
                that are relevant to protecting the public from a 
                hazard to public safety or health; and
                    ``(B) the provision prohibits a party from--
                            ``(i) disclosing the fact that the 
                        settlement was reached;
                            ``(ii) disclosing the terms of the 
                        settlement, other than the amount of money, if 
                        any, paid under the settlement;
                            ``(iii) discussing the suit or evidence 
                        produced in the suit; or
                            ``(iv) otherwise discussing the hazard to 
                        public safety or health.
            ``(2) Balance of interests.--
                    ``(A) In general.--On a motion by a party to an 
                agreement described in paragraph (1), a court may 
                approve or order the enforcement of a provision 
                described in paragraph (1)(B), despite the fact that a 
                pleading described in paragraph (1)(A) is filed in the 
                suit, if the court, based on an independent finding of 
                fact, determines that--
                            ``(i) the public interest in the disclosure 
                        of facts that are relevant to protecting the 
                        public from a hazard to public safety or health 
                        is outweighed by a specific and substantial 
                        interest in maintaining the confidentiality of 
                        the information or records that are covered by 
                        the provision; and
                            ``(ii) the requested order is no broader 
                        than necessary to protect the specific and 
                        substantial interest in maintaining 
                        confidentiality described in clause (i).
                    ``(B) Considerations.--With respect to the 
                balancing of interests described in subparagraph 
                (A)(i)--
                            ``(i) there shall be a rebuttable 
                        presumption that the interest in protecting 
                        financial, medical, or other similar personal 
                        information relating to an identifiable 
                        individual outweighs the public interest 
                        described in subparagraph (A)(i);
                            ``(ii) a general interest in the settlement 
                        of disputes may not serve as a specific and 
                        substantial interest described in subparagraph 
                        (A)(i); and
                            ``(iii) a court may redact language in a 
                        settlement agreement, in order to accommodate--
                                    ``(I) the privacy of personal 
                                information; and
                                    ``(II) the public benefit of 
                                awareness of hazards to public safety 
                                and health.
    ``(c) Disclosure to Federal or State Agencies.--
            ``(1) In general.--A court may not approve or order the 
        enforcement of any provision of a settlement agreement, or 
        other agreement relating to a settlement, between or among 
        parties in a civil suit if--
                    ``(A) a pleading filed in the suit alleges facts 
                that are relevant to protecting the public from a 
                hazard to public safety or health; and
                    ``(B) the provision prohibits or otherwise 
                restricts a party from disclosing a fact described in 
                subparagraph (A) to a Federal or State agency with 
                authority to enforce a law or regulate an activity 
                relating to that fact.
            ``(2) Confidentiality maintained.--The confidentiality of a 
        fact described in paragraph (1)(A) that is disclosed to a 
        Federal or State agency described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be 
        protected to the extent otherwise provided under any other law, 
        regulation, or agreement.''.
    (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for 
chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following:

``1660. Restrictions on certain confidentiality agreements in 
                            settlements.''.
