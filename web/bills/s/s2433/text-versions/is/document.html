                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

             referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To provide assistance to Ukraine to reduce the dependence of Ukraine on 
   imports of natural gas from the Russian Federation, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ukrainian Independence from Russian 
Energy Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Ukraine is dependent on natural gas supplies from the 
        Russian Federation to meet more than half of demand in Ukraine.
            (2) Entities owned by the Government of the Russian 
        Federation have manipulated natural gas supplies and prices in 
        Ukraine in order to gain geopolitical leverage over Ukraine and 
        neighboring countries of Ukraine.
            (3) Energy subsidies provided by the Government of Ukraine 
        amount to roughly 8 percent of the gross domestic product of 
        Ukraine and make energy markets opaque, inefficient, and 
        susceptible to corruption.
            (4) Ukraine is the second-least energy efficient country in 
        the world.
            (5) The International Energy Agency has estimated that if 
        the economy of Ukraine were as energy efficient as the average 
        country in Europe, Ukraine would reduce natural gas consumption 
        by greater than 50 percent.
            (6) The level of savings from the reduction described in 
        paragraph (6) could nearly eliminate the dependence of Ukraine 
        on imports of natural gas from the Russian Federation.
            (7) The World Bank Group has estimated that Ukraine could 
        reduce the amount of natural gas used for heating by 50 percent 
        through efficiency measures.
            (8) On April 25, 2014, a coalition of 35 cities in Ukraine 
        sent a letter urgently requesting assistance in increasing the 
        energy efficiency of their buildings, district heating systems, 
        and transportation networks in order to reduce dependence on 
        imports of natural gas from the Russian Federation.
            (9) A $17,000,000,000 loan package from the International 
        Monetary Fund to help stabilize the economy of Ukraine requires 
        reforms of energy markets in Ukraine and includes provisions to 
        gradually eliminate energy subsidies, which will raise retail 
        natural gas rates by 56 percent in 2014, 40 percent in 2015, 
        and 20 percent in 2016 and 2017.
            (10) Absent large reductions in energy consumption, the 
        rate increases mandated by the International Monetary Fund loan 
        package from the International Monetary Fund could have 
        devastating impacts on low-income households in Ukraine.
            (11) Ukraine is estimated to have significant conventional 
        and unconventional oil and gas reserves, which are mostly 
        untapped.
            (12) The International Energy Agency has estimated that 
        Ukraine possesses natural gas reserves of approximately 
        5,400,000,000,000 cubic meters, although the annexation of 
        Crimea by the Russian Federation may impact Ukraine's 
        recoverable oil and gas reserves.
            (13) Exports of liquefied natural gas from the United 
        States to Ukraine would not provide assistance for Ukraine in 
        the short term and would be unlikely to reach Ukraine in the 
        long term because--
                    (A) of natural gas global market dynamics;
                    (B) there are no liquefied natural gas import 
                facilities in Ukraine; and
                    (C) the Government of Turkey has indicated it would 
                block shipments of liquefied natural gas through the 
                Bosphorus Strait because of safety concerns.

SEC. 3. POLICY ON SUPPORTING ENERGY INDEPENDENCE OF UKRAINE.

    It is the policy of the United States to use all resources of the 
United States Government--
            (1) to coordinate with multi-donor efforts to reform energy 
        subsidies provided by the Government of Ukraine and energy 
        markets in Ukraine;
            (2) to encourage private sector investment in the energy 
        sector of Ukraine;
            (3) to protect low-income households in Ukraine from 
        dramatic increases in energy rates;
            (4) to increase transparency and reduce corruption in the 
        energy sector of Ukraine;
            (5) to improve energy efficiency, increase domestic energy 
        supplies, and develop alternative sources of energy in Ukraine 
        in order to reduce the reliance of Ukraine on energy from the 
        Russian Federation; and
            (6) to increase the capacity of agencies of the Government 
        of Ukraine, nongovernmental organizations, and private entities 
        to administer and manage energy efficiency and energy security-
        related projects in Ukraine.
