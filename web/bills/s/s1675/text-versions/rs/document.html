                resources in such communities available to support 
                successful reentry and to lessen the burden placed on 
                such communities by the need to support 
                reentry.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                it shall impose an appropriate sanction, which may 
                include the following, if appropriate:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) Modification of the terms of

                        defendant's supervised release and the 
                        imposition of a sentence of incarceration that 
                        is no longer than necessary to punish the 
                        participant for such violation and deter the 
                        participant from committing future 
                        violations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        required under paragraph (1) shall continue for not less than 5

    ``(b) Development of System.--
            ``(1) In general.--In designing the Assessment System, the 
        Attorney General shall--
                    ``(A) use available research and best practices in 
                the field and consult with academic and other criminal 
                justice experts as appropriate; and

                indicators of progress and improvement, and of 
                regression, including newly acquired skills, attitude, 
                and behavior changes over time, through meaningful 
                consideration of dynamic risk factors, such that--
                            ``(i) all prisoners at each risk level 
                        other than low risk have a meaningful 
                        opportunity to progress to a lower risk 
                        classification during the period of the 
                        incarceration of the prisoner through changes 
                        in dynamic risk factors; and
                            ``(ii) all prisoners on prerelease custody, 
                        other than prisoners classified as low risk, 
                        have a meaningful opportunity to progress to a 
                        lower risk classification during such custody 
                        through changes in dynamic risk factors.
            ``(2) Risk and needs assessment tools.--In carrying out 
        this subsection, the Attorney General shall--
                    ``(A) develop a suitable intake assessment tool to 
                perform the initial assessments and determinations 
                described in subsection (a)(1), and to make the 
                assignments described in subsection (a)(3);

                perform the reassessments and updates described in 
                subsection (a)(4); and
                    ``(C) develop a suitable tool to assess the 
                recidivism risk level of prisoners in prerelease 
                custody.
            ``(3) Use of existing risk and needs assessment tools 
        permitted.--In carrying out this subsection, the Attorney 
        General may use existing risk and needs assessment tools, as 
        appropriate, for the assessment tools required under paragraph 
        (2).
            ``(4) Validation.--In carrying out this subsection, the 
        Attorney General shall statistically validate the risk and 
        needs assessment tools on the Federal prison population, or 
        ensure that the tools have been so validated. To the extent 
        such validation cannot be completed with the time period 
        specified in subsection (a), the Attorney General shall ensure 
        that such validation is completed as soon as is practicable.
            ``(5) Relationship with existing classification systems.--
        The Bureau of Prisons may incorporate its existing Inmate 
        Classification System into the Assessment System if the 
        Assessment System assesses the risk level and criminogenic 
        needs of each prisoner and determines the appropriate security 
        level institution for each prisoner. Before the development of 
        the Assessment System, the Bureau of Prisons may use the 
        existing Inmate Classification System, or a pre-existing risk 
        and needs assessment tool that can be used to classify 
        prisoners consistent with subsection (a)(1), or can be 
        reasonably adapted for such purpose, for purposes of this 
        section, section 3621(h), and section 3624(c).
    ``(c) Risk Assessment.--
            ``(1) Initial assessments.--Not later than 30 months after 
        the date on which the Attorney General develops the Assessment 
        System, the Bureau of Prisons shall determine the risk level of 
        each prisoner using the Assessment System.
            ``(2) Reassessments and updates.--The Bureau of Prisons 
        shall update the assessment of each prisoner required under 
        paragraph (1)--
                    ``(A) not less frequently than once each year for 
                any prisoner whose anticipated release date is within 3 
                years;

                for any prisoner whose anticipated release date is 
                within 10 years; and
                    ``(C) not less frequently than once every 3 years 
                for any other prisoner.
    ``(d) Assignment of Recidivism Reduction Programs or Productive 
Activities.--The Assessment System shall provide guidance on the kind 
and amount of recidivism reduction programming or productive activities 
appropriate for each prisoner.
    ``(e) Bureau of Prisons Training.--The Attorney General shall 
develop training protocols and programs for Bureau of Prisons officials 
and employees responsible for administering the Assessment System. Such 
training protocols shall include a requirement that personnel of the 
Bureau of Prisons demonstrate competence in using the methodology and 
procedure developed under this section on a regular basis.
    ``(f) Quality Assurance.--In order to ensure that the Bureau of 
Prisons is using the Assessment System in an appropriate and consistent 
manner, the Attorney General shall monitor and assess the use of the 
Assessment System and shall conduct periodic audits of the use of the 
Assessment System at facilities of the Bureau of Prisons.
    ``(g) Determinations and Classifications Unreviewable.--Subject to 
any constitutional limitations, there shall be no right of review, 
right of appeal, cognizable property interest, or cause of action, 
either administrative or judicial, arising from any determination or 
classification made by any Federal agency or employee while 
implementing or administering the Assessment System, or any rules or 
regulations promulgated under this section.
    ``(h) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Dynamic risk factor.--The term `dynamic risk factor' 
        means a characteristic or attribute that has been shown to be 
        relevant to assessing risk of recidivism and that can be 
        modified based on a prisoner's actions, behaviors, or 
        attitudes, including through completion of appropriate 
        programming or other means, in a prison setting.
            ``(2) Recidivism risk.--The term `recidivism risk' means 
        the likelihood that a prisoner will commit additional crimes 
        for which the prisoner could be prosecuted in a Federal, State, 
        or local court in the United States.
            ``(3) Recidivism reduction program; productive activity; 
        recovery programming.--The terms `recidivism reduction 
        program', `productive activity', and `recovery programming' 
        shall have the meaning given such terms in section 
        3621(h)(8).''.

        10 percent of the prisoner's imposed sentence in home 
        confinement pursuant to this paragraph.'';

        time spent in prerelease custody pursuant to paragraph (1), a 
        prisoner shall spend an additional portion of the final months 
        of the prisoner's sentence, equivalent to the amount of time 
        credit the prisoner has earned pursuant to section

                declined during the period of the prisoner's 
                incarceration.
            ``(3) Types of prerelease custody.--A prisoner eligible to 
        serve a portion of the prisoner's sentence in prerelease 
        custody pursuant to paragraph (2) may serve such portion in a

                credit awarded under subsection (h)(6)(A) to a prisoner 
                who receives a reduction under subparagraph (B), but 
                such reduction may not exceed one-half the amount of 
                the reduction awarded to the prisoner under 
                subparagraph (B).''.

        supervision and the use of swift, predictable, and graduated 
        sanctions for noncompliance with program rules, in Federal

                    (C) In the event that a probation officer 
                determines that a participant has violated a term of 
                supervised release, the officer shall notify the court 
                within 24 hours of such determination, absent good 
                cause.
                    (D) As soon as is practicable, and in no case more 
                than 1 week after the violation was reported by the 
                probation officer, absent good cause, the court shall 
                conduct a hearing on the alleged violation.
                    (E) If the court determines that a program 
                participant has violated a term of supervised release,

                        supervised release and the imposition of a 
                        sentence of incarceration that is no longer 
                        than necessary to punish the participant for 
                        such violation and deter the participant from 
                        committing future violations.
                            (iv) For participants who habitually fail 
                        to abide by program rules or pose a threat to

                incarceration as described in paragraph (2)(E) to, 
                where practicable, serve the terms of incarceration

                    (B) Requirement.--The advisory sentencing policies 
                established under subparagraph (A) shall be consistent

                than necessary for violations of program rules.
            (5) Duration of program.--The pilot program required under
