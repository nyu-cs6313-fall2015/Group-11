SEC. 483C. ONE-TIME FAFSA PILOT PROGRAM.

    Part G of title IV (20 U.S.C. 1088 et seq.) is further amended by 
inserting after section 483C, as added by section 485, the following:

``SEC. 483E. ONE-TIME FAFSA PILOT PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            ``(1) to streamline the annual process by which students 
        apply for Federal financial assistance; and
            ``(2) to reduce the need for students to apply for such 
        assistance each year.
    ``(b) Pilot Program Authorized.--The Secretary is authorized to 
establish a pilot program and select 5 eligible States--
            ``(1) in which a student who attends an institution of 
        higher education in the eligible State may submit a single Free 
        Application for Federal Student Aid described in section 483 
        and as modified under subsection (d) (referred to in this 
        section as the `FAFSA)', to be used for application to 
        determine the need and eligibility of the student for financial 
        assistance under this title during the official length of the 
        student's proposed postsecondary degree program; and
            ``(2) that shall receive a grant in accordance with 
        subsection (e).
    ``(c) Eligible States.--The Secretary shall select 5 eligible 
States that are determined by the Secretary to have a strong record of 
increasing college access and affordability, especially for low-income 
students, to participate in the pilot program described in subsection 
(b). The selection of eligible States shall be based on the extent to 
which the State has--
            ``(1) invested, and continues to invest, significantly in 
        public higher education, resulting in a comparatively lower net 
        price for low-income students;
            ``(2) allocated State financial aid primarily on the basis 
        of need; and
            ``(3) agreed, as a condition of the State's application for 
        the pilot program under this section, to provide all in-State 
        students (as determined by the State) with an offer for State 
        financial aid that--
                    ``(A) is valid for not less than 2 years and not 
                more than 4 years, as determined by the State; and
                    ``(B) shall be subject to change only upon certain 
                conditions, such as significant changes in a student's 
                financial circumstances.
    ``(d) Single FAFSA Submission.--The Secretary shall implement, in 
consultation with the 5 selected eligible States, a pilot program to 
streamline the process of application to determine the need and 
eligibility of a student for financial assistance under this title that 
incorporates the following:
            ``(1) An option for students that are enrolled in an 
        institution of higher education in a selected eligible State to 
        submit a single FAFSA at the beginning of the student's 
        postsecondary degree program and receive a determination of 
        financial assistance under this title that shall, on a 
        contingent basis, be valid for not less than 2 years and not 
        more than four years, as determined by the State.
            ``(2) The determination of financial assistance under 
        paragraph (1) shall be made in accordance with part F, except 
        that relevant calculations shall be made using a multi-year 
        average, of two or three years, from the most recent tax years 
        for which data are available. A student may use previously 
        submitted student and parent taxpayer data to prepopulate the 
        electronic version of the FAFSA, as described in section 483(f) 
        of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1090(f)).
            ``(3) As a condition of the continued receipt of financial 
        assistance under this section, the Secretary may require a 
        student who submits the single FAFSA to respond to a short 
        number of questions (which may be determined by the Secretary), 
        on an annual basis, to determine if there is a change in the 
        financial status of the student (such as whether the student or 
        the student's parent has experienced a substantial increase in 
        annual income) in order to ensure that the student continues to 
        receive the appropriate amount of financial assistance under 
        this title.
            ``(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a requirement that 
        students who experience significant changes in their financial 
        circumstances, as determined by the Secretary, will be required 
        to resubmit the FAFSA in order to receive a new determination 
        of financial assistance under this title.
            ``(5) An income verification process--
                    ``(A) which the Secretary, through the 
                establishment of a memorandum of understanding with the 
                Secretary of the Treasury, will develop to share the 
                income tax data of a random sample of students who have 
                received Federal assistance under this title, including 
                Federal Pell Grants under section 401 and loans made 
                under part D;
                    ``(B) to ensure that students who have not 
                resubmitted a FAFSA in accordance with paragraph (4) 
                did not have a significant change in financial 
                circumstances that would have required them to do so;
                    ``(C) that shall be carried out in a way so as to 
                ensure that no personally identifiable information is 
                made public through the income verification process; 
                and
                    ``(D) that will be carried out only with the 
                consent of students, whose consent will be requested as 
                part of the annual response required under paragraph 
                (3).
            ``(6) An option for students to request professional 
        judgment or resubmit their FAFSA each year, to receive a new 
        determination of eligibility for financial assistance under 
        this title.
    ``(e) Grant Amount.--Selected eligible States that receive a grant 
under this section shall use grant funds to increase public awareness 
of, and promote the use of, the single FAFSA that may be submitted 
under the pilot program to be used for application to determine the 
need and eligibility of the student for financial assistance under this 
title during the official length of the student's proposed 
postsecondary degree program.
    ``(f) Supplement Not Supplant.--The grants provided under this 
section shall be used to supplement, and not supplant, State funds that 
are used to improve college access and affordability.
    ``(g) Evaluation.--Not later than 3 years after the date of 
enactment of the Higher Education Affordability Act, and 5 years 
thereafter, the Secretary shall prepare and submit to the authorizing 
committees a report that contains an evaluation of the effectiveness of 
the pilot program under this section in improving college access, 
increasing FAFSA submission rates, and increasing postsecondary 
education credit and course accumulation.''.

SEC. 484. ABILITY TO BENEFIT.

    (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 484 (20 U.S.C. 1091) is 
amended to read as follows:

        1, 3, and 4 of part A and parts B, C, D, and E of this title,

                        benefit from the education or training being 
                        offered. Such examination shall be approved by

                        process as the State shall prescribe. Any such

                        process. In determining whether to approve or 
                        disapprove such process, the Secretary shall

                        process in enabling students without high 
                        school diplomas or the equivalent thereof to

        the delivery of higher education for institutions of higher 
        education wishing to participate in programs under title IV of 
        the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.); and
            (2) the ban on incentive compensation under section 
        487(a)(20) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
        1094(a)(20)), as amended by subsection (b), is intended to

        mail, return receipt requested), withhold funds from the 
        institution or its students and withdraw the institution's 
        authority to obligate funds under any program under this title,

                termination.
            ``(2) Time limitation.--An emergency action described in

        unwarranted and should be lifted.
    ``(g) Lifting of Sanctions.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
this title, an institution of higher education that has been sanctioned 
by the Secretary under this section or any other provision of this

        time (determined on the basis of the quotient of the sum of the 
        credit hours of all part-time students divided by 12) at such 
        institutions. The Secretary may establish a methodology for

                such payment may be treated as late for any other 
                purposes, if the payment is received by the transferor 
                servicer (rather than the transferee servicer who

postsecondary education loan that refinances all or any portion of such 
existing loan or debt.

        may be charged to a borrower under a postsecondary education 
        loan relating to an insufficient payment if the payment is made 
        on or before the due date of the payment, or within any 
        applicable grace period for the payment, if the insufficiency 
        is attributable only to a late fee relating to an earlier 
        payment, and the payment is otherwise a full payment for the 
        applicable period.

            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Education shall establish 
        an Institutional Risk-Sharing Commission (referred to in this 
        section as the ``Commission'') whose members shall be selected 
        by the Secretary and comprised of the following relevant 
        stakeholders:
                    (A) 2 representatives of national or regional

                Protection with demonstrated knowledge of student loan 
                borrowing and an alternate member.
                    (D) 2 administrative officers from different types 
                of institutions of higher education and an alternate 
                member.
                    (E) 1 higher education researcher and an alternate 
                member.
                    (F) 1 State postsecondary education data system 
                director and an alternate member.

        Commission is unable to form agreement on the contents of the 
        report by majority vote, the contents of the report shall be 
        determined by a plurality vote.
    (b) Study.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 270 days after the date 
        that all members of the Commission have been selected under 
        subsection (a), the Commission shall complete a study and 
        develop recommendations for implementation of a new risk-
        sharing system for institutions of higher education that 
        participate in the Federal Direct Loan Program under part D of 
        title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a 
        et seq.) through which institutions would be held financially 
        accountable for poor student outcomes.
            (2) Content of study.--In conducting the study required 
        under paragraph (1), the Commission shall, at a minimum, 
        consider the following issues:
                    (A) Identifying an annual measure or set of 
                measures for the risk-sharing system that would provide 
                the most accurate assessment of an institution's level 
                of success or failure at providing their students with 
                basic educational outcomes, such as degree completion, 
                ability to repay loans made, insured, or guaranteed 
                under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
                U.S.C. 1070 et seq.), post-graduation employment, and 
                post-graduation earnings. Such possible measures may 
                include cohort default rates, loan repayment rates, 
                graduation rates, graduate earnings, and other measure 
                that the Commission considers an accurate reflection of 
                student outcomes, regardless of the feasibility of 
                access to the data required to implement collection of 
                such measures.
                    (B) What specific metrics would require the lowest 
                performing institutions to make annual payments into 
                the risk-sharing system, and what metrics would exempt 
                institutions from making an annual risk-sharing payment 
                based on performance measures that exceeded a minimum 
                level (which level would be identified by the 
                Commission).
                    (C) How the payments for each institution should be 
                calculated, including whether the use of a percentage 
                of Federal Direct Loans disbursed the year prior to 
                identification, the percentage of loans in default, or 
                any other calculation should be used.
                    (D) Whether a sliding scale of payments should be 
                required of institutions based on their performance on 
                the identified measures.
                    (E) Any legislative safeguards or mechanisms to 
                ensure that an institution required to participate in 
                the risk-sharing system would not pass any prospective 
                costs directly or indirectly onto students, or limit 
                access to low-income students.
                    (F) How an institution's level of access to low-
                income students (such as measured by the percentage of 
                students enrolled at the institution who receive 
                Federal Pell Grants under subpart 1 of part A of title 
                IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a 
                et seq.)) and affordability (as measured by average net 
                price) should be considered in the risk-sharing system.
                    (G) Specifying a means for the risk-sharing system 
                payments to go primarily towards students in default, 
                additional aid to low-income students, or any other 
                form of aid to student borrowers most in need, 
                including after degree completion.
                    (H) Whether any extraordinary consideration exists 
                that warrants allowing a waiver process through which a 
                very limited number of institutions would be eligible 
                to apply for a waiver from a risk-sharing payment on a 
                yearly basis, and under what conditions.
            (3) Outside recommendations.--As part of the study required 
        under paragraph (1), the Commission shall develop a public 
        process for soliciting recommendations for the risk-sharing 
        system and shall consider these recommendations as part of the 
        study. The Commission shall factor in any financial or other 
        interests of any submitting party in weighing and considering 
        such recommendations.
            (4) Report.--
                    (A) Content.--Not later than 90 days after 
                completing the study required under paragraph (1), the 
                Commission shall issue, by majority vote, or if unable 
                to achieve a majority vote, then a plurality vote, a 
                report regarding its recommendations for a risk-sharing 
                system. The report shall include the following:
                            (i) A description of the Commission's 
                        findings as to the issues described in 
                        paragraph (2).
                            (ii) A data analysis using the Commission's 
                        recommended metrics that demonstrates how each 
                        institution of higher education that 
                        participates in the Federal Direct Loan Program 
                        under part D of title IV of the Higher 
                        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) 
                        as of the period of the Commission's study 
                        would fare under the proposed risk-sharing 
                        system, including projections for the amounts 
                        of payments the lowest performing institutions 
                        would have to pay.
                            (iii) An evaluation of the feasibility and 
                        unintended consequences of implementing the 
                        recommended risk-sharing system, including any 
                        legislative or regulatory action needed to 
                        implement such a system.
                    (B) Availability.--The report described in 
                subparagraph (A) shall be--
                            (i) provided to the Secretary of Education,

SEC. 1110. STUDY ON THE IMPACT OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID CHANGES ON 
              GRADUATE STUDENTS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Education, acting through the Director of 
the Institute of Education Sciences, shall begin conducting a study of 
the impact of recent policy changes to title IV of the Higher Education 
Act of 1965 on graduate students.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of 
significant changes in Federal student financial aid policy on access, 
affordability, and labor market outcomes for graduate students. The 
study shall include an exploration of the impact of the following 
significant changes:
            (1) The authorization of PLUS Loans for graduate students.
            (2) The elimination of Federal Direct Stafford Loans for 
        graduate students.
            (3) The increase in origination fees due to the 
        sequestration order issued under the Balanced Budget and 
        Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900 et seq.) 
        for fiscal year 2013.
            (4) Differentiation in interest rates between undergraduate 
        and graduate Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford loans.
            (5) Changes to the income-based repayment plan described 
        under section 493C (20 U.S.C. 1098e).
    (c) Contents.--The study shall include--
            (1) information about the effects of the changes described 
        in subsection (b) on graduate students, disaggregated by the 
        student's age, race, ethnicity, gender, income, status as an 
        individual with a disability, and type of institution of higher 
        education that the graduate student attended for such student's 
        graduate program (including 2-year or 4-year institution of 
        higher education, public or private institution of higher 
        education, and proprietary or nonprofit institution of higher 
        education); and
            (2) an examination of the effects of the changes described 
        in subsection (b) on--
                    (A) changes in graduate enrollment patterns (such 
                as increases or decreases in enrollment);
                    (B) net tuition and fees for graduate students;
                    (C) the aggregate amount of Federal student loan 
                debt resulting from graduate education, as a whole and 
                disaggregated by each type of Federal loan under title 
                IV;
                    (D) the median level of individual student loan 
                debt that is the result of graduate education (ensuring 
                that the amount of undergraduate student loan debt is 
                distinguished from the amount of graduate student loan 
                debt);
                    (E) default rates, and the range of amounts of 
                unpaid debt, for title IV loans for graduate students;
                    (F) the use of each type of loan repayment plan 
                under title IV, including income-based repayment, and 
                the median level of graduate student debt for 
                individuals in each repayment plan;
                    (G) the number of individuals who have a graduate 
                degree that enter public service jobs;
                    (H) the level of total educational debt for 
                graduate students, including Federal student loans and 
                private education loans;
                    (I) the correlation between high graduate student 
                debt levels and household consumption (including the 
                purchasing of homes and automobiles) and retirement 
                savings; and
                    (J) such other factors as the Secretary may 
                determine;
            (3) an analysis of how the effects of the changes described 
        in subsection (b) differ according to--
                    (A) whether an individual was or is attending 
                graduate school on a full-time or part-time basis; and
                    (B) whether an individual has or is pursuing a 
                master's degree, a doctorate research degree, or a 
                doctorate professional practice degree;
            (4) a detailed explanation of the impact of such changes on 
        students who were eligible for a Federal Pell Grant as an 
        undergraduate student, women, and traditionally 
        underrepresented populations; and
            (5) policy recommendations designed to improve access, 
        affordability, and labor market outcomes for graduate students.
    (d) Reports.--
            (1) Interim reports.--Not later than 18 months after the 
        commencement of the study described under this section, and 
        annually thereafter, the Secretary shall evaluate the progress 
        of the study and report any short-term findings to the 
        appropriate committees of Congress.
            (2) Final report.--Upon completion of the study described 
        under this section, the Secretary shall prepare and submit a 
        final report regarding the findings of the study to the 
        appropriate committees of Congress.
    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary 
for fiscal year 2015 and each of the 4 succeeding fiscal years.
