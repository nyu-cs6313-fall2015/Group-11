 To require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to employ at least three 
 decision review officers at each regional office of the Department of 
               Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Appeals Improvement Act of 
2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Section 7101(a) of title 38, United States Code, 
        requires that the Board of Veterans' Appeals have such number 
        of members and staff as may be found necessary in order to 
        conduct hearings and dispose of appeals properly before the 
        Board in a timely manner.
            (2) The supporting information submitted along with the 
        budget under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, for 
        fiscal year 2015 for the Department of Veterans Affairs states 
        that appeals received by the Board of Veterans' Appeals are 
        expected to increase by 52 percent from the 47,763 appeals 
        received in 2011 to 72,786 by the end of 2015.
            (3) The annual report of the Board of Veterans' Appeals for 
        Fiscal Year 2012 indicates that with 64 members, the Board was 
        able to issue 44,300 decisions in that fiscal year.
            (4) The Board also noted in such report that there is a 
        direct and proportional correlation between the number of 
        members and staff of the Board and the number of decisions they 
        can issue.

        of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on 
        Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Veterans'

                three, including an estimate of when at least three 
                decision review officers will be employed at such 
                regional office.
                    (C) A description of the measures that the 
                Secretary plans to take to ensure that appeals properly 
                before the Board of Veterans' Appeals that would 
                normally be disposed of by decision review officers at 
                such regional office are disposed of in a timely manner 
                during the period in which fewer than three decision

the following:
            (1) Whether the number of members of the Board is
