SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Youth Sports Concussion Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) scientific advancements and a greater understanding of 
        the issues that affect the health and safety of young athletes 
        are key to reducing sports-related concussions in youth;
            (2) the National Academies should complete, and make 
        available to the public, its report on sports-related 
        concussions in youth not later than January 31, 2014;
            (3) the Consumer Product Safety Commission should review 
        the National Academies' report for any matter that may impact 
        products under the Commission's jurisdiction;
            (4) if protective equipment manufacturers choose to adopt 
        voluntary consumer product safety standards based on the 
        National Academies' report and any related Consumer Product 
        Safety Commission recommendations, the voluntary standards 
        should include mechanisms to ensure substantial compliance by 
        covered entities; and
            (5) the Federal Trade Commission should review the National 
        Academies' report for any matter that may inform efforts to 
        protect consumers from unfair or deceptive practices in or 
        affecting commerce.

SEC. 3. THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES' REPORT ON SPORTS-RELATED CONCUSSIONS IN 
              YOUTH.

    (a) Review.--The Consumer Product Safety Commission--
            (1) shall review the National Academies' report on sports-
        related concussion in youth not later than 5 months after the 
        completion of such report; and
            (2) may make recommendations to protective equipment 
        manufacturers regarding whether voluntary standards should be 
        adopted--
                    (A) to reduce the risk of sports-related injury for 
                youth athletes wearing protective equipment;
                    (B) to improve the safety of reconditioned
