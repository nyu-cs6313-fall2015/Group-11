                                 A BILL


 
To restrict the ability of the Federal Government to undermine privacy 
 and encryption technology in commercial products and in NIST computer 
                   security and encryption standards.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Digital Security and 
Commerce Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States is the world leader in technology, 
        encryption, and computer security.
            (2) The United States Government, through the expert work 
        of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (referred 
        to in this section as ``NIST'') and the Information Assurance 
        Directorate of the National Security Agency, plays a vital role 
        in developing the tools that keep global electronic 
        communications secure.
            (3) The United States Government should actively promote 
        privacy and computer security. Allegations that entities within 
        the United States Government seek to undermine the security of 
        encryption standards or commercial products weaken privacy and 
        erode trust in the United States Government and in products 
        from the United States.
            (4) The actions described in paragraph (3) may take a 
        serious toll on the United States economy. The Information 
        Technology and Innovation Foundation has predicted that United 
        States companies may lose 10 percent of the cloud computing 
        market to overseas competitors due to surveillance and security 
        concerns, a loss that could amount to not less than 
        $35,000,000,000 in lost sales by 2016.
            (5) The cryptographic expertise of NIST is recognized 
        around the world, but widespread adoption of the robust 
        encryption standards that NIST develops depends on trust.
            (6) To promote privacy protection and restore trust in the 
        encryption standards of the United States and hardware and 
        software from the United States, the United States Government 
        should be prohibited from undermining the security of the 
        United States technologies on which global commerce relies.

                which any agency or office of the Federal Government

                (f); and

                following:
    ``(e) Each agency or office that the Institute consults with under 
subsection (c)(1) may not intentionally weaken, circumvent, undermine, 
or create any mechanism through which any agency or office of the 
Federal Government may bypass, the privacy, security, or encryption 
protections included in any standard or guideline required under 
subsection (a) or (b).''.

                and Privacy Advisory Board under section 21''; and
                    (B) in subsection (e)(1), by striking ``Computer 
                System Security and Privacy Advisory Board'' and 
                inserting ``Information Security and Privacy Advisory 
                Board under section 21''.
