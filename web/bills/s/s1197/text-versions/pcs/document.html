SEC. 152. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE UNITED STATES HELICOPTER INDUSTRIAL 
              BASE.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) Armed, cargo, and utility helicopters provide the 
        Department of Defense with critical capabilities to support 
        operations in the air, on land, and at sea.
            (2) According to the Aerospace Industries Association of 
        America's 2012 Year-End Review and Forecast, the United States 
        military aircraft manufacturing sales declined by 2.4 percent 
        between 2011 and 2012.
            (3) According to the Aerospace Industries Association of 
        America's July 2012 report on the aerospace industrial base, 
        aviation industry employment of aerospace research and 
        development scientists and engineers numbering 140,000 in 1996 
        has declined to 40,000 in 2008.
            (4) Today, five corporations manufacture all United States 
        military helicopters.
            (5) Helicopter program unpredictability and reduced defense 
        procurement have a negative impact on the ability to recruit 
        and retain a qualified and capable aerospace workforce thereby 
        increasing risk for the helicopter industrial base's ability to 
        design, build, and support the next generation of manned and 
        unmanned military helicopters.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) armed, cargo, and utility helicopters are instrumental 
        to the Department of Defense's ability to execute the 
        President's National Security Strategy;
            (2) the Department of Defense should take into 
        consideration the health and viability of the military 
        helicopter industrial base in its analysis and decision making 
        when building its annual research, development, and acquisition 
        budget request; and
            (3) the Department of Defense and Congress should endeavor 
        to maintain budget and program predictability in order to 
        attract and retain a skilled workforce to ensure the 
        technological capabilities required to sustain the preeminence 
        of the United States military helicopter fleets.

                  Subtitle C--Missile Defense Programs

SEC. 231. HOMELAND BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Ballistic Missile Defense Review of February 2010 
        stated as its first policy priority that ``the United States 
        will continue to defend the homeland against the threat of 
        limited ballistic missile attack'' and that ``an essential 
        element of the United States' homeland ballistic missile 
        defense strategy is to hedge against future uncertainties, 
        including both the uncertainty of future threat capabilities 
        and the technical risks inherent to our own development 
        plans''.
            (2) The United States currently has an operational Ground-
        based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system with 30 Ground-Based 
        Interceptors (GBIs) deployed in Alaska and California, 
        protecting all of the United States, including the East Coast, 
        against the threat of limited ballistic missile attack from 
        both North Korea and Iran. During 2013, senior military and 
        civilian defense leaders have stated repeatedly that they have 
        confidence in the ability of the current Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system to protect the United States from limited 
        ballistic missile attack from North Korea and Iran.
            (3) On March 15, 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel 
        announced a series of planned steps to enhance United States 
        homeland ballistic missile defense, to stay ahead of the future 
        missile threat from North Korea and Iran. These steps include 
        the deployment of 14 additional Ground-Based Interceptors at 
        Fort Greely, Alaska, by 2017, a nearly 50 percent increase in 
        the number of such interceptors deployed by the United States.
            (4) In response to provocative behavior and public threats 
        by North Korea to launch missiles at the United States, the 
        Department of Defense took a number of actions to enhance 
        United States homeland missile defense capabilities, including 
        deployment of the Sea-Based X-band radar into the Pacific 
        Ocean.
            (5) Before the March 15, 2013, announcement by Secretary of 
        Defense Hagel, General Robert Kehler, Commander of the United 
        States Strategic Command, testified that ``I am confident that 
        we can defend against a limited attack from Iran, although we 
        are not in the most optimum posture to do that today. . . it 
        doesn't provide total defense today''. Shortly after the 
        announcement by Secretary Hagel, General Charles Jacoby, 
        Commander of the United States Northern Command, testified that 
        ``we have the capability of limited defense right now. And I 
        think it's not optimum and I think that we've made some 
        important steps forward in what was rolled out. And I think we 
        need to continue to assess the threat and make sure we stay 
        ahead of it''.
            (6) As its highest near-term priority, the Missile Defense 
        Agency is designing a correction to the problem that caused a 
        December 2010 flight test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system using the Capability Enhancement-II (CE-II) 
        model of exo-atmospheric kill vehicle, and plans to demonstrate 
        the correction through flight testing, including an intercept 
        test, before resuming production, assembly, or refurbishment of 
        additional Capability Enhancement-II kill vehicles.
            (7) The Department of Defense has a program to improve the 
        performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system. According to Department officials, the goal of 
        the Ground-Based Interceptor reliability program is to double 
        the number of threat Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles 
        (ICBMs) that the current United States inventory of Ground-
        Based Interceptors could defeat, thereby effectively doubling 
        the capability of the current Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system.
            (8) The Missile Defense Agency, working with the Director 
        of Operational Test and Evaluation and with United States 
        Strategic Command, has developed a comprehensive Integrated 
        Master Test Plan (IMTP) for missile defense, with flight tests 
        for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system planned through 
        fiscal year 2023, including salvo testing, multiple 
        simultaneous engagement testing, and operational testing. The 
        current test plan includes an additional intercept flight test 
        using the Capability Enhancement-I kill vehicle, scheduled for 
        mid-2013, to demonstrate the reliability enhancements to 
        Ground-Based Interceptors quipped with that kill vehicle. The 
        Director of Operational Test and Evaluation reviewed and 
        approved the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system test plan 
        and pace, including the plan to demonstrate the correction of 
        the Capability Enhancement-II kill vehicle.
            (9) In May, 2013, Vice Admiral James Syring, the Director 
        of the Missile Defense Agency, testified to Congress that he is 
        seeking to improve the performance and reliability of the 
        Ground-Based Interceptors, and to make the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense system ``more operationally effective and 
        cost-effective'', including by improving its sensors, 
        discrimination, kill assessment, and battle management. He 
        testified that these improvements are ``absolutely needed'' and 
        are ``equally important to interceptors'' in terms of staying 
        ahead of the threat.
            (10) As part of its United States homeland defense hedging 
        strategy, the Department of Defense has already decided upon or 
        implemented a number of actions to improve the missile defense 
        posture of the United States to stay ahead of the evolving 
        threat of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles from North Korea 
        and Iran. These include the following actions:
                    (A) As announced by Secretary of Defense Hagel, the 
                Department plans to deploy 14 additional Ground-Based 
                Interceptors at Fort Greely, Alaska, by 2017, to deploy 
                a second AN/TPY-2 radar in Japan, and to pursue an 
                advanced kill vehicle technology development program.
                    (B) The Missile Defense Agency has completed 
                construction of Missile Field-2 at Fort Greely, Alaska, 
                with eight extra silos available to deploy the 
                additional operational Ground-Based Interceptors 
                announced by Secretary of Defense Hagel.
                    (C) The Department plans to refurbish the 6 
                prototype silos in Missile Field-1 at Fort Greely, 
                Alaska, to deploy the additional Ground-Based 
                Interceptors announced by Secretary of Defense Hagel.
                    (D) The Missile Defense Agency plans to deploy an 
                in-flight interceptor communication system data 
                terminal at Fort Drum, New York, to enhance the 
                performance of Ground-Based Interceptors defending the 
                eastern United States against possible future missile 
                threats from Iran.
                    (E) The Missile Defense Agency is continuing the 
                development and testing of the two-stage Ground-Based 
                Interceptor for possible deployment in the future, if 
                needed.
                    (F) The Missile Defense Agency plans to upgrade the 
                early warning radars in Clear, Alaska, and Cape Cod, 
                Massachusetts, to enhance the ability to defend the 
                United States homeland against potential future 
                Intercontinental Ballistic Missile threats from North 
                Korea and Iran.
                    (G) The Missile Defense Agency is evaluating sites 
                for a possible future United States homeland ballistic 
                missile defense interceptor site in the United States, 
                in compliance with section 227 of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Public Law 112-
                239), and will complete an Environmental Impact 
                Statement for the best suited sites by early 2016, in 
                case the President decides to proceed with the 
                deployment of such a site.
            (11) As part of its United States homeland missile defense 
        hedging strategy, the Department of Defense is considering 
        additional options to enhance the future United States posture 
        and capability to defend the homeland, including the 
        feasibility, advisability, and affordability of deploying 
        additional Ground-Based Interceptors beyond the 14 Ground-Based 
        Interceptors announced by Secretary of Defense Hagel, including 
        possibly at a missile defense site on the East Coast of the 
        United States.
            (12) In discussing the possible benefits of a potential 
        additional missile defense interceptor site in the United 
        States, General Jacoby testified that ``exploring a third site 
        is an important next step. What a third site gives me, whether 
        it's on the East Coast or an alternate location, would be 
        increased battle space. That means increased opportunity for me 
        to engage threats from either Iran or North Korea''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is a national priority to defend the United States 
        homeland against the threat of limited ballistic missile attack 
        from North Korea and Iran;
            (2) the currently deployed Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system, with 30 Ground-Based Interceptors deployed in Alaska 
        and California, provides protection of the entire United States 
        homeland, including the East Coast, against the threat of 
        limited ballistic missile attack from North Korea and Iran, 
        although this capability can and should be improved;;
            (3) it is essential for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system to achieve the levels of reliability, availability, 
        sustainability, and operational performance that will allow it 
        to continue providing protection of the United States homeland 
        against limited ballistic missile attack and to stay ahead of 
        the threat as it develops;
            (4) the Missile Defense Agency should, as its highest 
        priority, correct the problem that caused the December 2010 
        Ground-based Midcourse Defense system flight test failure and 
        demonstrate the correction through flight testing, including a 
        successful intercept test, before resuming production of the 
        Capability Enhancement-II kill vehicle, in order to provide 
        confidence that the system will work as intended;
            (5) the Department of Defense should continue to enhance 
        the performance and reliability of the Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system, and enhance the capability of the Ballistic 
        Missile Defense System (including through improved sensors, 
        discrimination, kill assessment, exo-atmospheric kill vehicles, 
        and battle management) to provide improved capability to defend 
        the United States homeland against the evolving missile threats 
        from North Korea and Iran;
            (6) the Missile Defense Agency should continue its robust, 
        rigorous, and realistic testing of the Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system, as described in the Integrated Master Test 
        Plan, including salvo testing, multiple simultaneous engagement 
        testing, and operational testing;
            (7) the Department of Defense has taken a number of 
        prudent, affordable, cost-effective, and operationally 
        significant steps to hedge against the possibility of future 
        growth in the ballistic missile threat to the United States 
        homeland from North Korea and Iran, including the planned 
        deployment of 14 additional Ground-Based Interceptors; and
            (8) the Department of Defense should continue to evaluate 
        the evolving long-range missile threat from North Korea and 
        Iran and consider further possibilities for prudent, 
        affordable, cost-effective, and operationally significant steps 
        to improve the posture of the United States to defend the 
        United States homeland against possible future growth in the 
        threat from North Korea and Iran.

SEC. 232. REGIONAL BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the introduction to the Ballistic Missile Defense 
        Review of February 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 
        wrote that ``I have made defending against near-term regional 
        threats a top priority of our missile defense plans, programs 
        and capabilities''.
            (2) In describing the threat of regional ballistic 
        missiles, the report of the Ballistic Missile Defense Review 
        stated that ``there is no uncertainty about the existence of 
        regional threats. They are clear and present. The threat from 
        short-range, medium-range, and intermediate-range ballistic 
        missiles (SRBMs, MRBMs, and IRBMs) in regions where the United 
        States deploys forces and maintains security relationships is 
        growing at a particularly rapid pace''.
            (3) North Korea has hundreds of regional ballistic 
        missiles, including short-range Scud missiles and medium-range 
        Nodong missiles. North Korea also has publicly displayed, but 
        not flight-tested, intermediate-range Musudan missiles. These 
        regional missiles can reach United States forces and allies in 
        South Korea and Japan, and perhaps Guam. In the spring of 2013, 
        North Korea made public threats to use nuclear weapons and 
        ballistic missiles against South Korea, Japan, and Guam.
            (4) In response to these threats from North Korea, the 
        United States deployed Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships, 
        armed with Standard Missile-3 interceptors, to the waters near 
        the Korean Peninsula, and a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense 
        (THAAD) battery to Guam. It also deployed the Sea-Based X-band 
        missile defense radar into the Pacific Ocean to enhance United 
        States missile defense capabilities. On March 15, 2013, 
        Secretary of Defense Hagel announced a series of planned steps 
        to enhance missile defense, including the deployment of a 
        second AN/TPY-2 missile defense radar in Japan to improve 
        regional and homeland defense against North Korean missiles. As 
        part of their response to the provocations of North Korea, 
        South Korea deployed vessels equipped with Aegis missile 
        defense radars, and Japan deployed its Aegis Ballistic Missile 
        Defense ships, equipped with Standard Missile-3 interceptors.
            (5) Iran has the largest inventory of regional ballistic 
        missiles in the Middle East, with hundreds of missiles that can 
        reach as far as southeastern Europe and all of the Middle East, 
        including Israel. Iran is improving its existing missiles and 
        developing new and longer-range regional missiles.
            (6) In September 2009, President Barack Obama announced 
        that he had accepted the unanimous recommendation of the 
        Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to establish 
        a European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA) to missile defense, 
        designed to protect deployed United States forces, allies, and 
        partners in Europe against the large and growing threat of 
        ballistic missiles from Iran.
            (7) In November 2010, at the Lisbon Summit, the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to adopt the core 
        mission of missile defense of its population, territory, and 
        forces. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to 
        enhance its missile defense command and control system, the 
        Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense, to provide a 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization command and control 
        capability. This is in addition to voluntary contributions of 
        missile defense capabilities from individual nations.
            (8) During 2011, the United States successfully implemented 
        Phase 1 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, including 
        deployment of an AN/TPY-2 radar in Turkey, deployment of an 
        Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ship in the eastern 
        Mediterranean Sea with Standard Missile-3 Block IA 
        interceptors, and the establishment of a missile defense 
        command and control system in Germany.
            (9) Phase 2 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is 
        planned for deployment around 2015, and is planned to include 
        the deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IB interceptors on 
        Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore 
        site in Romania.
            (10) Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach is 
        planned for deployment around 2018, and is planned to include 
        the deployment of Standard Missile-3 Block IIA interceptors on 
        Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships and at an Aegis Ashore 
        site in Poland.
            (11) At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit in 
        Chicago in May 2012, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        announced it had achieved an ``interim capability'' for the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile defense system, 
        including initial capability of its Active Layered Theater 
        Ballistic Missile Defense system at a command and control 
        facility in Germany.
            (12) The United States has a robust program of missile 
        defense cooperation with Israel, including joint development of 
        the Arrow Weapon System and the new Arrow-3 interceptor, 
        designed to defend Israel against ballistic missiles from Iran. 
        These jointly developed missile defense systems are designed to 
        be interoperable with United States ballistic missile defenses, 
        and these interoperable systems are tested in large joint 
        military exercises, such as ``Austere Challenge'' in 2012. The 
        United States has also deployed an AN/TPY-2 radar in Israel to 
        enhance missile defense against missiles from Iran.
            (13) The United States is working with the nations of the 
        Gulf Cooperation Council on enhanced national and regional 
        missile defense capabilities against the growing missile threat 
        from Iran. As part of this effort, the United Arab Emirates 
        plans to purchase two Terminal High Altitude Area Defense 
        batteries, as well as other equipment. During 2012, the United 
        States deployed an AN/TPY-2 radar in the United States Central 
        Command area of responsibility to enhance missile defense 
        capability of forward-deployed United States forces, allies, 
        and partners against missiles from Iran.
            (14) The United States has a strong program of missile 
        defense cooperation with Japan, including the co-development of 
        the Standard Missile-3 Block IIA interceptor for the Aegis 
        Ballistic Missile Defense system, intended to be deployed in 
        Phase 3 of the European Phased Adaptive Approach, the Japanese 
        fleet of Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense ships using Standard 
        Missile-3 Block IA interceptors, and the United States 
        deployment of two AN/TPY-2 radars in Japan.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the threat from regional ballistic missiles, 
        particularly from North Korea and Iran, is serious and growing, 
        and puts at risk forward-deployed United States forces, allies, 
        and partners in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, and the Middle 
        East;
            (2) the Department of Defense has an obligation to provide 
        force protection of forward-deployed United States forces and 
        facilities from regional ballistic missile attack;
            (3) the United States has an obligation to meet its 
        security commitments to its allies, including ballistic missile 
        defense commitments;
            (4) the Department of Defense has a balanced program of 
        investment and capabilities to provide for both homeland 
        defense and regional defense against ballistic missiles, 
        consistent with the Ballistic Missile Defense Review and with 
        the prioritized and integrated needs of the commanders of the 
        combatant commands;
            (5) elements of United States regional missile defenses 
        enhance and enable the homeland defense capabilities of the 
        United States, including forward-deployed radars and defense of 
        critical forward-deployed missile defense systems;
            (6) the European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile 
        defense is an appropriate and prudent response to the existing 
        and growing ballistic missile threat from Iran to forward-
        deployed United States forces, allies, and partners in Europe;
            (7) the Department of Defense should, as a high priority, 
        continue to develop, test, and plan to deploy Phases 2 and 3 of 
        the European Phased Adaptive Approach, including the planned 
        Aegis Ashore sites in Romania and Poland;
            (8) the Department of Defense should also continue with its 
        other phased and adaptive regional missile defense efforts 
        tailored to the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region;
            (9) European members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization are making valuable contributions to missile 
        defense in Europe, by hosting elements of United States missile 
        defense systems on their territories, through individual 
        national contributions to missile defense capability, and by 
        collective funding and development of the Active Layered 
        Theater Ballistic Missile Defense system;
            (10) the actions taken by the Department of Defense to 
        improve its regional missile defense posture in response to the 
        provocative actions and threats of North Korea were prudent and 
        appropriate and demonstrated the flexible and adaptive nature 
        of its regional missile defense capabilities, which allows for 
        surge deployments to meet regional contingencies in a timely 
        manner; and
            (11) Japan and South Korea are making notable progress in 
        enhancing their missile defense capabilities, in partnership 
        with the United States, to protect against regional missiles 
        from North Korea.

                assessments.
            (3) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified 
        annex.

SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) For more than a decade, the United States and Russia 
        have discussed a variety of options for cooperation on shared 
        early warning and ballistic missile defense. For example, on 
        May 1, 2001, President George W. Bush spoke of a ``new 
        cooperative relationship'' with Russia and said ``it should be 
        premised on openness, mutual confidence and real opportunities 
        for cooperation, including the area of missile defense. It 
        should allow us to share information so that each nation can 
        improve its early warning capability, and its capability to 
        defend its people and territory. And perhaps one day, we can 
        even cooperate in a joint defense''.
            (2) Section 1231 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law by 
        Public Law 106-398; 1654A-329) authorized the Department of 
        Defense to establish in Russia a ``joint center for the 
        exchange of data from systems to provide early warning of 
        launches of ballistic missiles and for notification of launches 
        of such missiles'', also known as the Joint Data Exchange 
        Center (JDEC).
            (3) On March 31, 2008, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon 
        England stated that ``we have offered Russia a wide-ranging 
        proposal to cooperate on missile defense--everything from 
        modeling and simulation, to data sharing, to joint development 
        of a regional missile defense architecture--all designed to 
        defend the United States, Europe, and Russia from the growing 
        threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. An extraordinary series 
        of transparency measures have also been offered to reassure 
        Russia. Despite some Russian reluctance to sign up to these 
        cooperative missile defense activities, we continue to work 
        toward this goal''.
            (4) The February 2010 report of the Ballistic Missile 
        Defense Review established as one of its central policy pillars 
        that increased international missile defense cooperation is in 
        the national security interest of the United States and, with 
        regard to cooperation with Russia, the United States ``is 
        pursuing a broad agenda focused on shared early warning of 
        missile launches, possible technical cooperation, and even 
        operational cooperation''.
            (5) At the November 2010 Lisbon Summit, the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to develop a missile defense 
        system to ``protect NATO European populations, territory and 
        forces'' and also to seek cooperation with Russia on missile 
        defense. In its Lisbon Summit Declaration, the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization reaffirmed its readiness to ``invite Russia 
        to explore jointly the potential for linking current and 
        planned missile defense systems at an appropriate time in 
        mutually beneficial ways''. The new NATO Strategic Concept 
        adopted at the Lisbon Summit stated that ``we will actively 
        seek cooperation on missile defense with Russia'', that ``NATO-
        Russia cooperation is of strategic importance'', and that ``the 
        security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia 
        is intertwined''.
            (6) In a December 18, 2010, letter to the leadership of the 
        Senate, President Obama wrote that the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization ``invited Russia to cooperate on missile defense, 
        which could lead to adding Russian capabilities to those 
        deployed by NATO to enhance our common security against common 
        threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the 
        Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving 
        NATO-Russian relations. This comes even as we have made clear 
        that the system we intend to pursue with Russia will not be a 
        joint system, and it will not in any way limit United States' 
        or NATO's missile defense capabilities. Effective cooperation 
        with Russia could enhance the overall efficiency of our 
        combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time 
        provide Russia with greater security''.
            (7) Section 221(a)(3) of the Ike Skelton National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; 124 
        Stat. 4167) states that it is the sense of Congress ``to 
        support the efforts of the United States Government and the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization to pursue cooperation with 
        the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense relative to 
        Iranian missile threats''.
            (8) In a speech in Russia on March 21, 2011, Secretary of 
        Defense Robert Gates cited ``the NATO-Russian decision to 
        cooperate on defense against ballistic missiles. We've 
        disagreed before, and Russia still has uncertainties about the 
        European Phased Adaptive Approach, a limited system that poses 
        no challenges to the large Russian nuclear arsenal. However, 
        we've mutually committed to resolving these difficulties in 
        order to develop a roadmap toward truly effective anti-
        ballistic missile collaboration. This collaboration may include 
        exchanging launch information, setting up a joint data fusion 
        center, allowing greater transparency with respect to our 
        missile defense plans and exercises, and conducting a joint 
        analysis to determine areas of future cooperation''.
            (9) In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of the 
        Senate on April 13, 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
        for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy Bradley H. Roberts 
        stated that the United States has been pursuing a Defense 
        Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia since 2004, and 
        that such an agreement is necessary ``for the safeguarding of 
        sensitive information in support of cooperation'' on missile 
        defense, and to ``provide the legal framework for undertaking 
        cooperative efforts''.
            (10) In a March 2012 answer to a question from the 
        Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on missile defense 
        cooperation with Russia, Acting Under Secretary of Defense for 
        Policy Jim Miller wrote that ``I support U.S.-Russian 
        cooperation on missile defenses first and foremost because it 
        could improve the effectiveness of U.S. and NATO missile 
        defenses, thereby improving the protection of the United 
        States, our forces overseas, and our Allies. Missile defense 
        cooperation with Russia is in the security interests of the 
        United States, NATO, and Russia, first and foremost because it 
        could strengthen capabilities across Europe to intercept 
        Iranian missiles''. He also wrote that ``[t]he United States 
        has pursued missile defense cooperation with Russia with the 
        clear understanding that we would not accept constraints on 
        missile defense, and that we would undertake necessary 
        qualitative and quantitative improvements to meet U.S. Security 
        needs''.
            (11) In February 2012, an international group of 
        independent experts known as the Euro-Atlantic Security 
        Initiative issued a report proposing missile defense 
        cooperation between the United States (with its North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization allies) and Russia. The group, whose 
        leaders included Stephen Hadley, the National Security Advisor 
        to President George W. Bush, proposed that the nations share 
        satellite and radar early warning data at joint cooperation 
        centers in order to improve their ability to detect, track, and 
        defeat medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles 
        from the Middle East.
            (12) In a letter dated April 13, 2012, Robert Nabors, 
        Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of 
        Legislative Affairs, wrote that ``it is Administration policy 
        that we will only provide information to Russia that will 
        enhance the effectiveness of our missile defenses. The 
        Administration will not provide Russia with sensitive 
        information that would in any way compromise our national 
        security, including hit-to-kill technology and interceptor 
        telemetry''.
            (13) The May 20, 2012, NATO Chicago Summit Declaration 
        included the following statement: ``Given our shared security 
        interests with Russia, we remain committed to cooperation on 
        missile defense in the spirit of mutual trust and reciprocity, 
        such as the recent [NATO-Russia Council] Theatre Missile 
        Defense Exercise. Through ongoing efforts in the NATO-Russia 
        Council, we seek to determine how independent NATO and Russian 
        missile defense systems can work together to enhance European 
        security. We look forward to establishing the proposed joint 
        NATO-Russia Missile Data Fusion Centre and the joint Planning 
        Operations Centre to cooperate on missile defense. We propose 
        to develop a transparency regime based upon a regular exchange 
        of information about the current respective missile defense 
        capabilities of NATO and Russia''.
            (14) The United States currently has agreements and 
        programs of cooperation on shared early warning with eight 
        nations in addition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
        The United States has developed procedures and mechanisms for 
        sharing early warning information with partner nations while 
        ensuring the protection of sensitive United States information.
            (15) Russia and the United States each have ballistic 
        missile launch early warning and detection and tracking sensors 
        that could contribute to and enhance each others' ability to 
        detect, track, and defend against ballistic missile threats 
        from Iran.
            (16) The Obama Administration has provided regular 
        briefings to Congress on its discussions with Russia on 
        possible missile defense cooperation.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with 
        Russia that would enhance the security of the United States, 
        its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, and Russia, 
        particularly against missile threats from Iran;
            (2) the United States should pursue ballistic missile 
        defense cooperation with Russia on both a bilateral basis and a 
        multilateral basis with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        allies, particularly through the NATO-Russia Council, when it 
        is in the national security interests of the United States to 
        do so;
            (3) missile defense cooperation with Russia should not ``in 
        any way limit United States' or NATO's missile defense 
        capabilities'', as acknowledged in the December 18, 2010, 
        letter from President Obama to the leadership of the Senate, 
        and should be mutually beneficial and reciprocal in nature;
            (4) the United States should not provide Russia with 
        sensitive missile defense information that would in any way 
        compromise United States national security, including ``hit-to-
        kill'' technology and interceptor telemetry;
            (5) the United States should pursue missile defense 
        cooperation with Russia in a manner that ensures that--
                    (A) United States classified information is 
                appropriately safeguarded and protected from 
                unauthorized disclosure;
                    (B) prior to entering into missile defense 
                technology cooperation projects, the United States 
                enters into a Defense Technology Cooperation Agreement 
                with Russia that establishes the legal framework for a 
                broad spectrum of potential cooperative defense 
                projects; and
                    (C) such cooperation does not limit the missile 
                defense capabilities of the United States or its North 
                Atlantic Treaty Organization allies; and
            (6) the sovereignty of the United States and its ability to 
        unilaterally pursue its own missile defense program shall be 
        protected.
    (c) Limitation on Use of Funds To Provide Russian Federation Access 
to Certain Missile Defense Information.--No funds authorized to be 
appropriated or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2014 for the 
Department of Defense may be used to provide the Russian Federation 
with sensitive missile defense information that would in any way 
compromise United States national security, including ``hit-to-kill'' 
technology and telemetry data for missile defense interceptors or 
target vehicles.

SEC. 234. ADDITIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE RADAR FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE 
              UNITED STATES HOMELAND.

    (a) In General.--The Missile Defense Agency shall deploy an X-band 
radar, or other comparable sensor, at a location optimized to support 
the defense of the United States homeland against long-range ballistic 
missile threats.
    (b) Funding.--Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by 
section 201 for fiscal year 2014 for the Department of Defense for

        officers on their performance in establishing a command climate 
        as described in paragraph (1) during the regular periodic 
        counseling and performance appraisal process prescribed by the

        martial, the disposition authority should include in the case

        lieu of court-martial members of the Armed Forces who have 
        committed rape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy, or attempts to 
        commit such offenses, and should do so only when the facts of 
        the case clearly warrant such discharge;
            (2) whenever possible, the victims of offenses referred to 
        in paragraph (1) should be consulted prior to the determination 
        regarding whether to discharge the members who committed such

                possession, custody, or control of any documentary 
                material relevant to an investigation under this 
                section, the Attorney General, or a designee, may, 
                before commencing a civil action under subparagraph 
                (A), issue in writing and cause to be served upon such 
                person, a civil investigative demand requiring--
                            ``(i) the production of such documentary 
                        material for inspection and copying;
                            ``(ii) that the custodian of such 
                        documentary material answer in writing written 
                        questions with respect to such documentary

              REIMBURSEMENTS FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDED IN 
              MILITARY MEDICAL TREATMENT FACILITIES.

    (a) Pilot Program.--The Secretary of Defense shall, in coordination 
with the Secretaries of the military departments, carry out a pilot 
program to assess the feasibility and advisability of using processes 
described in subsection (b) to increase the amounts collected under 
section 1095 of title 10, United States Code, from third-party payers 
for charges for health care services incurred by the United States at 
military medical treatment facilities.
    (b) Covered Processes.--The processes described in this subsection 
are commercially available enhanced recovery practices for medical 
payment collection, including rates and percentages of collection in 
accordance with industry standards for such practices.
    (c) Elements.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program so 
as--
            (1) to facilitate the identification and analysis of best 
        practices in connection with the processes described in 
        subsection (b) that are used in nonmilitary health care 
        facilities; and
            (2) to permit a cost-benefit analysis of the processes used 
        under the pilot program, including an analysis of--
                    (A) the amount of third-party collections that 
                resulted from such processes;
                    (B) the cost to implement and sustain such 
                processes; and
                    (C) such other matters as the Secretary considers 
                appropriate for the pilot program.
    (d) Location.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program at 
not less than two military installations of different military 
departments each of which meets the following criteria:
            (1) Such installation has a military medical treatment 
        facility with both inpatient and outpatient capabilities.
            (2) The catchment area of such installation contains a 
        significant-sized military beneficiary population who are

                included in the pilot program; and
                    (B) third-party collection processes used by 
                similar military medical treatment facilities not 
                included in the pilot program.

SEC. 712. SENSE OF SENATE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC 
              HEALTH RECORDS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE 
              DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The electronic health records systems used by the 
        Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        have been independently developed and implemented by each 
        Department. As a result, and despite more than 15 years of 
        efforts including numerous initiatives and programs, full 
        interoperability between the systems has yet to be achieved.
            (2) The lack of full interoperability between the health 
        records systems negatively impacts members of the Armed Forces 
        who separate from military service and transition to veteran 
        status. Medical records may be lost, requiring patients to 
        repeat tests, increase overall costs, and further exacerbate 
        the backlog of disability claims at the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs.
            (3) The Government Accountability Office has identified 
        several problems that the Department of Defense and the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs face in their efforts to achieve 
        full interoperability of their health records systems. The 
        Government Accountability Office points to the failure of the 
        Departments to define performance goals and measures that would 
        allow for program management and assessment of progress. The 
        Government Accountability Office also highlights inadequate 
        management in the Departments and the Interagency Program 
        Office, which oversees the integration of Department of Defense 
        and Department of Veterans Affairs medical records.
            (4) The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
        2008 directed the Department of Defense and the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs to jointly develop and implement fully 
        interoperable health record capabilities by September 30, 2009.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) despite clear congressional direction, years of effort, 
        and the expenditure of significant resources, full electronic 
        interoperability between the health records systems of the 
        Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        has not been achieved;
            (2) the Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with the 
        Secretary of Veterans Affairs, should fully staff the 
        Interagency Program Office and provide it with a robust charter 
        meeting the original intent of Congress;
            (3) the Secretary of Defense, in collaboration with the 
        Secretary of Veterans Affairs, should establish challenging, 
        but achievable, deadlines for the development and 
        implementation of measures and goals for electronic health 
        records for the Department of Defense and the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs, including measures and goals relating to--
                    (A) the creation of a health data authoritative 
                source;
                    (B) the ability of patients of both the Department 
                of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
                download their medical records (commonly referred to as 
                the ``Blue Button Initiative'');
                    (C) the full interoperability of personal health 
                care information between the Departments;
                    (D) the standardization of health care data between 
                the Departments;
                    (E) the acceleration of the exchange of real-time 
                health care data between the Departments;
                    (F) the upgrade of the graphical user interface to 
                display the new standardized health care data of the 
                Departments; and
                    (G) the provision to members of the Armed Forces of 
                access to an electronic copy of their health care 
                records throughout the course of their military career; 
                and
            (4) the Interagency Program Office should establish a 
        secure, remote, network-accessible computer storage system 
        (commonly referred to as ``cloud storage'') to--
                    (A) provide members of the Armed Forces and 
                veterans the ability to upload their health care 
                records; and
                    (B) allow medical providers of the Department of 
                Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to 
                access such records in the course of providing care to 
                members of the Armed Forces and veterans.

SEC. 721. REPORT ON PROVISION OF ADVANCED PROSTHETICS AND ORTHOTICS TO 
              MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND VETERANS.

    (a) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs shall jointly submit to the appropriate committees of 
Congress a report on the plans of the Department of Defense and the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, respectively, to ensure that the most 
clinically appropriate prosthetics and orthotics are made available to 
injured members of the Armed Forces and veterans using technological 
advances as appropriate.
    (b) Covered Prosthetics and Orthotics.--The prosthetics and 
orthotics to be covered by the report under subsection (a) shall 
include, but not be limited to, powered prosthetics and orthotics that 
will enable members of the Armed Forces and veterans who have suffered 
amputation and, in the case of orthotics wearers, other injuries with 
limb salvage, to restore functionality to the maximum extent 
practicable.
    (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--
            (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Veterans' Affairs of the Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on 
        Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives.

              AUTHORIZED BY LAW.

    (a) In General.--Subsection (i) of section 2306b of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
    ``(i) Defense Acquisitions Specifically Authorized by Law.--(1) In 
the case of the Department of Defense, a multiyear contract in amount 
equal to or greater than $500,000,000 may not be entered into under 
this section unless the contract is specifically authorized by law in 
an Act other than an appropriations Act.
    ``(2) In submitting a request for a specific authorization by law 
to carry out a defense acquisition program using multiyear contract 
authority under this section, the Secretary shall include in the 
request a report containing preliminary findings of the agency head 
required in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) together with 
the basis for such findings.
    ``(3) A multiyear contract may not be entered into under this 
section for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically 
authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority 
unless the Secretary of Defense certifies in writing, not later than 30 
days before entry into the contract, that each of the following 
conditions is satisfied:
            ``(A) The Secretary has determined that each of the 
        requirements in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) 
        will be met by such contract and has provided the basis for 
        such determination to the congressional defense committees.
            ``(B) The Secretary's determination under subparagraph (A) 
        was made after the completion of a cost analysis performed by 
        the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Analysis and such 
        analysis supports the findings.
            ``(C) The system being acquired pursuant to such contract 
        has not been determined to have experienced cost growth in 
        excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 
        section 2433(d) of this title within 5 years prior to the date 
        the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for 
        advance procurement entered into consistent with the 
        authorization for such contract) will be awarded.
            ``(D) A sufficient number of end items of the system being 
        acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within 
        the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost 
        or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that 
        current estimates of such unit costs are realistic.
            ``(E) During the fiscal year in which such contract is to 
        be awarded, sufficient funds will be available to perform the 
        contract in such fiscal year, and the future-years defense 
        program for such fiscal year will include the funding required 
        to execute the program without cancellation.
            ``(F) The contract is a fixed price type contract.
            ``(G) The proposed multiyear contract provides for 
        production at not less than minimum economic rates given the 
        existing tooling and facilities.
    ``(4) If for any fiscal year a multiyear contract to be entered 
into under this section is authorized by law for a particular 
procurement program and that authorization is subject to certain 
conditions established by law (including a condition as to cost savings 
to be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified 
other contracts) and if it appears (after negotiations with 
contractors) that such savings cannot be achieved, but that substantial 
savings could nevertheless be achieved through the use of a multiyear 
contract rather than specified other contracts, the President may 
submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified cost savings 
that must be achieved through multiyear contracting for that program. 
Any such request by the President shall include details about the 
request for a multiyear contract, including details about the 
negotiated contract terms and conditions.
    ``(5)(A) The Secretary may obligate funds for procurement of an end 
item under a multiyear contract for the purchase of property only for 
procurement of a complete and usable end item.
    ``(B) The Secretary may obligate funds appropriated for any fiscal 
year for advance procurement under a contract for the purchase of 
property only for the procurement of those long-lead items necessary in 
order to meet a planned delivery schedule for complete major end items 
that are programmed under the contract to be acquired with funds 
appropriated for a subsequent fiscal year (including an economic order 
quantity of such long-lead items when authorized by law).
    ``(6) The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph (3) 
notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the conditions of such 
certification are not met, if the Secretary determines that, due to 
exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear contract under 
this section is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and 
the Secretary provides the basis for such determination with the 
certification.
    ``(7) The Secretary may not delegate the authority to make the 
certification under paragraph (3) or the determination under paragraph 
(6) to an official below the level of Under Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subsection (a)(7) of such section is 
amended by striking ``subparagaphs (C) through (F) of paragraph (1) of 
subsection (i)'' and inserting ``subparagraphs (C) through (F) of 
subsection (i)(3)''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall take 
effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply with 
respect to requests for specific authorization by law to carry out 
defense acquisition programs using multiyear contract authority that 
are made on or after that date.

    (a) Comparative Analysis.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall, 
        acting through the Director of Cost Assessment and Program 
        Evaluation, submit to Congress a report setting forth a 
        comprehensive analysis comparing the cost, schedule, and 
        performance of personnel security clearance investigations and 
        reinvestigations for employees and contractor personnel of the 
        Department of Defense that are conducted by the Office of 
        Personnel Management with the cost, schedule, and performance 
        of personnel security clearance investigations and 
        reinvestigations for such personnel that are conducted by the 
        components of the Department of Defense.
            (2) Elements of analysis.--The analysis under paragraph (1) 
        shall do the following:
                    (A) Determine, for each of the Office of Personnel 
                Management and the components of the Department that 
                conduct personnel security investigations, the cost, 
                schedule, and performance associated with personnel 
                security investigations and reinvestigations of each 
                type and level of clearance, and identify the elements 
                that contribute to such cost, schedule, and 
                performance.
                    (B) Identify mechanisms for permanently improving 
                the transparency of the cost structure of personnel 
                security investigations and reinvestigations.
    (b) Personnel Security for Department of Defense Employees and 
Contractors.--
            (1) In general.--If the Secretary of Defense determines 
        that the current approach for obtaining personnel security 
        investigations and reinvestigations for employees and 
        contractor personnel of the Department of Defense is not the 
        most advantageous approach for the Department, the Secretary 
        shall develop a plan, by not later than October 1, 2014, for 
        the transition of personnel security investigations and 
        reinvestigations to the approach preferred by the Secretary.
            (2) Considerations.--In selecting the most advantageous 
        approach preferred for the Department under paragraph (1), the 
        Secretary shall consider whether cost, schedule, and 
        performance could be improved through increased reliance on 
        private-sector entities to conduct, or provide supporting 
        information for, personnel security investigations and 
        reinvestigations for employees and contractor personnel of the 
        Department.
    (c) Strategy for Continuous Modernization of Personnel Security.--
            (1) Strategy required.--The Secretary of Defense and the 
        Director of National Intelligence shall jointly develop and 
        implement a strategy to continuously modernize all aspects of 
        personnel security for the Department of Defense with the 
        objectives of lowering costs, increasing efficiencies, enabling 
        and encouraging reciprocity, and improving security.
            (2) Metrics.--
                    (A) Metrics required.--In developing the strategy 
                required by paragraph (1), the Secretary and the 
                Director shall jointly establish metrics to measure the 
                effectiveness of the strategy in meeting the objectives 
                specified in that paragraph.
                    (B) Report.--At the same time the budget of the 
                President for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2018 is 
                submitted to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 
                31, United States Code, the Secretary and the Director 
                shall jointly submit to the appropriate committees of 
                Congress a report on the metrics established under 
                paragraph (1), including an assessment using the 
                metrics of the effectiveness of the strategy in meeting 
                the objectives specified in paragraph (1).
            (3) Elements.--In developing the strategy required by 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary and the Director shall consider, 
        and may adopt, mechanisms for the following:
                    (A) Elimination of manual or inefficient processes 
                in investigations and reinvestigations for personnel 
                security, wherever practicable, and automating and 
                integrating the elements of the investigation process, 
                including in the following:
                            (i) The clearance application process.
                            (ii) Case management.
                            (iii) Adjudication management.
                            (iv) Investigation methods for the 
                        collection, analysis, storage, retrieval, and 
                        transfer of data and records.
                            (v) Records management for access and 
                        eligibility determinations.
                    (B) Elimination or reduction, where possible, of 
                the use of databases and information sources that 
                cannot be accessed and processed automatically 
                electronically, or modification of such databases and 
                information sources, if appropriate and cost-effective, 
                to enable electronic access and processing.
                    (C) Access and analysis of government, publically 
                available, and commercial data sources, including 
                social media, that provide independent information 
                pertinent to adjudication guidelines to improve quality 
                and timeliness, and reduce costs, of investigations and 
                reinvestigations.
                    (D) Use of government-developed and commercial 
                technology for continuous monitoring and evaluation of 
                government and commercial data sources that can 
                identify and flag information pertinent to adjudication 
                guidelines and eligibility determinations.
                    (E) Standardization of forms used for routine 
                reporting required of cleared personnel (such as 
                travel, foreign contacts, and financial disclosures) 
                and use of continuous monitoring technology to access 
                databases containing such reportable information to 
                independently obtain and analyze reportable data and 
                events.
                    (F) Establishment of an authoritative central 
                repository of personnel security information that is 
                accessible electronically at multiple levels of 
                classification and eliminates technical barriers to 
                rapid access to information necessary for eligibility 
                determinations and reciprocal recognition thereof.
                    (G) Elimination or reduction of the scope of, or 
                alteration of the schedule for, periodic 
                reinvestigations of cleared personnel, when such action 
                is appropriate in light of the information provided by 
                continuous monitoring or evaluation technology.
                    (H) Electronic integration of personnel security 
                processes and information systems with insider threat 
                detection and monitoring systems, and pertinent law 
                enforcement, counterintelligence and intelligence 
                information, for threat detection and correlation.
                    (I) Determination of the net value of implementing 
                phased investigative approaches designed to reach an 
                adjudicative decision sooner than is currently 
                achievable by truncating investigations based on 
                thresholds where no derogatory information or clearly 
                unacceptably derogatory information is obtained through 
                initial background checks.

            (1) By providing for reciprocity of personnel security 
        clearances among positions requiring personnel holding secret, 
        top secret, or sensitive compartmented information clearances 
        (the latter with a counterintelligence polygraph examination), 
        to the maximum extent feasible consistent with national 
        security requirements.
            (2) By permitting personnel, when feasible and consistent 
        with national security requirements, to begin work in positions 
        requiring additional security requirements, such as a full-
        scope polygraph examination, pending satisfaction of such 
        additional requirements.
