_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To de-link research and development incentives from drug prices for new 
    medicines to treat HIV/AIDS and to stimulate greater sharing of 
                         scientific knowledge.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
        estimates that more than 1,100,000 people are living with HIV 
        in the United States, and that 1 in 5 of those people living 
        with HIV is unaware of their infection.
            (2) An estimated 49,000 Americans become infected with HIV 
        each year.
            (3) More than 15,000 people with AIDS still die each year 
        in the United States.
            (4) Through 2010, more than 636,000 people with AIDS in the 
        United States have died since the epidemic began.
            (5) Globally, UNAIDS estimates that more than 34,000,000 
        persons are living with HIV.
            (6) Persons with HIV/AIDS require access to antiretroviral 
        drugs.
            (7) In the United States, public and private sector 
        expenditures on antiretroviral drugs currently exceed 
        $9,000,000,000 per year.
            (8) The United States Federal Government is the largest 
        funder of treatments for HIV/AIDS in the developing world.
            (9) The development of new medicines and vaccines for HIV/
        AIDS is a national priority.
            (10) Market exclusivity for new products is an expensive, 
        inefficient, and unfair mechanism to reward investments in new 
        products, and has created hardships for persons with HIV/AIDS 
        and businesses that employ persons with HIV/AIDS.
            (11) By de-linking research and development incentives from 
        product prices, and by eliminating legal monopolies to sell new 
        medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, it is possible to 
        induce investments that are medically more important, procure 
        products at low prices from competitive suppliers, and 
        introduce more efficient incentives for research and 
        development.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    It is the purpose of this Act to provide sustainable financing of 
incentives to encourage investments in research and development of new 
medicines for HIV/AIDS and to share knowledge, data, materials, and 
technology, through the establishment of a Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS, 
while enhancing access to such medicines by eliminating legal 
monopolies on the manufacture, distribution, and sale of such 
medicines.

        manufacturing process to the degree that the new qualifying 
        treatment or manufacturing process was based on or benefitted 
        from the development of the existing qualifying treatment or 
        manufacturing process.
            (2) The Prize Fund Director may award prize payments for a 
        qualifying treatment for HIV/AIDS or a manufacturing process 
        for a qualifying treatment for HIV/AIDS for not more than 10 
        fiscal years, regardless of the term of any related patents.
            (3) For any fiscal year, the Prize Fund Director may not 
        award a prize payment for any single qualifying treatment for 
        HIV/AIDS or manufacturing process for a qualifying treatment in 
        an amount that exceeds 50 percent of the total amount 
        appropriated to the Fund for that year.
            (4) For every qualifying treatment for HIV/AIDS that 
        receives market clearance, the Prize Fund Director shall 
        determine whether and in what amount to award a prize payment

shall consist of--
            (1) an amount set aside by the Secretary of Health and 
        Human Services that is equal to 10 percent of the amount of 
        money estimated by such Secretary as the cost of qualifying 
        treatments for HIV/AIDS used by programs supported by the 
        President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (commonly referred 
        to as ``PEPFAR'') or other federally supported programs to fund 
        the treatment of HIV/AIDS in developing countries; and
            (2) other amounts donated to the Fund as described in 
        subsection (d).
    (c) Use of Funds.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
(referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall use the funds 
from the Donor Innovation Prize Fund to reward the owners and 
developers of products that permit open competition for products in 
developing countries, either by not patenting products, providing 
nondiscriminatory royalty-free open licenses to all patents and other 
intellectual property claims on at least a field of use for the 
treatment of HIV/AIDS in developing countries, or through licenses to 
the Medicine Patent Pool.
    (d) Encouragement by Secretary.--The Secretary shall encourage 
other donors and developing country governments to contribute a similar 
fraction of drug purchase budgets to the Donor Innovation Prize Fund, 
in order to facilitate greater competition for generic drugs, while 
providing a sustainable source of rewards for innovation.
    (e) Prizes.--The Secretary shall establish and award prize payments 
from the Donor Innovation Prize Fund by applying similar eligibility 
rules, selection criteria, and requirements as are applied with respect 
to prize payments awarded from the Prize Fund for HIV/AIDS under 
section 8.
    (f) Transparency.--The Secretary shall adopt procedures to ensure 
that the operation of the Donor Innovation Prize Fund is transparent 
and supported by a description of the methods, data sources,
