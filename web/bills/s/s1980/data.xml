Medicaid and CHIP Continuous Quality Act of 2014 - Amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act (SSA) to require a state Medicaid plan to provide 12-month continuous enrollment for an eligible individual, regardless of age.

Amends SSA title XXI (State Children's Health Insurance) (CHIP) to: (1) require a state CHIP plan also to provide 12-month continuous enrollment for an eligible individual, (2) prohibit eligibility standards from applying a waiting period for a targeted low-income child (including a child provided dental-only supplemental coverage), and (3) remove the state option not to apply a waiting period in the case of a child provided dental-only supplemental coverage, and (4) extend the authorization of CHIP performance bonuses through FY2015.

Amends SSA title XIX to allow a state to qualify for performance bonuses for the enrollment and retention in Medicaid of certain low-income individuals.

Directs the Secretary to require states to use certain adult health quality measures and approaches to report on the initial core set of quality measures for Medicaid eligible adults and for the quality of pediatric health care.

Directs the Secretary to establish: (1) a Medicaid Quality Performance Bonus fund for awarding performance bonuses to select states for high attainment and improvement on a core set of quality measures related to the goals and purposes of the Medicaid program, as well as (2) a methodology for awarding Medicaid Quality Performance bonuses to states

Requires a state, as a condition of receiving a bonus fund award, to designate at least 75% of the performance bonus funds for the development and operation of quality-related initiatives that will directly benefit providers.</summary>
