        Services determines requires State legislation (other than 
        legislation appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet 
        the additional requirements imposed by section 108, the State 
        plan shall not be regarded as failing to comply with the 
        requirements of such part solely on the basis of the failure of 
        the plan to meet such additional requirements before the 1st 
        day of the 1st calendar quarter beginning after the close of 
        the 1st regular session of the State legislature that ends
