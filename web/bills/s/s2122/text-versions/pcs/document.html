                particularly small physician practices, in assuming 
                financial risk for the treatment of patients. Such 
                report shall examine barriers that small physician 
                practices currently face in assuming financial risk for 
                treating patients, the types of risk management

                such entities could assist with risk management and 
                with quality improvement activities. Such report shall

                to Congress a report that examines the transition of 
                professionals in rural areas, health professional 
                shortage areas (as designated in section 332(a)(1)(A)

                underserved areas to an alternative payment model (as 
                defined in section 1833(z)(3) of the Social Security 
                Act, as added by subsection (e)). Such report shall 
                make recommendations for removing administrative 
                barriers to practices, including small practices 
                consisting of 15 or fewer professionals, in rural 
                areas, health professional shortage areas, and 
                medically underserved areas to participation in such 
                models.

        fiscal years 2014 through 2018. Amounts transferred under this 
        paragraph shall be available until expended.

        shall include the feasibility of including a value-based 
        modifier and whether such modifier should be budget neutral.
            (7) Study and report on fraud related to alternative

                        under an alternative payment model (as defined 
                        in section 1833(z)(3)(C) of such Act (42 U.S.C.

                        alternative payment models, including under any 
                        potential expansion of such models.
                    (B) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date 
                of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall 
                submit to Congress a report containing the results of

                Inspector General for changes in Federal fraud 
                prevention laws to reduce such vulnerability.

                        as the ``Secretary'') shall conduct a study 
                        that examines the effect of individuals' 
                        socioeconomic status on quality and resource 
                        use outcome measures for individuals under the 
                        Medicare program (such as to recognize that 
                        less healthy individuals may require more 
                        intensive interventions). The study shall use 
                        information collected on such individuals in 
                        carrying out such program, such as urban and 
                        rural location, eligibility for Medicaid 
                        (recognizing and accounting for varying 
                        Medicaid eligibility across States), and 
                        eligibility for benefits under the supplemental 
                        security income (SSI) program. The Secretary 
                        shall carry out this paragraph acting through 
                        the Assistant Secretary for Planning and 
                        Evaluation.
                            (ii) Report.--Not later than 2 years after 
                        the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
                        Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on 
                        the study conducted under clause (i).
                    (B) Study using other data.--
                            (i) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a 
                        study that examines the impact of risk factors, 
                        such as those described in section 1848(p)(3) 
                        of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-
                        4(p)(3)), race, health literacy, limited 
                        English proficiency (LEP), and patient 
                        activation, on quality and resource use outcome 
                        measures under the Medicare program (such as to 
                        recognize that less healthy individuals may 
                        require more intensive interventions). In 
                        conducting such study the Secretary may use 
                        existing Federal data and collect such 
                        additional data as may be necessary to complete 
                        the study.
                            (ii) Report.--Not later than 5 years after 
                        the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
                        Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on 
                        the study conducted under clause (i).
                    (C) Examination of data in conducting studies.--In 
                conducting the studies under subparagraphs (A) and (B), 
                the Secretary shall examine what non-Medicare data 
                sets, such as data from the American Community Survey 
                (ACS), can be useful in conducting the types of studies 
                under such paragraphs and how such data sets that are 
                identified as useful can be coordinated with Medicare 
                administrative data in order to improve the overall 
                data set available to do such studies and for the 
                administration of the Medicare program.
                    (D) Recommendations to account for information in 
                payment adjustment mechanisms.--If the studies 
                conducted under subparagraphs (A) and (B) find a 
                relationship between the factors examined in the 
                studies and quality and resource use outcome measures, 
                then the Secretary shall also provide recommendations 
                for how the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
                should--
                            (i) obtain access to the necessary data (if 
                        such data is not already being collected) on 
                        such factors, including recommendations on how 
                        to address barriers to the Centers in accessing 
                        such data; and
                            (ii) account for such factors in 
                        determining payment adjustments based on 
                        quality and resource use outcome measures under 
                        the eligible professional Merit-based Incentive

                estimate how an individual's health status and other 
                risk factors affect quality and resource use outcome 
                measures and, as feasible, shall incorporate 
                information from quality and resource use outcome 
                measurement (including care episode and patient 
                condition groups) into provisions of title XVIII of the

                        shall, as the Secretary determines appropriate, 
                        account for identified factors with an effect 
                        on quality and resource use outcome measures 
                        when determining payment adjustment mechanisms 
                        under provisions of title XVIII of the Social 
                        Security Act that are similar to the eligible

                        been exchanged using common standards as to 
                        provide access to longitudinal information for 
                        health care providers in order to facilitate

        specialized MA plans for special needs individuals (as defined 
        in section 1859(b)(6) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-28(b)(6)),

                       TITLE IV--OTHER PROVISIONS

SEC. 401. COMMISSION ON IMPROVING PATIENT DIRECTED HEALTH CARE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In order to elevate the role of patient choices in the 
        health care system, the American public must engage in an 
        informed, national, public debate on how the current health 
        care system empowers and informs health care decision-making, 
        and what can be done to improve the likelihood patients receive 
        the care they want and need.
            (2) Research suggests that patients often do not receive 
        the care they want. As a result, the end of life is associated 
        with a substantial burden of suffering by the patient and 
        negative health and financial consequences that extend to 
        family members and society.
            (3) Patients face a complex and fragmented health care 
        system that may decrease the likelihood that health care 
        choices are known and carried out. The health care system 
        should embed principles that take into account patient wishes.
            (4) Decisions concerning health care, including end-of-life 
        issues, affect an increasing number of Americans.
            (5) Medical advances are prolonging life expectancy in the 
        United States both in acute life-threatening situations and 
        protracted battles with illness. These advances raise new 
        challenges surrounding health care decision-making.
            (6) The United States health care system should promote 
        consideration of a person's preference in health care decision-
        making and end-of-life choices.
    (b) Commission.--The Social Security Act is amended by inserting 
after section 1150B (42 U.S.C. 1320b-24) the following new section:
