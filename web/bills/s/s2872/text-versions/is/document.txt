    (a) Definitions.--In this section--
            (1) the term ``National Instant Criminal Background Check 
        System'' means the National Instant Criminal Background Check 
        System established under section 103 of the Brady Handgun 
        Violence Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. 922 note); and
            (2) the terms ``firearm'' and ``licensed dealer'' have the 
        meanings given those terms in section 921(a) of title 18, 
        United States Code.
    (b) Establishment of Notification System.--The Attorney General 
shall establish a system for the prompt notification of the relevant 
State and local enforcement agencies when the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System notifies a licensed dealer that the information 
available to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System 
indicates that the possession of a firearm by an individual attempting 
to obtain a firearm from the licensed dealer would violate subsection 
(g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code, or State 
law, except when the Attorney General determines, on a case-by-case 
basis, that law enforcement purposes would best be served by not 
providing such a notice.
