        the applicable report under section 3(b)(2). If a committee 
        fails to report the joint resolution within that period, the 
        committee shall be discharged from further consideration of the 
        joint resolution and the joint resolution shall be referred to 
        the appropriate calendar.
            (3) Proceeding to consideration.--After each committee 
        authorized to consider a joint resolution reports it to the 
        House of Representatives or has been discharged from its 
        consideration, it shall be in order, not later than the day 
        before the date on which the amendments under section 2(c) 
        relating to the applicable professional sport take effect, to 
        move to proceed to consider the joint resolution in the House 
        of Representatives. All points of order against the motion are 
        waived. During the 95-day period described in subsection 
        (a)(2)(A) relating to a joint resolution relating to a 
        professional sport, such a motion shall not be in order after 
        the House of Representatives has disposed of a motion to 
        proceed on the joint resolution. The previous question shall be 
        considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without 
        intervening motion. The motion shall not be debatable. A motion 
        to reconsider the vote by which the motion is disposed of shall 
        not be in order.
            (4) Floor consideration.--
                    (A) In general.--The joint resolution shall be 
                considered as read. All points of order against the 
                joint resolution and against its consideration are 
                waived.
                    (B) Consideration.--The previous question shall be 
                considered as ordered on the joint resolution to its 
                passage without intervening motion except 4 hours of 
                debate equally divided and controlled by the proponent 
                and an opponent. A motion to reconsider the vote on 
                passage of the joint resolution shall not be in order.
    (c) Expedited Procedure in Senate.--
            (1) Introduction.--
                    (A) In general.--Not later than the end of the 
                second day of continuous session of the Senate after 
                the date on which the Commission submits a report under 
                section 3(b)(2), the Majority Leader of the Senate 
                shall introduce a joint resolution relating to each 
                professional sport for which an amendment under section 
                2(b) has not taken effect.
                    (B) Other members.--If the Majority Leader of the 
                Senate does not introduce a joint resolution under 
                subparagraph (A) relating to a professional sport for 
                which an amendment under section 2(b) has not taken 
                effect, during the period beginning on the third day of 
                continuous session of the Senate after the date on 
                which the Commission submits a report under section 
                3(b)(2) and ending on the day before the date on which 
                the amendments under section 2(c) relating to the 
                applicable professional sport take effect, it shall be 
                in order for any Member of the Senate to introduce a 
                joint resolution relating to the applicable 
                professional sport.
                    (C) Single joint resolution for a professional 
                sport.--If a joint resolution relating to a 
                professional sport is introduced in the Senate, it 
                shall not be in order to introduce a joint resolution 
                relating to that professional sport in the Senate until 
                after the date on which the Commission submits the next 
                report required under section 3(b)(2).
            (2) Reporting and discharge.--Any committee of the Senate 
        to which a joint resolution is referred shall report it to the 
        Senate without amendment not later than 35 calendar days after 
        the date on which the Commission submits the applicable report 
        under section 3(b)(2). If a committee fails to report the joint 
        resolution within that period, the committee shall be 
        discharged from further consideration of the joint resolution 
        and the joint resolution shall be placed on the Calendar of 
        Business.
            (3) Floor consideration.--
                    (A) In general.--Notwithstanding rule XXII of the 
                Standing Rules of the Senate, after each committee 
                authorized to consider a joint resolution reports it to 
                the Senate or has been discharged from its 
                consideration, it is in order, not later than the day 
                before the date on which the amendments under section 
                2(c) relating to the applicable professional sport take 
                effect, (even though a previous motion to the same 
                effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the 
                consideration of the joint resolution, and all points 
                of order against the joint resolution (and against 
                consideration of the joint resolution) are waived. The 
                motion to proceed is not debatable. The motion is not 
                subject to a motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider 
                the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed 
                to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the 
                consideration of the joint resolution is agreed to, the 
                joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business 
                until disposed of.
                    (B) Consideration.--Debate on a joint resolution, 
                and on all debatable motions and appeals in connection 
                therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, 
                which shall be divided equally between the majority and 
                minority leaders or their designees. A motion further 
                to limit debate is in order and not debatable. An 
                amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of other business, or a 
                motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in 
                order.
                    (C) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage of a 
                joint resolution shall occur immediately following the 
                conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution, and a 
                single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if 
                requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate.
                    (D) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals 
                from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
                application of the rules of the Senate, as the case may 
                be, to the procedure relating to a joint resolution 
                shall be decided without debate.
    (d) Rules Relating to Senate and House of Representatives.--
            (1) Coordination with action by other house.--If, before 
        the passage by one House of a joint resolution of that House 
        relating to a professional sport, that House receives from the 
        other House a joint resolution relating to the same 
        professional sport--
                    (A) the joint resolution of the other House shall 
                not be referred to a committee; and
                    (B) with respect to a joint resolution of the House 
                receiving the resolution relating to the same 
                professional sport--
                            (i) the procedure in that House shall be 
                        the same as if no joint resolution had been 
                        received from the other House; but
                            (ii) the vote on passage shall be on the 
                        joint resolution of the other House relating to 
                        the same professional sport.
            (2) Treatment of joint resolution of other house.--If one 
        House fails to introduce or consider a joint resolution 
        relating to a professional sport under this section, the joint 
        resolution of the other House relating to the same professional 
        sport shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under 
        this section.
            (3) Treatment of companion measures.--If, following passage 
        of a joint resolution relating to a professional sport in the 
        Senate, the Senate then receives the companion measure from the 
        House of Representatives relating to the same professional 
        sport, the companion measure shall not be debatable.
    (e) Vetoes.--If the President vetoes a joint resolution, debate on 
a veto message in the Senate under this section shall be 1 hour equally 
divided between the majority and minority leaders or their designees.
    (f) Time Limitation.--It shall not be in order to consider a joint 
resolution under this section on or after the date on which the 
amendments relating to the professional sport to which the joint 
resolution relates take effect under section 2(c).
    (g) Rules of House of Representatives and Senate.--This section is 
enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is 
        deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but 
        applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in 
        that House in the case of a joint resolution, and it supersedes 
        other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent with 
        such rules; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the 
        procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and 
        to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
        House.
