(This converts the Pell Grant program into a mandatory spending program.)\n\nDirects the Secretary of Education to award an additional Pell Grant to an eligible student who: (1) has received a Pell Grant for an award year, and (2) is enrolled in a program of study for one or more additional payment periods during the same award year that are not otherwise covered by the Pell Grant.\n\nPermits the total amount of the Pell Grants awarded to such student for the award year to exceed the total maximum Pell Grant for such award year."
