National Forest Jobs and Management Act of 2014 - Authorizes USDA to conduct projects that involve the management or sale of national forest material within certain National Forest System (NFS) lands.\n\nAmends the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to authorize the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to obligate funds to cover any potential cancellation or termination for an agreement or contract under such Act in stages that are economically and programmatically viable.\n\nRequires the Forest Service and BLM to notify Congress before entering into a multiyear agreement or contract that includes a cancellation ceiling in excess of $25 million, but does not include proposed funding for the costs of cancelling up to the ceiling."
