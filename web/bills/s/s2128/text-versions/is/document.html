SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On October 12, 1919, Doris Miller was born in Waco, 
        Texas.
            (2) On September 16, 1939, Miller enlisted in the United 
        States Navy as mess attendant, third class at Naval Recruiting 
        Station, Dallas, Texas, to serve for a period of six years.
            (3) On February 16, 1941, Miller received a change of 
        rating to mess attendant, second class.
            (4) On June 1, 1942, Miller received a change of rating to 
        mess attendant, first class.
            (5) On June 1, 1943, Miller received a change of rating, to 
        cook, third class.
            (6) On November 25, 1944, Miller was presumed dead by the 
        Secretary of the Navy a year and a day after being carried as 
        missing in action since November 24, 1943, while serving aboard 
        USS Liscome Bay when that vessel was torpedoed and sunk in the 
        Pacific Ocean.
            (7) Miller was awarded the Navy Cross Medal, Purple Heart 
        Medal, American Defense Service Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign 
        Medal, and World War II Victory Medal.
            (8) Miller's citation for the Navy Cross said ``for 
        distinguished devotion to duty, extraordinary courage and 
        disregard for his own personal safety during the attack on the 
        Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, by Japanese forces 
        on December 7, 1941. While at the side of his Captain on the 
        bridge, Miller, despite enemy strafing and bombing and in the 
        face of a serious fire, assisted in moving his Captain, who had 
        been mortally wounded, to a place of greater safety, and later 
        manned and operated a machine gun directed at enemy Japanese 
        attacking aircraft until ordered to leave the bridge.''.
            (9) On June 20, 1973, the USS Miller (FF-1091), a Knox-
        class frigate, was named in honor of Doris Miller.
