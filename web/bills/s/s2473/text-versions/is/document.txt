SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States is the global leader in wireless 
        communications and broadband technologies, both of which are 
        vital parts of daily life in the United States, key components 
        of the national infrastructure of the United States, and a 
        significant driver of the United States economy.
            (2) Wireless communications and broadband services have 
        become critical for individuals to improve their economic well-
        being, businesses to compete in the 21st century, first 
        responders to protect individuals in emergencies, and Federal 
        agencies to service their missions, such as national defense.
            (3) Because of the proliferation of broadband connected 
        wireless devices and consumer applications, the volume of data 
        traffic traveling over wireless networks has been growing 
        substantially, and with the pace of innovation accelerating, 
        the demand for wireless data services will continue to increase 
        exponentially.
            (4) The Council of Economic Advisors has concluded that the 
        only feasible way to realize the full potential of wireless 
        broadband is to make new spectrum available for wireless 
        services, and considerable spectrum is underused or used in 
        less economically valuable ways, and could be repurposed and 
        reallocated for wireless broadband use.
            (5) If the United States does not make more spectrum 
        available, scarcity of spectrum could lead to higher prices for 
        wireless services, poor service quality, the inability of the 
        United States to compete internationally, constrained mobile 
        broadband growth, and ultimately, a drag on innovation and 
        individual economic mobility.
            (6) The National Broadband Plan, created by the Federal 
        Communications Commission, set a goal of making 500 megahertz 
        of spectrum newly available for commercial mobile broadband use 
        by 2020, including making 300 megahertz between 225 megahertz 
        and 3.7 gigahertz newly available for mobile use within 5 
        years, and stated that reallocating this spectrum where 
        possible for mobile broadband use should be a priority.
            (7) Reallocating and auctioning spectrum produces multiple 
        benefits. A Federal licensee can upgrade to comparable or 
        superior communications technology, an auction raises money for 
        the United States Treasury, and taxpayers benefit from 
        increased access to, and better use of, spectrum.
            (8) In addition to reallocating spectrum, the United States 
        should pursue a comprehensive approach to spectrum policy that 
        includes expanding the capacity of wireless networks, promoting 
        secondary spectrum markets, expanding unlicensed networks and 
        Wi-Fi systems, and increasing efficiency and transparency among 
        Federal users.
            (9) The Federal Government, as the largest user of 
        spectrum, must also promote the efficient use of spectrum 
        resources, and the National Telecommunications and Information 
        Administration must ensure that Federal agencies use this 
        valuable public resource in the most efficient and effective 
        manner possible.
            (10) The National Broadband Plan states that Federal 
        spectrum users can be more efficient with the airwaves 
        allocated to them by the National Telecommunications and 
        Information Administration, especially as wireless needs and 
        technology evolve over time.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is--
            (1) to pursue comprehensive solutions to expand mobile 
        broadband and utilize wireless services and technologies to 
        create jobs, grow the economy, and improve individual economic 
        mobility; and
            (2) to ensure that the Federal Government--
                    (A) utilizes its spectrum in the most efficient and 
                effective way; and
                    (B) repurposes spectrum for commercial use wherever 
                possible.

                facilitate the design and procurement of Federal 
                spectrum-dependent systems that increase flexibility 
                through means such as multiple-band tuning capabilities 
                and the use of commercial systems as appropriate, 
                including through public-private partnerships.
            (2) Conditions.--
                    (A) Use of payment to estimate costs.--A Federal 
                entity that receives a payment under subparagraph (A)

                923(g)(3)(A)) with respect to frequencies identified by 
                the Federal entity for potential reallocation.
                    (B) Relocation or sharing costs.--The Director may 
                not make a payment under paragraph (1) if the amount 
                made available under subsection (b) is otherwise 
                necessary to cover relocation or sharing costs (as 
                defined in section 113(g)(3)) of the National 
                Telecommunications and Information Administration

                receives a payment under paragraph (1) shall, to the 
                extent possible, procure systems described in 
                subparagraph (B) of that paragraph such that emission 
                levels resulting from reasonable use of adjacent 
                spectrum will not impair the functioning of the 
                systems, consistent with any applicable radio receiver 
                performance criteria and international obligations.
            (3) Annual report.--Each year, the Director shall submit to

SEC. 9. FEDERAL SPECTRUM TRANSPARENCY AND VALUE.

    (a) Analysis of Economic Opportunity Cost.--
            (1) Development of framework.--Not later than 1 year after 
        the date of enactment of this Act, the NTIA, in consultation 
        with the Commission and the Director of the Office of 
        Management and Budget, shall develop a framework for 
        determining the annual economic opportunity cost of each 
        specific Federal spectrum band assigned or otherwise allocated 
        for use by Federal entities.
            (2) Scope.--The framework developed under paragraph (1) 
        shall cover all federally allocated spectrum bands between 150 
        megahertz and 6000 megahertz, inclusive.
            (3) Goals.--The goals of the framework developed under 
        paragraph (1) are--
                    (A) to provide Federal entities with a sustained 
                long-term signal of spectrum value to inform the 
                spectrum management decisions of such entities; and
                    (B) to provide the public with increased 
                transparency about how Federal entities use a scarce 
                physical resource.
            (4) Requirements.--The framework developed under paragraph 
        (1) shall--
                    (A) define the term ``opportunity cost'' as the 
                value of the spectrum, in dollar terms, as if such 
                spectrum were to be reallocated on a licensed basis to 
                the highest commercial alternative use that currently 
                does not have access to that spectrum;
                    (B) be updated, on an annual basis, to take into 
                account observed market valuations from spectrum 
                auctions, secondary spectrum trading, and other market 
                indicators of spectrum value;
                    (C) determine the opportunity costs borne by each 
                Federal entity for each spectrum band that is entirely 
                under the control of a single agency; and
                    (D) determine the opportunity costs for spectrum 
                assigned or otherwise allocated to Federal entities for 
                both primary use and secondary use.
    (b) Report on Opportunity Costs.--Each Federal entity that has been 
assigned or otherwise allocated use of a Federal spectrum band shall 
report, as an off-budget item, the opportunity cost borne by the entity 
for each spectrum band the entity uses--
            (1) in the budget of the entity to be included in the 
        budget of the United States Government submitted by the 
        President under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code; 
        and
            (2) in the annual financial statement of the Federal entity 
        required to be filed under section 3515 of title 31, United 
        States Code.
    (c) Spectrum Value Analysis.--Not later than 5 years after the date 
of enactment of this Act, and every 5 years thereafter, each Federal 
entity that has been assigned or otherwise allocated use of a Federal 
spectrum band, or otherwise utilizes such spectrum, shall engage in an 
analysis comparing the opportunity cost of that spectrum, as such cost 
is determined by the framework developed by the NTIA under subsection 
(a), to the projected costs of the entity relocating to other 
government spectrum holdings, co-locating with other government 
agencies, leasing other non-Federal spectrum, or contracting out for 
its spectrum activities.
    (d) Spectrum Technology Study.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, and every 5 years thereafter, the Chief 
        Technology Officer, in consultation with the Assistant 
        Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information and 
        the Comptroller General of the United States, shall examine the 
        technologies and equipment used by Federal entities operating 
        on Federal spectrum allocations and determine if such 
        technologies and equipment are the most spectrum-efficient 
        available.
            (2) Certain determinations made.--If the results of any 
        study required under paragraph (1) determine that the 
        technologies and equipment of Federal entities operating on 
        Federal spectrum allocations are not the most spectrum-
        efficient available, the Comptroller General shall determine--
                    (A) what the costs would be to upgrade such systems 
                to more up-to-date and readily available systems;
                    (B) what benefits would be gained from upgrading, 
                particularly any cost savings or increases in spectrum 
                utilization efficiency; and
                    (C) if there are any possible problems with 
                upgrading to more up-to-date systems.
    (e) Spectrum Opportunity Cost and Framework Study.--
            (1) In general.--The Comptroller General of the United 
        States, in consultation with the NTIA, shall--
                    (A) conduct a review of the framework developed 
                under subsection (a);
                    (B) conduct a review of the reports required under 
                subsection (b) and the processes that Federal entities 
                use to evaluate the opportunity cost borne for each 
                spectrum band the Federal entities use; and
                    (C) make recommendations on how to improve such 
                framework and reporting.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, and every 2 years thereafter, the 
        Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the 
        appropriate committees in Congress a report on the review and 
        recommendations required under paragraph (1).
                                 <all>
