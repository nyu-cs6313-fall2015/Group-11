                                 A BILL


 
    To direct the Secretary of Commerce to issue a fishing capacity 
reduction loan to refinance the existing loan funding the Pacific Coast 
             groundfish fishing capacity reduction program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    This Act may be cited as the ``Revitalizing the Economy of 
Fisheries in the Pacific Act'' or the ``REFI Pacific Act''.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.</DELETED>

<DELETED>    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) In 2000, the Secretary of Commerce declared 
        the West Coast groundfish fishery a Federal fisheries economic 
        disaster due to low stock abundance, an overcapitalized fleet, 
        and historically overfished stocks.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) Section 212 of the Department of Commerce and 
        Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003 (title II of division 
        B of Public Law 108-7; 117 Stat. 80) was enacted to establish a 
        Pacific Coast groundfish fishing capacity reduction program, 
        also known as a buyback program, to remove excess fishing 
        capacity.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (3) In 2003, Congress authorized the $35,700,000 
        buyback loan, creating the Pacific Coast groundfish fishing 
        capacity reduction program through the National Marine 
        Fisheries Service fisheries finance program with a term of 30 
        years. The interest rate of the buyback loan was fixed at 6.97 
        percent and is paid back based on an ex-vessel fee landing rate 
        not to exceed 5 percent for the loan.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (4) The groundfish fishing capacity reduction 
        program resulted in the removal of limited entry trawl Federal 
        fishing permits from the fishery, representing approximately 46 
        percent of total landings at the time.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (5) Because of an absence of a repayment 
        mechanism, $4,243,730 in interest accrued before fee collection 
        procedures were established in 2005, over 18 months after the 
        groundfish fishing capacity reduction program was 
        initiated.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (6) In 2011, the West Coast groundfish fishery 
        transitioned to an individual fishing quota fishery, which is a 
        type of catch share program.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (7) By 2015, West Coast groundfish fishermen's 
        expenses are expected to include fees of approximately $450 per 
        day for observers, a 3-percent cost recovery fee as authorized 
        by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act 
        (16 U.S.C. 1801) for catch share programs, and a 5-percent ex-
        vessel landings rate for the loan repayment, which could reach 
        18 percent of their total gross revenue.</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (8) In 2012, the West Coast groundfish limited 
        entry trawl fishery generated $63,000,000, an increase from an 
        average of $45,000,000 during the years 2006 to 2011. This 
        revenue is expected to continue to increase post-
        rationalization.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to refinance the 
Pacific Coast groundfish fishery fishing capacity reduction program to 
protect and conserve the West Coast groundfish fishery and the coastal 
economies in California, Oregon, and Washington that rely on 
it.</DELETED>

<DELETED>SEC. 3. REFINANCING OF PACIFIC COAST GROUNDFISH FISHING 
              CAPACITY REDUCTION LOAN.</DELETED>
