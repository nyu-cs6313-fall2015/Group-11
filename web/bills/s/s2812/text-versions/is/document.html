                payment for all such loans equal to the income-driven 
                calculation, divided by 12.
                    ``(B) The holder of such a loan shall apply the 
                borrower's monthly payment under this subsection first 
                toward interest due on the loan, next toward any fees 
                due on the loan, and then toward the principal of the

        paragraph (1), any monthly payments made during the period the 
        borrower is in violation of the requirement of paragraph (1)
