SEC. 302. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.

    (a) Fugitive Methane Emissions.--Not later than 2 years after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency shall submit to Congress a report describing the 
quantity of fugitive methane emissions emitted as a result of any leak 
in natural gas infrastructure, including recommendations for 
eliminating each such leak.
    (b) Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions.--The Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency shall enter into an agreement with the 
National Academy of Sciences under which the Academy shall conduct a 
study, and, not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this 
Act, submit to Congress a report describing--
            (1) the quantity of United States greenhouse gas emissions 
        not covered by a program under this Act (or an amendment made 
        by this Act); and
            (2) recommendations for programs to reduce emissions of 
        those greenhouse gases.

SEC. 303. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS 
              EMISSIONS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the United States should carry out 
activities to ensure that, by January 1, 2050, the total quantity of 
greenhouse gas emissions released in the United States is reduced by 
not less than 80 percent, as compared to the total quantity of 
greenhouse gas emissions released during calendar year 2005.
