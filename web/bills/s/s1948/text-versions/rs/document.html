                                 A BILL


 
To promote the academic achievement of American Indian, Alaska Native, 
    and Native Hawaiian children with the establishment of a Native 
                    American language grant program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Native Language Immersion 
Student Achievement Act''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Congress established the unique status of 
        Native American languages and distinctive policies supporting 
        their use as a medium of education in the Native American 
        Languages Act (Public Law 101-477).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Reports from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and 
        tribal, public, charter, and private schools and colleges that 
        use primarily Native American languages to deliver education, 
        have indicated that students from these schools have generally 
        had high school graduation and college attendance rates above 
        the norm for their peers.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
        1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) includes policy barriers to 
        schools taught through Native American languages and a lack of 
        adequate funding to support such opportunities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) There is a critical need that requires 
        immediate action to support education through Native American 
        languages to preserve these languages.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE SCHOOLS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Native Language Immersion Student 
Achievement Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress established the unique status of Native 
        American languages and distinctive policies supporting their 
        use as a medium of education in the Native American Languages 
        Act (Public Law 101-477).
            (2) Reports from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal, 
        public, charter, and private schools and colleges that use 
        primarily Native American languages to deliver education, have 
        indicated that students from these schools have generally had 
        high school graduation and college attendance rates above the 
        norm for their peers.
            (3) Such successful schools include Native American 
        language medium schools focusing primarily on children who 
        enter school speaking Native American languages and immersion 
        schools that focus primarily on teaching Native American 
        languages to children who enter school with little or no 
        knowledge of a Native American language, as well as programs 
        combining features of both types of schools, such as Native 
        American Language Nests and Native American Language Survival 
        Schools.
            (4) The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 
        U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) includes policy barriers to schools taught 
        through Native American languages and a lack of adequate 
        funding to support such opportunities.
            (5) There is a critical need that requires immediate action 
        to support education through Native American languages to 
        preserve these languages.

SEC. 3. NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE SCHOOLS.

    Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:
