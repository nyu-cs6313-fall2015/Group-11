                section 1848 of a care management fee to the medical 
                home and may include performance incentives. The

                of a medical home based on the payment methodology 
                applied to health group practices under section 1866A. 
                Under such methodology, 80 percent of the reductions in

                The amount of such reductions in expenditures shall be 
                determined by using assumptions with respect to 
                reductions in the occurrence of health complications, 
                hospitalization rates, medical errors, and adverse drug 
                reactions.

                purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall compute 
                an estimated annual spending target based on the amount 
                the Secretary estimates would have been spent in the 
                absence of this section, for items and services covered 
                under parts A and B furnished to applicable 
                beneficiaries for each qualifying medical home under 
                this section. Such spending targets shall be determined 
                on a per capita basis. Such spending targets shall 
                include a risk corridor that takes into account normal 
                variation in expenditures for items and services 
                covered under parts A and B furnished to such 
                beneficiaries with the size of the corridor being 
                related to the number of applicable beneficiaries 
                furnished services by each medical home. The spending 
                targets may also be adjusted for such other factors as 
                the Secretary determines appropriate.
                    ``(C) Incentive payments.--Subject to performance 
                on quality measures, a qualifying medical home is 
                eligible to receive an incentive payment under this 
                section if actual expenditures for a year for the 
                applicable beneficiaries it enrolls are less than the 
                estimated spending target established under 
                subparagraph (B) for such year. An incentive payment 
                for such year shall be equal to a portion (as 
                determined by the Secretary) of the amount by which 
                actual expenditures (including incentive payments under 
                this paragraph) for applicable beneficiaries under 
                parts A and B for such year are estimated to be less 
                than 95 percent of the estimated spending target for 
                such year, as determined under subparagraph (B).
            ``(3) Source.--Payments paid under this section shall be 
        made in appropriate proportions (as specified by the Secretary) 
        from the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal 
        Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, and funds 
        appropriated to carry out title XIX.
    ``(f) Evidence-Based.--The contracting entity shall follow 
evidence-based guidelines for care of the long-term illness or medical 
condition under this section.
    ``(g) Patient Services Quality and Performance Reporting.--The 
contracting entity shall report at least by the end of every month data 
specified by the Secretary on the operation of this section, including 
quality measures of process, outcome, and structure.
    ``(h) Waiver Authority.--
            ``(1) In general.--The limitations on telehealth under 
        section 1834(m) shall not apply for purposes of this section.
            ``(2) Secretary authority.--The Secretary may waive such 
        other requirements of this title and title XIX as may be 
        necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.''.

        any other provision of this section, an ACO may include 
        coverage of telehealth and remote patient monitoring services

        Medicare Advantage plan is permitted to provide coverage of 
        such services as supplemental health care benefits under 
        section 1852(a)(3)(A).

        based video conferencing services in connection with the 
        provision of home health services (under conditions for which 
        payment for such services would not be made under section 1895 
        for such services) in a manner that is financially equivalent
