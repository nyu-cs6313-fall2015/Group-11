     TITLE I--FAIR ELECTIONS FINANCING OF SENATE ELECTION CAMPAIGNS

              Subtitle A--Fair Elections Financing Program

SEC. 101. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.

    (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From Private 
Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the current system of 
privately financed campaigns for election to the United States Senate 
has the capacity, and is often perceived by the public, to undermine 
democracy in the United States by--
            (1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived 
        conflicts of interest by encouraging Senators to accept large 
        campaign contributions from private interests that are directly 
        affected by Federal legislation;
            (2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Senators' 
        accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to be 
        accountable to the major contributors who finance their 
        election campaigns;
            (3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by 
        allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and unfair 
        influence within the political process;
            (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through 
        legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal access 
        to lawmakers for campaign contributors;
            (5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to 
        mount competitive Senate election campaigns;
            (6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive 
        elections; and
            (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with 
        fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry out 
        their public responsibilities.
    (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From the Fair 
Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and declares that providing the 
option of the replacement of large private campaign contributions with 
allocations from the Fair Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and 
general elections to the Senate would enhance American democracy by--
            (1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest 
        created by fully private financing of the election campaigns of 
        public officials and restoring public confidence in the 
        integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative 
        processes through a program which allows participating 
        candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution limits 
        for contributors with an assurance that there will be 
        sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral 
        campaigns;
            (2) increasing the public's confidence in the 
        accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect them, 
        which derives from the program's qualifying criteria to 
        participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that 
        constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and 
        participate in the program;
            (3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign 
        contributions as a determinant of a citizen's influence within 
        the political process by facilitating the expression of support 
        by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging political 
        participation, and incentivizing participation on the part of 
        Senators through the matching of small dollar contributions;
            (4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that 
        may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated based 
        upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the influence 
        of campaign contributions;
            (5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run 
        for the Senate and encouraging more competitive elections;
            (6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by 
        citizens of every level of wealth; and
            (7) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with 
        raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their 
        public responsibilities.
