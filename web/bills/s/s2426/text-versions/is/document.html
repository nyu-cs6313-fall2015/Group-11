  the Bureau of Prisons ensure that each chief executive officer of a 
  Federal penal or correctional institution provides a secure storage 
 area located outside of the secure perimeter of the Federal penal or

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 (Public 
        Law 108-277; 118 Stat. 865) gives certain law enforcement 
        officers, including certain correctional officers of the Bureau 
        of Prisons, the right to carry a concealed firearm in all 50 
        States for self-protection;
            (2) the purpose of that Act is to allow certain law 
        enforcement officers to protect themselves while off duty;
            (3) correctional officers of the Bureau of Prisons have 
        been the targets of assaults and murders while off duty; and
            (4) while that Act allows certain law enforcement officers 
        to protect themselves off duty, the Director of the Bureau of 
        Prisons allows correctional officers of the Bureau of Prisons 
        to securely store personal firearms at only 33 Federal penal 
        and correctional institutions while at work.
