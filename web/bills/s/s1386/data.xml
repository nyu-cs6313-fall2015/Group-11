Title II: Contracting and Other Matters - (Sec. 201) Revises requirements for local guard contracts abroad.

(Sec. 202) Amends the Diplomatic Security Act to declare that unsatisfactory leadership by a senior official regarding a security incident involving loss of life, serious injury, or significant destruction of property at or related to a U.S. government mission abroad may be grounds for disciplinary action.

(Sec. 203) Declares that nothing in this Act or any other provision of law shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from taking personnel action against any Department employee or official who has breached his or her duty or has engaged in misconduct or unsatisfactorily performed such duties in a manner that has significantly contributed to the serious injury, loss of life, or significant destruction of property, or a serious breach of security.

(Sec. 204) Amends the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to authorize the Secretary to provide physical security enhancements at overseas educational facilities established for the children of U.S. government employees.

Title V: Accountability Review Boards - (Sec. 501) Expresses the sense of Congress that the Accountability Review Board mechanism: (1) is an effective tool to collect information about and evaluate adverse incidents affecting U.S. diplomatic personnel; and (2) should assist the Secretary, the President, and Congress in determining what contributed to an adverse incident as well as what new measures are necessary to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.

(Sec. 502) Requires the Secretary to give Congress copies of any Board reports.

(Sec. 503) Amends the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act to revise Board membership and staff requirements.
