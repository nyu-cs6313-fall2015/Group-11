                                 A BILL


 
 To ensure that oil transported through the Keystone XL pipeline into 
the United States is used to reduce United States dependence on Middle 
                              Eastern oil.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ENERGY SECURITY.

    (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the Secretary of Energy 
shall ensure that any crude oil and bitumen transported into the United 
States by the Keystone XL pipeline, and all refined petroleum fuel 
products originating from that crude oil or bitumen, will be entered 
into domestic commerce in the United States for--
            (1) use as a fuel; or
            (2) the manufacture of another product.
    (b) Waivers Authorized.--The President may waive the requirement 
described in subsection (a) if--
            (1) the President determines that a waiver is in the 
        national interest because it--
                    (A) will not lead to an increase in domestic 
                consumption of crude oil or refined petroleum products 
                obtained from countries hostile to United States 
                interests or with political and economic instability 
                that compromises energy supply security;
                    (B) will not lead to higher costs to refiners who 
                purchase the crude oil than the refiners would pay for 
                crude oil in the absence of the waiver; and
                    (C) will not lead to higher gasoline costs to 
                consumers than consumers would pay in the absence of 
                the waiver;
            (2) an exchange of crude oil or refined product provides 
        for no net loss of crude oil or refined product consumed 
        domestically; or
            (3) a waiver is necessary under the Constitution, a law, or 
        an international agreement.
                                 <all>
