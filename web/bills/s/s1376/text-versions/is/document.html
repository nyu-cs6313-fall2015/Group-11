            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) Evaluation of up-front and annual premiums.--
                    ``(A) Annual review.--The Secretary shall, at least 
                annually, review--
                            ``(i) the amount of the annual and up-front 
                        premiums collected under this subsection; and

                obligation of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund after 
                the date that such review is complete, adjust the 
                annual and up-front premiums applied to such mortgages 
                so that the premiums collected over the life of such 
                mortgages will exceed the expected losses of such 
                mortgages to the Fund plus amounts sufficient to ensure

        under the direct endorsement program or insured by a mortgagee 
        pursuant to the delegation of authority under section 256 
        contains a material defect such that the mortgage should not 
        have been approved or endorsed for insurance, and a loan 
        becomes delinquent within 36 months of such approval or 
        endorsement leading to a default or the Secretary pays a claim 
        within 36 months after such approval or endorsement, the 
        Secretary may require the mortgagee approved by the Secretary 
        under the direct endorsement program or the mortgagee delegated 
        authority under section 256 to indemnify the Secretary for the 
        loss, irrespective of whether the violation caused the mortgage 
        default.
            ``(2) Fraud or misrepresentation.--If fraud or 
        misrepresentation was involved in connection with the 
        origination, the Secretary shall require the mortgagee approved

                process of the Secretary, to appeal any determination 
                of indemnification made by the Secretary pursuant to

        mortgages insured under this title that were originated on or 
        after the date of enactment of the FHA Solvency Act of 2013.

            ``(1) In general.--In conducting the review required under 
        subsection (a), for each mortgagee the Secretary shall compare 
        that mortgagee with other mortgagees originating or 
        underwriting insured single family mortgages based on the rates 
        of defaults and claims for insured single family mortgage loans 
        originated or underwritten by that mortgagee. The Secretary may 
        also compare that mortgagee with such other mortgagees based 
        on--
                    ``(A) underwriting quality;
                    ``(B) geographic area served; or
                    ``(C) any commonly used factors the Secretary deems 
                necessary for comparing mortgage default risk, provided 
                that such comparison is of factors that the Secretary 
                would expect to reduce the default risk of mortgages 
                insured by the Secretary.
            ``(2) Implementation.--In carrying out the comparisons 
        required under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall implement

                the Secretary may terminate the approval of a mortgagee 
                to originate or underwrite single family mortgages if 
                the Secretary determines that the mortgage loans 
                originated or underwritten by the mortgagee present an 
                unacceptable risk to the insurance funds.
                    ``(B) Basis for determining unacceptable risk.--For 
                purposes of subparagraph (A), a mortgagee may present 
                an unacceptable risk to the insurance funds based on--

        statistically sound models; and
            (2) include criteria, the evaluation of which has
