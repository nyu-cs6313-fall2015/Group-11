                                 A BILL


 
     To authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2015 for military 
activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and 
   for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe 
   military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Carl Levin 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Senator Carl Levin of Michigan was elected a member of 
        the United States Senate on November 7, 1978, for a full term 
        beginning January 3, 1979. He has served continuously in the 
        Senate since that date, and was appointed as a member of the 
        Committee on Armed Services in January 1979. He has served on 
        the Committee on Armed Services since that date, a period of 
        nearly 36 years.
            (2) A graduate of Detroit Central High School, Senator 
        Levin went on to Swarthmore College, and graduated from Harvard 
        Law School in 1959, gaining admittance to the Michigan bar. He 
        served his State as assistant attorney general and general 
        counsel of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission from 1964-1967, 
        and later served his hometown of Detroit as a member of the 
        Detroit City Council from 1969-1973, and as the council's 
        president from 1974-1977.
            (3) Senator Levin first served as chairman of the Committee 
        on Armed Services of the United States Senate for a period of 
        the 107th Congress, and has remained chairman since the 110th 
        Congress began in 2007. He has exercised extraordinary 
        leadership as either the chairman or ranking minority member of 
        the committee since the start of the 105th Congress in 1997.
            (4) Each year, for the past 52 years, the Committee on 
        Armed Services has reliably passed an annual defense 
        authorization act, and this will be the 36th that Senator Levin 
        has had a role in. In his capacity as member, ranking member, 
        and chairman, he has been an advocate for a strong national 
        defense, and has made lasting contributions to the security of 
        our Nation.
            (5) It is altogether fitting and proper that this Act, the 
        last annual authorization act for the national defense that 
        Senator Levin manages in and for the United States Senate as 
        chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, be named in his 
        honor, as provided in subsection (a).

SEC. 137. REPORT ON STATUS OF AIR-LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILE CAPABILITIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The capability provided by the nuclear-capable, air 
        launched cruise missile (ALCM) is critical to maintaining a 
        credible and effective air-delivery leg of the triad, 
        preserving the ability to respond to geopolitical and technical 
        surprise, and reassuring United States allies through credible 
        extended deterrence.
            (2) In its fiscal year 2015 budget request, the Air Force 
        delayed development of the Long Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO), 
        the follow-on for the ALCM, by three years.
            (3) The Air Force plans to sustain the current ALCM, known 
        as the AGM-86, until approximately 2030, with multiple service 
        life extension programs required to preserve but not enhance 
        existing ALCM capabilities.
            (4) The AGM-86 was initially developed in the 1970s and 
        deployed in the 1980s.
            (5) The average age of the ALCM inventory is over 30 years 
        old.
            (6) The operating environment, particularly the 
        sophistication of integrated air defenses, has evolved 
        substantially since the ALCM's inception.
            (7) The AGM-86 is no longer in production and the inventory 
        of spare bodies for required annual testing continues to 
        diminish, posing serious challenges for long-term sustainment.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Air Force, in 
        coordination with the Commander of the United States Strategic 
        Command, shall submit to the congressional defense committees a 
        report on the status of the current air-launched cruise missile 
        and the development of the follow-on system, the long-range 
        standoff weapon.
            (2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) 
        shall include the following elements:
                    (A) An assessment of the current system's 
                effectiveness and survivability through 2030, including 
                the impact of any degradation on the ability of the 
                United States Strategic Command to meet deterrence 
                requirements, such as the number of targets held at

        civilian and military law enforcement resources, such as new 
        technology and forensics information.

        practices between the Department of Defense and the Department

        Act and Office for Victims of Crime programs of the Department 
        of Justice.
    (b) Report.--The Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General 
shall jointly submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report 
on the framework required by subsection (a). The report shall--

    (a) Open Systems Approach Requirement.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and 
        (3), each Major Defense Acquisition Program and Major Automated 
        Information System, and each other acquisition program the 
        primary purpose of which is the acquisition of an information 
        technology system, that enters concept development after 
        January 1, 2016, shall use an open systems approach in 
        development to achieve agility, rapid capability enhancement, 
        interoperability, increased competition, and lower costs over 
        the life cycle of the program.
            (2) Case-by-case exception based on costs and 
        practicality.--The requirement under paragraph (1) shall not 
        apply to an acquisition program if a business case analysis 
        conducted at a point in development where there is sufficient 
        design information to conduct an independent life-cycle cost 
        estimate demonstrates that an open systems approach is more 
        expensive or is not practically achievable.
            (3) General exceptions.--
                    (A) Commercial off-the-shelf items and systems.--
                The requirement under paragraph (1) does not apply to 
                acquisition programs that consist primarily of

                decision is made to transition the program to a program 
                of record. In the event of such a transition, a 
                business case analysis shall be conducted to consider 
                the life-cycle costs of the program and determine 
                whether to migrate the system to an open systems 
                architecture.
    (b) Actions Required.--Not later than January 1, 2016, the 
Secretary of Defense shall take the following actions:

        based standards bodies to establish the standards required for 
        each of the Technical Reference Architectures and each set of 
        domain-specific services to support open systems approaches.
            (4) Ensure, in carrying out the actions set forth in 
        paragraphs (1) through (3), that there are not duplicative or 
        competing Technical Reference Architectures, domain-specific 
        services, or standards or standards bodies related to such 
        architectures and services across the Department of Defense.
    (c) Guidelines for Business Case Analyses.--Not later than July 1, 
2015, the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation shall

the case of the Department of Defense, a multiyear contract in amount 
equal to or greater than $500,000,000 may not be entered into under 
this section unless the contract is specifically authorized by law in 
an Act other than an appropriations Act.
    ``(2) In submitting a request for a specific authorization by law 
to carry out a defense acquisition program using multiyear contract 
authority under this section, the Secretary shall include in the 
request a report containing preliminary findings of the agency head 
required in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) together with 
the basis for such findings.
    ``(3) A multiyear contract may not be entered into under this 
section for a defense acquisition program that has been specifically 
authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority 
unless the Secretary of Defense certifies in writing, not later than 30 
days before entry into the contract, that each of the following 
conditions is satisfied:
            ``(A) The Secretary has determined that each of the 
        requirements in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) 
        will be met by such contract and has provided the basis for 
        such determination to the congressional defense committees.
            ``(B) The Secretary's determination under subparagraph (A) 
        was made after the completion of a cost analysis performed by 
        the Director of Cost Assessment and Program Analysis and such 
        analysis supports the findings.
            ``(C) The system being acquired pursuant to such contract 
        has not been determined to have experienced cost growth in 
        excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 
        section 2433(d) of this title within 5 years prior to the date 
        the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for 
        advance procurement entered into consistent with the 
        authorization for such contract) will be awarded.
            ``(D) A sufficient number of end items of the system being 
        acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within 
        the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost 
        or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that 
        current estimates of such unit costs are realistic.
            ``(E) During the fiscal year in which such contract is to 
        be awarded, sufficient funds will be available to perform the 
        contract in such fiscal year, and the future-years defense 
        program for such fiscal year will include the funding required 
        to execute the program without cancellation.
            ``(F) The contract is a fixed price type contract.
            ``(G) The proposed multiyear contract provides for 
        production at not less than minimum economic rates given the 
        existing tooling and facilities.
    ``(4) If for any fiscal year a multiyear contract to be entered 
into under this section is authorized by law for a particular 
procurement program and that authorization is subject to certain 
conditions established by law (including a condition as to cost savings 
to be achieved under the multiyear contract in comparison to specified 
other contracts) and if it appears (after negotiations with 
contractors) that such savings cannot be achieved, but that substantial 
savings could nevertheless be achieved through the use of a multiyear 
contract rather than specified other contracts, the President may 
submit to Congress a request for relief from the specified cost savings 
that must be achieved through multiyear contracting for that program. 
Any such request by the President shall include details about the 
request for a multiyear contract, including details about the 
negotiated contract terms and conditions.
    ``(5)(A) The Secretary may obligate funds for procurement of an end 
item under a multiyear contract for the purchase of property only for 
procurement of a complete and usable end item.
    ``(B) The Secretary may obligate funds appropriated for any fiscal 
year for advance procurement under a contract for the purchase of 
property only for the procurement of those long-lead items necessary in 
order to meet a planned delivery schedule for complete major end items 
that are programmed under the contract to be acquired with funds 
appropriated for a subsequent fiscal year (including an economic order 
quantity of such long-lead items when authorized by law).
    ``(6) The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph (3) 
notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the conditions of such 
certification are not met, if the Secretary determines that, due to 
exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear contract under 
this section is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and 
the Secretary provides the basis for such determination with the 
certification.
    ``(7) The Secretary may not delegate the authority to make the 
certification under paragraph (3) or the determination under paragraph 
(6) to an official below the level of Under Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Subsection (a)(7) of such section is 
amended by striking ``subparagraphs (C) through (F) of paragraph (1) of 
subsection (i)'' and inserting ``subparagraphs (C) through (F) of 
subsection (i)(3)''.

respect to requests for specific authorization by law to carry out 
defense acquisition programs using multiyear contract authority that 
are made on or after that date.

    (a) Authority To Transfer Authorizations.--
            (1) Authority.--Upon determination by the Secretary of

SEC. 1003. SENSE OF SENATE ON SEQUESTRATION.

    (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:
            (1) The budget of the President for fiscal year 2015, as 
        submitted to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, 
        United States Code, provides for significant reductions to the 
        military force structure and in military compensation over the 
        course of the future-years defense program, including proposals 
        to restrict pay raises for members of the Armed Forces below 
        the rate of inflation, freeze pay for general and flag 
        officers, reduce the growth of housing allowances by requiring 
        members of the Armed Forces to pay 5 percent out-of-pocket for 
        housing costs, reduce appropriated fund subsidies to the 
        defense commissaries, make significant changes to benefits 
        under the TRICARE program, reduce the end strength of the Army 
        by more than 60,000, retire the A-10 and U-2 aircraft of the 
        Air Force, inactivate half of the cruiser fleet of the Navy, 
        and reduce the size of the helicopter fleet of the Army by 25 
        percent and terminate the Ground Combat Vehicle program of the 
        Army.
            (2) These proposed reductions are the result of the budget 
        caps enacted by Congress in the Budget Control Act of 2011 and 
        reaffirmed (with some relief for fiscal years 2014 and 2015) in 
        the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2014, which cut more than 
        $900,000,000,000 from the planned Department of Defense budget 
        over a period of ten years. Under these budget caps, the 
        Department of Defense budget is unchanged from the funding 
        level in fiscal years 2013 and 2014, and remains more than 
        $30,000,000,000 below the funding provided to the Department in 
        fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012. In inflation-adjusted terms, 
        the drop is even greater, with a reduction of $75,000,000,000 
        since fiscal year 2010 and virtually no projected growth in 
        inflation-adjusted dollars through the balance of the future-
        years defense program.
            (3) If the budget caps remain unchanged for fiscal year 
        2016 and beyond, the Department of Defense will be required to 
        make even deeper cuts, including an additional reduction of 
        60,000 in the end strength of the Army, the retirement of the 
        entire KC-10 tanker aircraft fleet and the Global Hawk Block 40 
        fleet, reduced purchases of Joint Strike Fighters and unmanned 
        aerial vehicles, the inactivation of additional naval vessels, 
        reduced purchases of destroyers, and the elimination of an 
        aircraft carrier and a carrier air wing. Senior civilian and 
        military leaders of the Department of Defense have testified 
        that if these additional reductions are carried out, the United 
        States Armed Forces will not be able to carry out the National 
        Defense Strategy.
            (4) The budget of the President for fiscal year 2015 
        proposes to add $115,000,000,000 to the budget caps of the 
        Department of Defense for the four fiscal years starting in 
        fiscal year 2016 in order to avoid the need to make the 
        additional cuts described in paragraph (3). The budget proposes 
        to add an equal amount to the budget caps for the non-defense 
        agencies of the Federal Government in order to ensure that such 
        agencies can continue to meet their obligation to protect and 
        promote public safety, health, education, justice, 
        transportation, the environment, and other domestic needs.
    (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) leaving the budget caps described in subsection (a)(2) 
        for fiscal year 2016 and beyond unchanged would require cuts 
        that would seriously undermine the ability of the Department of 
        Defense to carry out its national security mission and reduce 
        the ability of other Federal Government agencies to adequately 
        address non-defense priorities; and
            (2) Congress should avoid these adverse impacts to the 
        national interests of the United States by enacting deficit-
        neutral legislation to increase the budget caps, offset by a 
        bipartisan comprehensive package.

made available for fiscal year 2015 for the Navy may be obligated or 
expended to conduct tasks connected to the inactivation of the U.S.S. 
George Washington (CVN-73) unless such tasks are identical to tasks 
that would be necessary to conduct a refueling and complex overhaul of 
the vessel.

SEC. 1022. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR RETIREMENT OR INACTIVATION OF 
              TICONDEROGA CLASS CRUISERS OR DOCK LANDING SHIPS.

    (a) Limitation on Availability of Funds.--
            (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided in this 
        section, none of the funds authorized to be appropriated or 
        otherwise made available for the Department of Defense by this 
        Act or the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
        2014 (Public Law 113-66) may be obligated or expended to 
        retire, prepare to retire, inactivate, or place in storage a 
        cruiser or dock landing ship.
            (2) Use of smosf funds.--Funds in the Ship, Modernization, 
        Operations, and Sustainment Fund (SMOSF) may be used only for 
        11 Ticonderoga-class cruisers (CG 63 through CG 73) and 3 dock 
        landing ships (LSD 41, LSD 42, and LSD 46). The Secretary of 
        the Navy may use such funds only to man, operate, equip, 
        sustain, and modernize such vessels.
    (b) Phased Modernization of Ticonderoga Class Cruisers and Dock 
Landing Ships.--The Secretary of the Navy shall retain 22 Ticonderoga-

        Navy shall include not less than 11 operational cruisers (CG 52 
        through CG 62) and 11 operational dock landing ships (all 
        members of the LSD 41 class, except LSD 41, LSD, 42 and LSD 
        46). For purposes of this paragraph, a cruiser or dock landing 
        ship is operational if such vessel is available for worldwide

        funds in the Ship, Modernization, Operations, and Sustainment 
        Fund are authorized to be available pursuant to subsection 
        (a)(2). During a phased modernization period, the Secretary may 
        reduce manning on such vessels to the minimal level necessary

        critical skills.
            (3) End of service and transition from phased modernization 
        to operational forces.--Cruisers covered by paragraph (1) may 
        only be decommissioned when replaced by one of the cruisers for 
        which the Navy has conducted a phased modernization using funds 
        in the Ship, Modernization, Operations, and Sustainment Fund as 
        described in paragraph (2). After being reintroduced into the 
        operational fleet, the cruisers modernized as described in 
        paragraph (2) may be decommissioned individually upon reaching 
        the end of their expected service life, excluding time spent in 
        a phased modernization status under paragraph (2). After being 
        reintroduced into the operational fleet, the dock landing ships 
        modernized as described in paragraph (2) may be decommissioned 
        upon reaching the end of their expected service life, excluded 
        time spent in a phased modernization status under paragraph 
        (2).
    (c) Requirements and Limitations on Phased Modernization.--
            (1) Requirements.--During the period of phased 
        modernization under subsection (b)(2) of the vessels specified 
        in subsection (a)(2), the Secretary of the Navy shall--
                    (A) continue to maintain the vessels in a manner 
                that will ensure the ability of the vessels to reenter 
                the operational fleet;
                    (B) conduct planning activities to ensure scheduled 
                and deferred maintenance and modernization work items 
                are identified and included in maintenance availability 
                work packages;
                    (C) conduct hull, mechanical, and electrical (HM&E) 
                and combat system modernization necessary to achieve a 
                service life of 40 years;
                    (D) in the case of the cruisers, schedule 
                completion of maintenance and modernization, including 
                required testing and crew training, to replace on a 
                one-for-one basis, active cruisers that will be 
                decommissioned upon reaching the end of their expected 
                service life;
                    (E) ensure adequate funds are available to execute 
                phased modernization activities for all the vessels.
            (2) Limitations.--During the period of phased modernization 
        under subsection (b)(2) of the vessels specified in subsection 
        (a)(2), the Secretary may not--
                    (A) permit removal or cannibalization of equipment 
                or systems to support operational vessels, other than--
                            (i) rotatable pool equipment; and
                            (ii) equipment or systems necessary to

                        only with the approval of the Secretary of 
                        Defense); or
                    (B) make any irreversible modifications that will 
                prohibit the vessel from reentering the operational 
                fleet.
    (d) Authority To Enter Into Economic Order Quantity Contracts.--The 
Secretary of the Navy may enter into a so-called ``economic order 
quantity'' contracts with private shipyards for ship maintenance and 
modernization, and with private industry for equipment procurement for 
the phased modernization under subsection (b)(2) of the vessels 
specified in subsection (a)(2).

            (3) No cause of action in decision not to transfer.--A 
        decision not to transfer a detainee to the United States under 
        this section shall not give rise to a judicial cause of action.
    (g) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--Subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) 
        shall take effect on the date, following the date on which the 
        Secretary of Defense submits to the appropriate committees of 
        Congress a detailed plan to close the detention facility at 
        United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that 
        Congress fails to enact a joint resolution disapproving such 
        report pursuant to subsection (i).
            (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall 
        contain the following:
                    (A) A case-by-case determination made for each 
                individual detained at Guantanamo of whether such 
                individual is intended to be transferred to a foreign 
                country, transferred to the United States for the 
                purpose of civilian or military trial, or transferred 
                to the United States or another country for continued 
                detention under the law of armed conflict.
                    (B) The specific facility or facilities that are 
                intended to be used, or modified to be used, to hold 
                individuals inside the United States for the purpose of 
                trial, for detention in the aftermath of conviction, or 
                for continued detention under the law of armed 
                conflict.
                    (C) The estimated costs associated with the 
                detention inside the United States of individuals 
                detained at Guantanamo.
                    (D) A description of the legal implications 
                associated with the detention inside the United States 
                of an individual detained at Guantanamo, including but 
                not limited to the right to challenge such detention as 
                unlawful.
                    (E) A detailed description and assessment, made in 
                consultation with the Secretary of State and the 
                Director of National Intelligence, of the actions that 
                would be taken prior to the transfer to a foreign 
                country of an individual detained at Guantanamo that 
                would substantially mitigate the risk of such 
                individual engaging or reengaging in any terrorist or 
                other hostile activity that threatens the United States 
                or United States person or interests.
                    (F) What additional authorities, if any, may be 
                necessary to detain an individual detained at 
                Guantanamo inside the United States as an unprivileged 
                enemy belligerent pursuant to the Authorization for Use 
                of Military Force, pending the end of hostilities or a 
                future determination by the Secretary of Defense that 
                such individual no longer poses a threat to the United 
                States or United States persons or interests.
            (3) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be

112-239; 126 Stat. 1911) shall apply to funds appropriated or otherwise 
made available for fiscal year 2015 for the Department of Defense from 
the date of the enactment of this Act until the effective date 
specified in subsection (g).
    (i) Consideration by Congress of Secretary of Defense Report.--
            (1) Terms of the resolution.--For purposes of this section 
        the term ``joint resolution'' means only a joint resolution 
        which is introduced within the 10-day period beginning on the 
        date on which the Secretary of Defense submits to Congress a 
        report under subsection (g) and--
                    (A) which does not have a preamble;
                    (B) the matter after the resolving clause of which 
                is as follows: ``That Congress disapproves the report 
                of the Secretary of Defense under section 1031(g) of 
                the Carl Levin National Defense Authorization Act for 
                Fiscal Year 2015 as submitted by the Secretary of 
                Defense to Congress on ______'', the blank space being 
                filled in with the appropriate date; and
                    (C) the title of which is as follows: ``Joint 
                resolution disapproving the Guantanamo Detention 
                Facility Closure report of the Secretary of Defense.''.
            (2) Referral.--A resolution described in paragraph (1) that 
        is introduced in the House of Representatives shall be referred 
        to the Committee on Armed Services of the House of 
        Representatives. A resolution described in paragraph (1) 
        introduced in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the Senate.
            (3) Discharge.--If the committee to which a resolution 
        described in paragraph (1) is referred has not reported such 
        resolution (or an identical resolution) by the end of the 20-
        day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary submits 
        to Congress a report under subsection (g), such committee shall 
        be, at the end of such period, discharged from further 
        consideration of such resolution, and such resolution shall be 
        placed on the appropriate calendar of the House involved.
            (4) Consideration.--(A) On or after the third day after the 
        date on which the committee to which such a resolution is 
        referred has reported, or has been discharged (under paragraph 
        (3)) from further consideration of, such a resolution, it is in 
        order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has 
        been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to 
        move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. A 
        Member may make the motion only on the day after the calendar 
        day on which the Member announces to the House concerned the 
        Member's intention to make the motion, except that, in the case 
        of the House of Representatives, the motion may be made without 
        such prior announcement if the motion is made by direction of 
        the committee to which the resolution was referred. All points 
        of order against the resolution (and against consideration of 
        the resolution) are waived. The motion is highly privileged in 
        the House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate 
        and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, 
        or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the 
        consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the 
        vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not 
        be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the 
        resolution is agreed to, the respective House shall immediately 
        proceed to consideration of the joint resolution without 
        intervening motion, order, or other business, and the 
        resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the 
        respective House until disposed of.
            (B) Debate on the resolution, and on all debatable motions 
        and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not 
        more than 2 hours, which shall be divided equally between those 
        favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the 
        resolution is not in order. A motion further to limit debate is 
        in order and not debatable. A motion to postpone, or a motion 
        to proceed to the consideration of other business, or a motion 
        to recommit the resolution is not in order. A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or 
        disagreed to is not in order.
            (C) Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a 
        resolution described in paragraph (1) and a single quorum call 
        at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with 
        the rules of the appropriate House, the vote on final passage 
        of the resolution shall occur.
            (D) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
        application of the rules of the Senate or the House of 
        Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating 
        to a resolution described in paragraph (1) shall be decided 
        without debate.
            (5) Consideration by other house.--(A) If, before the 
        passage by one House of a resolution of that House described in 
        paragraph (1), that House receives from the other House a 
        resolution described in paragraph (1), then the following 
        procedures shall apply:
                    (i) The resolution of the other House shall not be 
                referred to a committee and may not be considered in 
                the House receiving it except in the case of final 
                passage as provided in clause (ii)(II).
                    (ii) With respect to a resolution described in 
                paragraph (1) of the House receiving the resolution--
                            (I) the procedure in that House shall be 
                        the same as if no resolution had been received 
                        from the other House; but
                            (II) the vote on final passage shall be on 
                        the resolution of the other House.
            (B) Upon disposition of the resolution received from the 
        other House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the 
        resolution that originated in the receiving House.
            (6) Rules of the senate and the house of representatives.--
        This subsection is enacted by Congress--
                    (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the 
                Senate and House of Representatives, respectively, and 
                as such it is deemed a part of the rules of each House, 
                respectively, but applicable only with respect to the 
                procedure to be followed in that House in the case of a 
                resolution described in paragraph (1), and it 
                supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is 
                inconsistent with such rules; and
                    (B) with full recognition of the constitutional 
                right of either House to change the rules (so far as 
                relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, 
                in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the 
                case of any other rule of that House.

                death or imminent significant injury or harm to the 
                health of the individual, as soon as is practicable,

                medical care may reasonably be provided the individual

SEC. 1605. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DETERRENCE AND DEFENSE POSTURE OF THE 
              NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION.

    It is the sense of Congress that the United States reaffirms and 
remains committed to the policies enumerated in the Deterrence and 
Defense Posture Review of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, dated 
May 20, 2012, including the following statements:
            (1) ``The greatest responsibility of the Alliance is to 
        protect and defend our territory and our populations against 
        attack, as set out in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. The 
        Alliance does not consider any country to be its adversary. 
        However, no one should doubt NATO's resolve if the security of 
        any of its members were to be threatened. NATO will ensure that 
        it maintains the full range of capabilities necessary to deter 
        and defend against any threat to the safety and security of our 
        populations, wherever it should arise. Allies' goal is to 
        bolster deterrence as a core element of our collective defense 
        and contribute to the indivisible security of the Alliance.''.
            (2) ``Nuclear weapons are a core component of NATO's 
        overall capabilities for deterrence and defense alongside 
        conventional and missile defense forces. The review has shown 
        that the Alliance's nuclear force posture currently meets the 
        criteria for an effective deterrence and defense posture.''.
            (3) ``The circumstances in which any use of nuclear weapons 
        might have to be contemplated are extremely remote. As long as 
        nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance. The 
        supreme guarantee of the security of the Allies is provided by 
        the strategic nuclear forces of the Alliance, particularly 
        those of the United States; the independent strategic forces of 
        the United Kingdom and France, which have a deterrent role of 
        their own, contribute to the overall deterrence and security of 
        the Allies.''.
            (4) ``NATO must have the full range of capabilities 
        necessary to deter and defend against threats to the safety of 
        its populations and the security of its territory, which is the 
        Alliance's greatest responsibility.''.
            (5) ``NATO is committed to maintaining an appropriate mix 
        of nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities for 
        deterrence and defense to fulfill its commitments as set out in 
        the Strategic Concept. These capabilities, underpinned by 
        NATO's Integrated Command Structure, offer the strongest 
        guarantee of the Alliance's security and will ensure that it is 
        able to respond to a variety of challenges and unpredictable 
        contingencies in a highly complex and evolving international 
        security environment.''.

                  Subtitle B--Missile Defense Programs

SEC. 1611. HOMELAND BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has deployed the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, with 30 Ground-Based 
        Interceptors (GBIs) currently in Alaska and California, for 
        defense of the United States homeland against the threat of 
        limited ballistic missile attack from nations such as North 
        Korea and Iran.
            (2) The system has experienced several flight test failures 
        since 2010 involving the deployed Capability Enhancement-I and 
        Capability Enhancement-II Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicles (EKVs), 
        and the Missile Defense Agency plans to conduct an intercept 
        flight test in the summer of 2014 to demonstrate corrections to 
        the kill vehicles.
            (3) The Department of Defense is taking, and planning to 
        take, numerous actions to improve United States homeland 
        ballistic missile defense capabilities over the next decade to 
        keep pace with evolving ballistic missile threats, including 
        the following key actions:
                    (A) Deployment of 14 additional Ground-Based 
                Interceptors in Alaska by the end of 2017.
                    (B) Improvement of the sensor network that supports 
                homeland ballistic missile defense, including 
                deployment of a new Long-Range Discriminating Radar in 
                Alaska.
                    (C) Investment in improvements to the 
                discrimination capabilities needed to improve the 
                operational effectiveness and efficiency of the 
                homeland ballistic missile defense system.
                    (D) Re-design of the Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle 
                to increase significantly its performance, reliability, 
                cost-effectiveness, and affordability.
                    (E) Design and development of a Next Generation 
                Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle that will incorporate new 
                technologies and the potential for defeating multiple 
                threat objects with individual interceptors.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is a national priority to defend the United States 
        homeland against the threat of limited ballistic missile attack 
        from North Korea and Iran;
            (2) although the currently deployed Ground-based Midcourse 
        Defense system provides protection of the entire United States 
        homeland, including the East Coast, against the threat of 
        limited ballistic missile attack from North Korea and Iran, 
        this capability needs to be improved to meet evolving ballistic 
        missile threats;
            (3) the initial step in this process of improvement is to 
        correct the problems that caused the flight test failures with 
        the current kill vehicles, and to improve the reliability of 
        the deployed Ground-Based Interceptor fleet;
            (4) as indicated by senior Department of Defense officials, 
        investments to enhance homeland defense sensor and 
        discrimination capabilities are essential to improve the 
        operational effectiveness and shot doctrine of the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense system;
            (5) given limitations with the currently deployed Exo-
        atmospheric Kill Vehicles, it is important to re-design the 
        Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle using a rigorous acquisition 
        approach, including realistic testing, that can achieve a 
        demonstrated capability as soon as practicable using sound 
        acquisition principles and practices; and
            (6) in order to stay ahead of evolving ballistic missile 
        threats, the Department should design the Next Generation Exo-
        atmospheric Kill Vehicle to take full advantage of improvements 
        in sensors, discrimination, kill assessment, battle management, 
        and command and control, including the potential to engage 
        multiple objects.
    (c) Report Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall

SEC. 1612. REGIONAL BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the regional ballistic missile capabilities of 
        countries such as Iran and North Korea pose a serious and 
        growing threat to United States forward deployed forces, 
        allies, and partner countries;
            (2) given this growing threat, it is a high priority for 
        the United States to develop, test, and deploy effective 
        regional missile defense capabilities to provide the commanders 
        of the geographic combatant commands with capabilities to meet 
        their operational requirements, and for United States allies 
        and partners to improve their regional missile defense 
        capabilities;
            (3) the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization (NATO) partners should continue the development,

SEC. 1614. ACQUISITION PLAN FOR RE-DESIGNED EXO-ATMOSPHERIC KILL 
              VEHICLE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the existing models of the Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle 
        of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system are prototype 
        designs that were developed and deployed without robust and 
        rigorous acquisition practices;
            (2) consequently, the deployed models of the Exo-
        atmospheric Kill Vehicle have experienced flight test failures 
        since 2010, and have not demonstrated the degree of 
        reliability, robustness, cost-effectiveness, or performance 
        that are desirable;
            (3) the Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle for the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense system needs to be re-designed to improve 
        substantially its performance and reliability; and
            (4) in order to avoid repeating the problems with the 
        designs of the Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle, the Department of 
        Defense should follow a robust and rigorous acquisition plan 
        for the design, development, and testing of the re-designed 
        Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle.
    (b) Acquisition Plan Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
develop a robust acquisition plan for the re-design of the Exo-
atmospheric Kill Vehicle of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system 
that includes rigorous elements for system engineering, design, 
integration, development, testing, and evaluation.
    (c) Objectives.--The objectives of the acquisition plan required by 
subsection (b) shall be to ensure that the re-designed Exo-atmospheric 
Kill Vehicle is operationally effective, reliable, producible, cost-
effective, maintainable, and testable.
    (d) Approval of Acquisition Plan Required.--The acquisition plan 
required by subsection (b) shall be subject to approval by the Under 
Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.
    (e) Testing Required.--Prior to operational deployment of the re-
designed Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle, the Secretary shall ensure that 
it has demonstrated, through successful, operationally realistic flight 
testing, a high probability of working in an operationally effective 
manner and that it has the ability to accomplish its intended mission.
    (f) Report Required.--Not later than 60 days after the date on 
which the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and 
Logistics approves of the acquisition plan under subsection (d), the 
Director of the Missile Defense Agency shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees a report describing the acquisition 
plan and the manner in which it will meet the objectives described in 
subsection (c).

SEC. 1615. TESTING AND ASSESSMENT OF MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS PRIOR TO 
              PRODUCTION AND DEPLOYMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The initial acquisition approach to the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense system did not follow standard acquisition 
        practices, including the ``fly before you buy'' approach of 
        adequately testing and demonstrating the performance of major 
        defense systems before final production and deployment.
            (2) Consequently, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system 
        was deployed in 2004 without any intercept flight tests of the 
        production interceptor and kill vehicle, and was fielded with a 
        prototype experimental design kill vehicle that had not been 
        fully engineered, developed, or tested.
            (3) In July 2013, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system 
        had a flight test failure with the initially-deployed 
        Capability Enhancement-I Kill Vehicle because the kill vehicle 
        failed to separate from the booster.
            (4) The upgraded Capability Enhancement-II Kill Vehicle was 
        deployed starting in 2008, prior to any successful intercept 
        flight tests, and it has not had any successful intercept 
        flights test as of May 2014.
            (5) As a result of this highly concurrent acquisition 
        approach, the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system has had a 
        variety of kill vehicle problems that have caused several 
        flight test failures since 2010, which have required more than 
        $1,300,000,000 and four years of effort to correct.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is a high priority that United States ballistic 
        missile defense systems should work in an operationally 
        effective and cost-effective manner;
            (2) prior to making final production decisions for and 
        prior to operational deployment of such systems, the United 
        States should conduct operationally realistic intercept flight 
        testing, which should create sufficiently challenging 
        operational conditions to establish confidence that such 
        systems will work in an operationally effective and cost-
        effective manner when needed; and
            (3) in order to achieve these objectives, and to avoid 
        post-production and post-deployment problems like those 
        encountered with the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, it 
        is essential for the Department of Defense to follow a ``fly 
        before you buy'' approach to adequately test and assess the 
        elements of the Ballistic Missile Defense System before final 
        production decisions or operational deployment.
    (c) Successful Testing Required Prior to Final Production or 
Operational Deployment.--Prior to making a final production decision 
for, and prior to the operational deployment of, a new or substantially 
upgraded interceptor or weapon system of the Ballistic Missile Defense 
System, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure that--
            (1) sufficient and operationally realistic testing of the 
        system is conducted to assess the performance of the system in 
        order to inform a final production decision or an operational 
        deployment decision; and
            (2) the results of such testing have demonstrated a high 
        probability that the interceptor or weapon system will work in 
        an operationally effective manner and has the ability to 
        accomplish its intended mission.
    (d) Director of Operational Test and Evaluation Assessment.--Prior 
to any final production decision or operational deployment described in 
subsection (c), the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation shall--
            (1) provide to the Secretary the assessment of the 
        Director, based on the available test data, of the sufficiency, 
        adequacy, and results of the testing of such system, including 
        an assessment of whether the system will be sufficiently 
        effective, suitable, and survivable when needed; and
            (2) provide to the congressional defense committees a 
        written summary of that assessment.

SEC. 1631. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON RESOLUTION LIMITS ON COMMERCIAL SPACE 
              IMAGERY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense and the security of the 
        United States depend on the United States commercial space 
        imaging industry for mapping, intelligence, battle damage 
        assessment, coalition warfare, and humanitarian relief.
            (2) The Department of Defense could benefit from the 
        relaxation of the current limits on the resolution of the 
        imagery that the United States commercial space imaging 
        industry is permitted to sell because the industry will respond 
        to larger market opportunities by increasing the quantity of 
        spacecraft and the quality and diversity of the imagery and 
        imagery-derived products the industry provides.
            (3) The Department of Defense has a need to protect some 
        places and events from the collection and sale of high-
        resolution imagery. That need could be met through existing 
        licensing and contractual authorities that either permit the 
        government to exercise direct control of specific collection 
        tasking and image dissemination or to restrict collection.
            (4) Instead of using the approach described in paragraph 
        (3), the United States commercial space imaging industry has 
        been prohibited from selling imagery over the vast majority of 
        the planet where there are no national security sensitivities.
            (5) Limits on the resolution of commercial space imaging 
        have been relaxed somewhat in the past, but only when the 
        United States commercial space imaging industry has faced 
        competition from foreign providers of such imaging.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Secretary of Defense should support relaxation, as 
        soon as practicable, of panchromatic, spectral, and infrared 
        imagery resolution limits so that the United States commercial 
        space imaging industry may promptly begin--
                    (A) to attract investment in new satellite 
                capabilities;
                    (B) to design and build new satellites; and
                    (C) to create new processing capabilities, business 
                strategies, and marketing capacity; and
            (2) the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy should 
        provide a recommendation to Congress by April 1, 2015, on the 
        design and development of a flexible and dynamic capability to 
        control the collection and sale of commercial space imagery to 
        protect national security.
