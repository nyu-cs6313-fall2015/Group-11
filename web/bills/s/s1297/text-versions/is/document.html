    (b) Consideration in the House of Representatives.--

        shall report it to the House without amendment not later than 
        15 days after the date on which the bill is referred to the 
        committee. If a committee fails to report the implementation 
        bill within that period, it shall be in order to move that the 
        House discharge the committee from further consideration of the 
        bill. Such a motion shall not be in order after the last 
        committee authorized to consider the bill reports it to the 
        House or after the House has disposed of a motion to discharge 
        the bill. The previous question shall be considered as ordered 
        on the motion to its adoption without intervening motion except 
        20 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the 
        proponent and an opponent. If such a motion is adopted, the 
        House shall proceed immediately to consider the implementation 
        bill in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3). A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the motion is disposed of shall 
        not be in order.
            (2) Proceeding to consideration.--After the last committee 
        authorized to consider an implementation bill reports it to the 
        House or has been discharged (other than by motion) from its 
        consideration, it shall be in order to move to proceed to 
        consider the implementation bill in the House. Such a motion 
        shall not be in order after the House has disposed of a motion 
        to proceed with respect to the implementation bill. The 
        previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion 
        to its adoption without intervening motion. A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the motion is disposed of shall 
        not be in order.
            (3) Consideration.--An implementation bill shall be 
        considered as read. All points of order against the 
        implementation bill and against its consideration are waived. 
        The previous question shall be considered as ordered on an 
        implementation bill to its passage without intervening motion 
        except 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the 
        proponent and an opponent and one motion to limit debate on the

            (4) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage of an 
        implementation bill shall occur not later than 90 days after 
        the date on which the implementation bill is submitted to 
        Congress.
    (c) Expedited Procedure in the Senate.--
            (1) Committee consideration.--An implementation bill 
        introduced in the Senate under subsection (a) shall be jointly 
        referred to the committee or committees of jurisdiction, which 
        committees shall report the bill without any revision and with 
        a favorable recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or 
        without recommendation, not later than 15 days after the date 
        on which the implementation bill is referred to the committee. 
        If any committee fails to report the bill within that period, 
        that committee shall be automatically discharged from 
        consideration of the bill, and the bill shall be placed on the 
        appropriate calendar.
            (2) Motion to proceed.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order, not later than 2 
        days of session after the date on which an implementation bill 
        is reported or discharged from all committees to which it was 
        referred, for the majority leader of the Senate or the majority 
        leader's designee to move to proceed to the consideration of 
        the implementation bill. It shall also be in order for any 
        Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of 
        the implementation bill at any time after the conclusion of 
        such 2-day period. A motion to proceed is in order even though 
        a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to. All 
        points of order against the motion to proceed to the 
        implementation bill are waived. The motion to proceed is not 
        debatable. The motion is not subject to a motion to postpone. A 
        motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to 
        or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed 
        to the consideration of the implementation bill is agreed to, 
        the implementation bill shall remain the unfinished business 
        until disposed of.
            (3) Consideration.--All points of order against an 
        implementation bill and against consideration of an 
        implementation bill are waived. Consideration of an 
        implementation bill and of all debatable motions and appeals in 
        connection therewith shall not exceed a total of 30 hours which 
        shall be divided equally between the majority and minority 
        leaders or their designees. A motion further to limit debate on 
        an implementation bill is in order, shall require an 
        affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and 
        sworn, and is not debatable. Any debatable motion or appeal is 
        debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, to be divided equally 
        between those favoring and those opposing the motion or appeal. 
        All time used for consideration of an implementation bill, 
        including time used for quorum calls and voting, shall be 
        counted against the total 30 hours of consideration.
            (4) No amendments.--An amendment to an implementation bill, 
        or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the 
        consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit an 
        implementation bill, is not in order.
            (5) Vote on passage.--If the Senate has voted to proceed to 
        an implementation bill, the vote on passage of an 
        implementation bill shall occur immediately following the 
        conclusion of the debate on an implementation bill, and a 
        single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if 
        requested. The vote on passage of an implementation bill shall 
        occur not later than 90 days after the date on which the 
        implementation bill is submitted to Congress.
            (6) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the

        of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to 
        an implementation bill shall be decided without debate.
    (d) Amendment.--An implementation bill shall not be subject to 
amendment in either the House of Representatives or the Senate.
    (e) Consideration by the Other House.--
            (1) In general.--If, before passing an implementation bill, 
        one House receives from the other an implementation bill--
                    (A) the implementation bill of the other House 
                shall not be referred to a committee; and
                    (B) the procedure in the receiving House shall be 
                the same as if no implementation bill had been received 
                from the other House until the vote on passage, when 
                the implementation bill received from the other House 
                shall supplant the implementation bill of the receiving 
                House.
            (2) Revenue measure.--This subsection shall not apply to 
        the House of Representatives if the implementation bill 
        received from the Senate is a revenue measure.
    (f) Rules To Coordinate Action With Other House.--
            (1) Treatment of implementation bill of other house.--If 
        the Senate fails to introduce or consider an implementation 
        bill under this section, the implementation bill of the House 
        shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under this 
        section.
            (2) Treatment of companion measures in the senate.--If 
        following passage of an implementation bill in the Senate, the 
        Senate then receives the implementation bill from the House of 
        Representatives, the House-passed implementation bill shall not 
        be debatable. The vote on passage of the implementation bill in 
        the Senate shall be considered to be the vote on passage of the 
        implementation bill received from the House of Representatives.
            (3) Vetoes.--If the President vetoes an implementation 
        bill, debate on a veto message in the Senate under this section 
        shall be 1 hour equally divided between the majority and 
        minority leaders or their designees.
    (g) Loss of Privilege.--The provisions of this section shall cease 
to apply to an implementation bill if the implementation bill does not 
pass both Houses not later than 180 days after the implementation bill 
is submitted to Congress.
