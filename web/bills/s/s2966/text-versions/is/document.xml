					<enum>(3)</enum>
					<text>Critical care
			 medicine encompasses a wide array of diseases and health issues. The care
			 provided in the ICU is highly specialized and complex due to the extreme
			 severity of illness of its patient population, often involving multiple

					<enum>(5)</enum>
					<text>According to a
			 2006 report by the Health Resources and Services Administration
			 (referred to in this section as <quote>HRSA</quote>), demand in the United States for critical care medical
			 services is on the rise, due in part to the growing elderly population, as

			 services.</text>

					<enum>(6)</enum>
					<text>The HRSA report
			 also found that the growing aging population will further exacerbate an
			 existing shortage of intensivists, the physicians certified in critical
			 care
			 who primarily deliver care in intensive care units, potentially
			 compromising
			 the quality and availability of care. Today, intensivist-led teams treat
			 only
			 one-third of critically ill patients despite substantial evidence that
			 these
			 teams lead to improved outcomes.</text>
