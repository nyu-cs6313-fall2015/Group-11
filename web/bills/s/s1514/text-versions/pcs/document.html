SEC. 101. PROHIBITION ON ENERGY TAX.

    (a) Findings; Purposes.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) on June 25, 2013, President Obama issued a 
                Presidential memorandum directing the Administrator of 
                the Environmental Protection Agency to issue 
                regulations relating to power sector carbon pollution 
                standards for existing coal fired power plants;
                    (B) the issuance of that memorandum circumvents 
                Congress and the will of the people of the United 
                States;
                    (C) any action to control emissions of greenhouse 
                gases from existing coal fired power plants in the 
                United States by mandating a national energy tax would 
                devastate major sectors of the economy, cost thousands 
                of jobs, and increase energy costs for low-income 
                households, small businesses, and seniors on fixed 
                income;
                    (D) joblessness increases the likelihood of 
                hospital visits, illnesses, and premature deaths;
                    (E) according to testimony on June 15, 2011, before 
                the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the 
                Senate by Dr. Harvey Brenner of Johns Hopkins 
                University, ``The unemployment rate is well established 
                as a risk factor for elevated illness and mortality 
                rates in epidemiological studies performed since the 
                early 1980s. In addition to influences on mental 
                disorder, suicide and alcohol abuse and alcoholism, 
                unemployment is also an important risk factor in 
                cardiovascular disease and overall decreases in life 
                expectancy.'';
                    (F) according to the National Center for Health 
                Statistics, ``children in poor families were four times 
                as likely to be in fair or poor health as children that 
                were not poor'';
                    (G) any major decision that would cost the economy 
                of the United States millions of dollars and lead to 
                serious negative health effects for the people of the 
                United States should be debated and explicitly 
                authorized by Congress, not approved by a Presidential 
                memorandum or regulations; and
                    (H) any policy adopted by Congress should make 
                United States energy as clean as practicable, as 
                quickly as practicable, without increasing the cost of 
                energy for struggling families, seniors, low-income 
                households, and small businesses.
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
                    (A) to ensure that--
                            (i) a national energy tax is not imposed on 
                        the economy of the United States; and
                            (ii) struggling families, seniors, low-
                        income households, and small businesses do not 
                        experience skyrocketing electricity bills and 
                        joblessness;
                    (B) to protect the people of the United States, 
                particularly families, seniors, and children, from the 
                serious negative health effects of joblessness;
                    (C) to allow sufficient time for Congress to 
                develop and authorize an appropriate mechanism to 
                address the energy needs of the United States and the 
                potential challenges posed by severe weather; and
                    (D) to restore the legislative process and 
                congressional authority over the energy policy of the 
                United States.
    (b) Presidential Memorandum.--Notwithstanding any other provision 
of law, the head of a Federal agency shall not promulgate any 
regulation relating to power sector carbon pollution standards or any 
substantially similar regulation on or after June 25, 2013, unless that 
regulation is explicitly authorized by an Act of Congress.
