(Thus exempts an entity entering into a utility operations-related swap with a utility special entity from mandatory registration as a swap dealer.)\n\nRequires transactions in utility operations-related swaps to be reported according to requirements for the reporting of uncleared swaps.\n\nDefines \"utility special entity\" as a special entity, or any instrumentality, department, or corporation of or established by a state or local government, that: (1) owns or operates an electric or natural gas facility or an electric or natural gas operation; (2) supplies natural gas or electric energy to another utility special entity; (3) has public service obligations under federal, state, or local law or regulation to deliver electric energy or natural gas service to customers; or (4) is a federal power marketing agency.\n\nRedefines swap to include a utility operations-related swap.\n\nDefines \"utility operations-related swap\" as one that: (1) is entered into to hedge or mitigate commercial risk; (2) is associated with specified transactions in electric energy or natural gas; and (3) is not a contract, agreement, or transaction based on, derived on, or referencing\n\n an interest rate, credit, equity, or currency asset class; or a metal, agricultural commodity, or crude oil or gasoline commodity of any grade, except as used as fuel for electric energy generation."
