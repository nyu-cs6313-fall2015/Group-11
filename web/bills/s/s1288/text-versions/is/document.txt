Civil Procedure is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``may'' and inserting 
        ``shall'';
            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``Rule 5'' and all that 
        follows through ``motion.'' and inserting ``rule 5.''; and

        parties the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred as a 
        direct result of the violation, including reasonable attorneys'
