        of the Interior may order the revocation of a withdrawal and 
        reservation established by this Act.
            (2) Revocation order.--To carry out a revocation under

                opened to the operation of some or all of the public 
                land laws, including the mining laws.
    (f) Acceptance by Secretary of the Interior.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in this section requires the 
        Secretary of the Interior to accept the land proposed for 
        relinquishment if the Secretary determines that the land is not 
        suitable for return to the public domain.
            (2) Notice.--If the Secretary makes a determination that 
        the land is not suitable for return to the public domain, the
