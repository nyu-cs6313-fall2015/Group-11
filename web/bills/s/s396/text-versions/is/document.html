SEC. 4. ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE.

    (a) Purpose of State Revolving Fund.--Section 601(a) of the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1381(a)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``and'' the first place it appears; and
            (2) by inserting after ``section 320'' the following: ``, 
        and (4) for the implementation of requirements to monitor for 
        sewer overflows under section 402''.
    (b) Water Pollution Control Revolving Loan Funds.--Section 603(c) 
of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1383(c)) is 
amended--

        following: ``, and (4) for the implementation of requirements 
        to monitor for sewer overflows under section 402''.

SEC. 5. EFFECT OF ACT.

    Nothing in this Act or an amendment made by this Act--
            (1) limits the ability of any State to implement or enforce 
        a more stringent monitoring or notification standard than the 
        applicable standard under the Federal Water Pollution Control 
        Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.);
            (2) authorizes any sewer overflow; or
            (3) supplants or diminishes any obligation to comply with 
        any requirement of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 
        U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) or any other Federal or State law.
