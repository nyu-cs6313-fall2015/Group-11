                                 A BILL


 
To amend the National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
Organization Act to create a Federal Spectrum Reallocation Commission, 
to provide for the use of a portion of the proceeds from the auction of 
   reallocated Federal spectrum for deficit reduction, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Maximizing Spectrum Efficiency and 
Value Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Demand for electromagnetic spectrum is sharply rising 
        due to the growing advanced network of communications devices 
        that rely on spectrum to transmit and receive information.
            (2) It is necessary for the United States to maintain its 
        investments in innovation of spectrum and broadband 
        infrastructure to ensure the United States is a global leader 
        in the wireless age.
            (3) Spectrum is a finite resource, and in order to spur 
        innovation, the United States must provide for better and more 
        efficient spectrum management.
            (4) Many spectrum holders do not efficiently use their 
        frequency assignments, and a restructuring of the usable 
        spectrum is a viable solution to make up for this lost 
        opportunity.
            (5) Making available additional spectrum to meet the 
        demands of broadband technologies and services will prevent 
        dropped connections, blocked service, decreased connection 
        speed, and even higher prices for certain advanced 
        applications.
            (6) The availability of increased spectrum will allow 
        advanced technologies such as 4G mobile services, high-speed 
        wireless, high definition television, and more to continue 
        operating without network problems and interference.
            (7) The United States public debt totals not less than 
        $14,300,000,000,000.
            (8) Congress should look for ways to increase Federal 
        Government revenues without creating additional burdens on 
        taxpayers.
            (9) Auctioning spectrum is the most economically sound 
        method for accurate valuation and assignment of spectrum to 
        develop the next generation of wireless technologies, expand 
        broadband service to underserved areas of the country, develop 
        an interoperable public safety network, and reduce the deficit.
            (10) Certain frequencies of spectrum have substantial 
        market value and could raise significant new revenue in a 
        public auction.
            (11) Barriers to a spectrum auction such as regulatory and 
        administrative delays are not conducive to the free-market 
        approach and can hurt innovation.
            (12) Federal Government spectrum, while extremely 
        important, is vast and should be included in any spectrum 
        reform initiative.
