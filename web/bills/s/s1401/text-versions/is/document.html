    (a) Draft Methodology.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal 
Register for public comment a draft methodology for determining which 
minerals qualify as critical minerals based on an assessment of whether 
the minerals are--
            (1) subject to potential supply restrictions (including 
        restrictions associated with foreign political risk, abrupt 
        demand growth, military conflict, and anti-competitive or 
        protectionist behaviors); and

        defense-, agriculture-, and health care-related applications).
    (b) Availability of Data.--If available data is insufficient to 
provide a quantitative basis for the methodology developed under this 
section, qualitative evidence may be used.
    (c) Final Methodology.--After reviewing public comments on the 
draft methodology under subsection (a) and updating the draft 
methodology as appropriate, the Secretary shall enter into an 
arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences and the National 
Academy of Engineering to obtain, not later than 120 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act--
            (1) a review of the methodology; and
            (2) recommendations for improving the methodology.
    (d) Final Methodology.--After reviewing the recommendations under 
subsection (c), not later than 150 days after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a 
description of the final methodology for determining which minerals 
qualify as critical minerals.

SEC. 803. POLICY.

    (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to promote an 
adequate, reliable, domestic, and stable supply of critical minerals, 
produced in an environmentally responsible manner, in order to 
strengthen and sustain the economic security, and the manufacturing, 
industrial, energy, technological, and competitive stature, of the 
United States.
    (b) Coordination.--The President, acting through the Executive 
Office of the President, shall coordinate the actions of Federal 
agencies under this and other Acts--
            (1) to encourage Federal agencies to facilitate the 
        availability, development, and environmentally responsible 
        production of domestic resources to meet national critical 
        minerals needs;
            (2) to minimize duplication, needless paperwork, and delays 
        in the administration of applicable laws (including 
        regulations) and the issuance of permits and authorizations 
        necessary to explore for, develop, and produce critical 
        minerals and to construct and operate critical mineral 
        manufacturing facilities in an environmentally responsible 
        manner;
            (3) to promote the development of economically stable and 
        environmentally responsible domestic critical mineral 
        production and manufacturing;
            (4) to establish an analytical and forecasting capability 
        for identifying critical mineral demand, supply, and other 
        market dynamics relevant to policy formulation so that informed 
        actions may be taken to avoid supply shortages, mitigate price 
        volatility, and prepare for demand growth and other market 
        shifts;
            (5) to strengthen educational and research capabilities and 
        workforce training;
            (6) to bolster international cooperation through technology 
        transfer, information sharing, and other means;
            (7) to promote the efficient production, use, and recycling 
        of critical minerals;
            (8) to develop alternatives to critical minerals; and
            (9) to establish contingencies for the production of, or 
        access to, critical minerals for which viable sources do not 
        exist within the United States.

SEC. 804. RESOURCE ASSESSMENT.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 4 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, in consultation with applicable State (including 
geological surveys), local, academic, industry, and other entities, the 
Secretary shall complete a comprehensive national assessment of each 
critical mineral that--
            (1) identifies and quantifies known critical mineral 
        resources, using all available public and private information 
        and datasets, including exploration histories;
            (2) estimates the cost of production of the critical 
        mineral resources identified and quantified under this section, 
        using all available public and private information and 
        datasets, including exploration histories;
            (3) provides a quantitative and qualitative assessment of 
        undiscovered critical mineral resources throughout the United 
        States, including probability estimates of tonnage and grade, 
        using all available public and private information and 
        datasets, including exploration histories;
            (4) provides qualitative information on the environmental 
        attributes of the critical mineral resources identified under 
        this section; and

        quantification of critical mineral resources on Federal land 
        that is open to location and entry for exploration, 
        development, and other uses.
    (b) Field Work.--If existing information and datasets prove 
insufficient to complete the assessment under this section and there is 
no reasonable opportunity to obtain the information and datasets from 
nongovernmental entities, the Secretary may carry out field work 
(including drilling, remote sensing, geophysical surveys, geological 
mapping, and geochemical sampling and analysis) to supplement existing 
information and datasets available for determining the existence of 
critical minerals on--
            (1) Federal land that is open to location and entry for 
        exploration, development, and other uses;
            (2) tribal land, at the request and with the written

State or an Indian tribe, the Secretary may provide technical 
assistance to State governments and Indian tribes conducting critical 
mineral resource assessments on non-Federal land.

governments, or Indian tribes and economic development entities of 
Indian tribes, to cover the costs associated with assessments of 
critical mineral resources on State or tribal land, as applicable.

this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the applicable committees a 
report describing the results of the assessment conducted under this 
section.
    (f) Prioritization.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may sequence the completion

        critical materials considered to be most critical under the 
        methodology established pursuant to section 802 are completed 
        first.
            (2) Reporting.--If the Secretary sequences the completion 
        of resource assessments for each critical material, the 
        Secretary shall submit a report under subsection (e) on an 
        iterative basis over the 4-year period beginning on the date of 
        enactment of this Act.
    (g) Updates.--The Secretary shall periodically update the 
assessment conducted under this section based on--
            (1) the generation of new information or datasets by the 
        Federal Government; or
