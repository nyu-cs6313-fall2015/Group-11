                        payment methodology under the demonstration 
                        program has improved the quality of patient

                        beneficiaries under this title and the impact

                        ability of hospice programs to furnish quality 
                        care to beneficiaries under this title.

                        together with recommendations for such 
                        legislation and administrative action as the 
                        Secretary determines appropriate.
                    ``(iii) Budget neutrality.--With respect to the 2-
                year period of the demonstration program, the Secretary 
                shall ensure that revisions in payment implemented as 
                part of the demonstration program shall result in the 
                same estimated amount of aggregate payments under this 
                title for hospice care for the programs participating 
                in the demonstration as would have been made if the 
                hospice programs had not participated in the 
                demonstration program.''.
