  <summary>12/17/2013--Reported to Senate amended.
Violent Content Research Act of 2013 - Directs the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HSS), jointly, to undertake to enter into appropriate arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a comprehensive study and investigation of whether exposure to violent video games and programming has a harmful effect on children that is distinguishable from any other factors.

Requires such study and investigation to consider whether: (1) such exposure causes children to act aggressively or causes other measurable harm to children, has a disproportionately harmful effect on the behavior of children already prone to aggression or on the behavior of other identifiable groups of children, and has a harmful effect that is distinguishable from other types of media; (2) any identified harm has a direct and long-lasting impact on a child's well-being; and (3) current or emerging characteristics of violent video games have a uniquely harmful effect on the behavior of children, considering video games' concretely interactive nature.

Requires an identification of gaps in current research which, if closed, could provide information regarding any causal connection between such exposure and children's behavior.

Requires such agencies, in entering into any such arrangements, to request the NAS to report the results to Congress, FTC, FCC, and HSS.</summary>
