    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

<DELETED>    (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal 
Communications Commission, and the Department of Health and Human 
Services, jointly, shall undertake to enter into appropriate 
arrangements with the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a 
comprehensive study and investigation of--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) whether there is a connection between exposure 
        to violent video games and harmful effects on children; 
        and</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (2) whether there is a connection between exposure 
        to violent video programming and harmful effects on 
        children.</DELETED>
<DELETED>    (b) Contents of Study and Investigation.--</DELETED>
        <DELETED>    (1) Violent video games.--The study and 
        investigation under subsection (a) shall include--</DELETED>
                <DELETED>    (A) whether the exposure listed under 
                subsection (a)(1)--</DELETED>
                        <DELETED>    (i) causes children to act 
                        aggressively or causes other measurable harm to 
                        children;</DELETED>
                        <DELETED>    (ii) has a disproportionately 
                        harmful effect on children already prone to 
                        aggressive behavior or on other identifiable 
                        groups of children; and</DELETED>
                        <DELETED>    (iii) has a harmful effect that is

shall undertake to enter into appropriate arrangements with the 
National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study and 
investigation of--
            (1) whether there is a connection between exposure to

        distinguishable from the effects of any other factors; and
            (2) whether there is a connection between exposure to 
        violent video programming and harmful effects on children that 
        is distinguishable from the effects of any other factors.
    (b) Contents of Study and Investigation.--
            (1) Violent video games.--The study and investigation under 
        subsection (a) shall include--
                    (A) whether the exposure listed under subsection

                        causes other measurable harm to children;
                            (ii) has a disproportionately harmful 
                        effect on the behavior of children already 
                        prone to aggression or on the behavior of other
