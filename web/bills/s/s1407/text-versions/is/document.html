                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                             July 31, 2013

 Mr. Casey (for himself and Mr. Rubio) introduced the following bill; 
     which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, 
                     Education, Labor, and Pensions

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to 
strengthen elementary and secondary computer science education, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Computer Science Education and Jobs 
Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Computer science is transforming industry, creating new 
        fields of commerce, driving innovation in all fields of 
        science, and bolstering productivity in established economic 
        sectors.
            (2) The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that there will 
        be 9,200,000 jobs in the fields of science, technology, 
        engineering, and mathematics by the year 2020. Half of these, 
        or 4,600,000 jobs, will be in computing.
            (3) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2012, 
        the national median annual salary was $45,790, and the average 
        annual salary in computer and mathematical occupations was 
        $80,180.
            (4) Elementary and secondary computer science education 
        gives students a deeper knowledge of the fundamentals of 
        computing, yielding critical thinking skills that will serve 
        students throughout their lives in numerous fields.
            (5) Students who take the College Board's AP computer 
        science examination are 8 times more likely to major in 
        computer science in college. Unfortunately, the College Board 
        reports that in 2012, less than 3,000 of the 40,000 high 
        schools in the United States offered AP computer science 
        examinations.
            (6) Only 14 States allow computer science courses to count 
        toward secondary school core graduation requirements, chilling 
        student interest in computer science courses.
            (7) The Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) has 
        found that many States do not have a certification or licensure 
        process for computer science teachers. Where processes do 
        exist, they often have no connection to rigorous computer 
        science content.
            (8) Computer science education has been encumbered by 
        confusion regarding the related but distinct concepts of 
        computer science education, technology education, and the use 
        of technology in education.
            (9) The Association for Computing Machinery and the CSTA 
        have established a clear 4-part, grade-appropriate framework of 
        standards for computer science education to guide State reform 
        efforts.
            (10) With the growing importance of computing in society, 
        the need for students to understand the fundamentals of 
        computing, and the significant challenges elementary and 
        secondary computer science education faces, broad support for 
        computer science education is needed to catalyze reform.
