  <summary>1/27/2014--Introduced.
Chemical Safety and Drinking Water Protection Act of 2014 - Amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or each state exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems to carry out a state chemical storage facility source water protection program.

Requires such a program to provide for oversight and inspection of each covered chemical storage facility in accordance with minimum requirements, described in this Act, to prevent the release of chemicals into the water supply in watersheds with public water systems that rely on surface water, including a covered chemical storage facility located pursuant to a source water quality assessment (carried out upon state modification of monitoring requirements). Defines "covered chemical storage facility" as a facility at which a chemical is stored and the Administrator or state determines that a release from the facility poses a risk of harm to a public water system.

Deems a state program and its requirements, for purposes of primary enforcement responsibility, to be part of the national primary drinking water regulations and requires that they be implemented and enforced in accordance with the procedures applicable to such responsibility.

Authorizes the issuance of orders by the Administrator to carry out this Act.

Sets forth requirements concerning: (1) liability of a facility owner or operator for costs of response actions, (2) pre-transfer inspections of facilities, and (3) information for public water systems regarding emergency response plans and chemical inventories.

Authorizes an owner or operator of a public water system to commence, or to petition the Administrator to commence, a civil action for equitable relief to address possible imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons supplied by the water system. Provides a special rule to expedite the Administrator's response to a petition in emergency situations.</summary>
