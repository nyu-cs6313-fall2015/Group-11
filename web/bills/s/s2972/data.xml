  <summary>12/3/2014--Introduced.
Christen O'Donnell Equestrian Helmet Safety Act of 2014 - Requires equestrian helmets manufactured after a specified date to meet: (1) certain ASTM International standards if the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has not established a standard, and (2) CPSC standards incorporating those ASTM standards if the CPSC has established a standard.

Authorizes the CPSC to promulgate equestrian helmet standards incorporating ASTM standards. Exempts any such CPSC-promulgated standard from judicial review, a reliance on voluntary standards, and other procedural requirements that normally apply to such proceedings.

Requires helmets that fail to meet standards required by this Act to be treated as a violation of a consumer product safety standard promulgated under the Consumer Product Safety Act.</summary>
