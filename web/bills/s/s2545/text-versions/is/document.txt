                described in subparagraph (A) and knew, or reasonably 
                should have known, that the employee contributed to 
                such purposeful omission; and
            (2) received a bonus in part because of such omission.
    (b) Reports Described.--A report described in this subsection is a

            (1) In general.--For each employee identified under 
        subsection (a) who received a bonus as described in such 
        subsection, the Secretary shall, after notice and an

                Protection Board shall set aside an order issued under 
                paragraph (1) if the issuing of the order was clearly

                process.
