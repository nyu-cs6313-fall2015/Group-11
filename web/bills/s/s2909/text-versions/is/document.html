                                 A BILL


 
   To authorize a comprehensive strategic approach for United States 
   foreign assistance to developing countries to end extreme global 
   poverty and hunger, achieve food and nutrition security, promote 
    endurable, long-term, agricultural-led economic growth, improve 
    nutritional outcomes, especially for women and children, build 
resilient, adaptive, local capacity of vulnerable populations, and for 
                        other related purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Global Food Security Act of 2014''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization 
        (FAO), 805,000,000 people worldwide suffer from chronic hunger. 
        Hunger and malnutrition rob people of health and productive 
        lives and stunt the mental and physical development of future 
        generations.
            (2) According to the January 2014 Worldwide Threat 
        Assessment of the United States Intelligence Community report, 
        the ``[l]ack of adequate food will be a destabilizing factor in 
        countries important to U.S. national security that do not have 
        the financial or technical abilities to solve their internal 
        food security problems'' and ``[f]ood and nutrition insecurity 
        in weakly governed countries might also provide opportunities 
        for insurgent groups to capitalize on poor conditions, exploit 
        international food aid, and discredit governments for their 
        inability to address basic needs''.
            (3) Decades of research have shown that there are multiple 
        underlying causes of food insecurity and poor nutrition, 
        including the lack of availability of, access to, and 
        consumption of nutritious food, limited investments to improve 
        agricultural productivity, insufficient value chains and market 
        development for farmers, including small-scale producers, 
        leading to post-harvest loss, and weak institutions in 
        government and civil society.
            (4) Agriculture, which comprises large portions of the 
        total labor force in many developing countries, is an essential 
        component of inclusive economic growth. According to the World 
        Bank's 2008 World Development Report, growth in the 
        agricultural sector has been twice as effective in reducing 
        poverty as growth in other sectors.
            (5) Women, who are often heads of households and small 
        farmers, are especially vulnerable to food insecurity. Women 
        frequently face stricter constraints than men in accessing 
        markets and resources. In its 2010-2011 report, the FAO 
        estimated that if women farmers had the same access to inputs 
        as men, they could increase their farm yields by 20 to 30 
        percent. According to the FAO, this ``could raise total 
        agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5-4 percent''.
            (6) More than 165,000,000 children younger than 5 years of 
        age, and 1 in 3 women in the developing world, suffer from 
        malnutrition, which leads to severe health and developmental 
        consequences.
            (7) Malnutrition can undermine future earning potential by 
        as much as 20 percent and can inhibit economic growth by as 
        much as 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). The African 
        Union Commission Cost of Hunger in Africa study estimated that 
        the economic costs associated with child undernutrition are 
        substantial, ranging from 2 percent to 16 percent of the gross 
        national product (GNP) in several African nations.
            (8) Research shows that adults who suffered from stunting 
        as children are less productive than nonstunted workers and are 
        less able to contribute to the economy. According to Save the 
        Children's 2013 Food for Thought report, if the current 
        malnutrition rates continue, global output could be reduced by 
        $125,000,000,000 by 2030, when the young children of today have 
        reached working age.
            (9) A comprehensive approach to endurable food security 
        should not only respond to emergency food shortages, but should 
        also address malnutrition, resilience against food and 
        nutrition insecurity due to disasters, building the capacity of 
        poor, rural populations to improve their agricultural 
        productivity, nutrition, and incomes, institutional impediments 
        to agricultural development, value chain access and efficiency, 
        agribusiness development, access to markets for the specific 
        needs and barriers facing women and small-scale producers, 
        education, and cooperative research.
            (10) An effective, sustainable approach to combating food 
        insecurity requires participation from multiple stakeholders, 
        including government, the private sector, international 
        organizations, local and nongovernmental stakeholders, 
        grassroots and civil society organizations, and higher 
        education research institutions.
            (11) Nongovernmental organizations, faith-based groups, 
        community-based organizations, and cooperatives can increase 
        the effectiveness of public investments by building local 
        capacity, strengthening food and nutrition security and 
        resilience, and leveraging additional resources.
            (12) The United States has provided consistent global 
        leadership in addressing food security and investing in 
        agricultural development and humanitarian assistance. In 2010, 
        the United States Government launched Feed the Future (FTF), an 
        initiative designed to expand and better coordinate the United 
        States investments in improving global food security. FTF is a 
        whole-of-government approach that works across agricultural 
        value chains and focuses on the dual objectives of improving 
        farmer productivity, income, and livelihoods in developing 
        countries and improving the nutrition of women and children.
            (13) The United States Government spearheaded the creation 
        of the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), 
        which mobilizes contributions from a wide range of 
        international donors to support the goals of FTF. Since 2010, 
        the GAFSP has leveraged approximately $730,000,000 from 10 
        donors and reached an estimated 12,000,000 direct beneficiaries 
        in 25 countries.

SEC. 3. POLICY OBJECTIVES; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Statement of Policy Objectives.--It is in the national security 
interest of the United States to promote global food and nutrition 
security, consistent with national agriculture investment plans, which 
is reinforced through programs, activities, and initiatives that--
            (1) eradicate hunger and malnutrition, especially for women 
        and children;
            (2) assist foreign countries to achieve long-term, 
        endurable, and inclusive agricultural development by 
        emphasizing--
                    (A) increased agricultural productivity, income, 
                and growth;
                    (B) reduction in poverty; and
                    (C) improved skills building and market linkages, 
                including for small-scale producers and women who face 
                specific constraints in accessing markets and 
                resources; and
            (3) ensure the effective use of United States taxpayer 
        dollars to further these objectives.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
Administrator, in providing assistance under this Act, should--
            (1) coordinate, through a whole-of-government approach, the 
        efforts of relevant Federal departments and agencies to 
        implement the strategy set forth in section 5(a);
            (2) utilize, to the extent possible, open and streamlined 
        solicitations to allow for the participation of a wide range of 
        implementing partners;
            (3) consider the provision of assistance through the most 
        appropriate contracting mechanism, whether it be grants, 
        cooperative agreements, or contracts, in order to best meet 
        objectives; and
            (4) continue to strengthen existing partnerships between 
        developing country institutions of agricultural sciences with 
        universities in the United States, with a focus on building the 
        capacities of developing nation universities in agriculture.
