                                 A BILL


 
To extend the Federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa 
              Indians of Montana, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa 
Indians Restoration Act of 2013''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians is a 
        political successor to signatories of the Pembina Treaty of 
        1863, under which a large area of land in the State of North 
        Dakota was ceded to the United States;
            (2) the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa of North Dakota 
        and the Chippewa-Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation of 
        Montana, which also are political successors to the signatories 
        of the Pembina Treaty of 1863, have been recognized by the 
        Federal Government as distinct Indian tribes;
            (3) the members of the Little Shell Tribe continue to live 
        in the State of Montana, as their ancestors have for more than 
        100 years since ceding land in the State of North Dakota as 
        described in paragraph (1);
            (4) in the 1930s and 1940s, the Tribe repeatedly petitioned 
        the Federal Government for reorganization under the Act of June 
        18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) (commonly known as the 
        ``Indian Reorganization Act'');
            (5) Federal agents who visited the Tribe and Commissioner 
        of Indian Affairs John Collier attested to the responsibility 
        of the Federal Government for the Tribe and members of the 
        Tribe, concluding that members of the Tribe are eligible for, 
        and should be provided with, trust land, making the Tribe 
        eligible for reorganization under the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 
        U.S.C. 461 et seq.) (commonly known as the ``Indian 
        Reorganization Act'');
            (6) due to a lack of Federal appropriations during the 
        Depression, the Bureau of Indian Affairs lacked adequate 
        financial resources to purchase land for the Tribe, and the 
        members of the Tribe were denied the opportunity to reorganize;
            (7) in spite of the failure of the Federal Government to 
        appropriate adequate funding to secure land for the Tribe as 
        required for reorganization under the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 
        U.S.C. 461 et seq.) (commonly known as the ``Indian 
        Reorganization Act''), the Tribe continued to exist as a 
        separate community, with leaders exhibiting clear political 
        authority;
            (8) the Tribe, together with the Turtle Mountain Band of 
        Chippewa of North Dakota and the Chippewa-Cree Tribe of the 
        Rocky Boy's Reservation of Montana, filed 2 law suits under the 
        Act of August 13, 1946 (60 Stat. 1049) (commonly known as the 
        ``Indian Claims Commission Act''), to petition for additional 
        compensation for land ceded to the United States under the 
        Pembina Treaty of 1863 and the McCumber Agreement of 1892;
            (9) in 1971 and 1982, pursuant to Acts of Congress, the 
        tribes received awards for the claims described in paragraph 
        (8);
            (10) in 1978, the Tribe submitted to the Bureau of Indian 
        Affairs a petition for Federal recognition, which is still 
        pending as of the date of enactment of this Act; and
            (11) the Federal Government, the State of Montana, and the 
        other federally recognized Indian tribes of the State have had 
        continuous dealings with the recognized political leaders of 
        the Tribe since the 1930s.
