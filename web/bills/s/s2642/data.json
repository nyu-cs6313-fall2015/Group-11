    "text": "Schedules That Work Act - Grants an employee the right to request that his or her employer change the terms and conditions of employment relating to:\n\n the number of hours or times the employee is required to work or be on call; the location; the amount of notification he or she receives of work schedule assignments; and minimizing fluctuations in the number of hours the employee is scheduled to work on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Requires the employer, if the request is made, to engage in a timely, good faith interactive process with the employee that includes a discussion of potential schedule changes that would meet his or her needs. Outlines the process for either granting or denying a change.\n\nRequires the employer to grant a request, unless there is a bona fide business reason for denying it, if the request is made because of the employee's serious health condition, his or her responsibilities as a caregiver, or enrollment in a career-related educational or training program, or if a part-time employee requests such a change for a reason related to a second job.\n\nAuthorizes an employer, if an employee requests a change for any other reason, to deny it for any reason that is not unlawful. Requires the employer to give the employee the reason for the denial, including whether it was a bona fide business reason.\n\nOutlines employer requirements for paying reporting time and split shift pay and for giving advance notice of work schedules to retail, food service, or cleaning employees, except for those in bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacities.\n\nMakes it unlawful for any employer or other person to: (1) interfere with, restrain, or deny the exercise or the attempt to exercise any right of an employee specified in this Act; (2) retaliate against an individual for exercising his or her rights, or (3) interfere with proceedings or inquiries with respect to violation of an individual's rights.\n\nSets forth administrative enforcement procedures and civil remedies for violation of these prohibitions.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Labor to give information and technical assistance to employers, labor organizations, and the general public concerning compliance with this Act.\n\nRequires the Comptroller General (GAO) to study the impact of certain difficult scheduling practices on employees and employers.\n\nMakes this Act inapplicable to any employee covered by a bona fide collective bargaining agreement if its terms govern work scheduling practices."
