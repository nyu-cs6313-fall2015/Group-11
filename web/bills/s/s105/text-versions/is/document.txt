SECTION 1. AUDIT OF HURRICANE PROTECTION FUNDING AND COST ESTIMATES.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 270 days after the date of

coordination with the National Academy of Engineering, shall conduct 
and submit to Congress a full audit of hurricane protection funding and 
cost estimates associated with post-Katrina hurricane protection.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the audit shall be--
            (1) to identify the causes for the extraordinary

        Katrina that were completed before the date of enactment of 
        this Act;
            (2) to conduct an analysis of resources available and work 
        required with respect to hurricane protection funding and post-
        Katrina hurricane protection; and
            (3) to identify strategies to replenish reprogrammed 
        funding from out-year work to immediate needs.
