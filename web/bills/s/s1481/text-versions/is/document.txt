To require issuers of long term care insurance to establish third-party

SEC. 2. LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE DISPUTE RESOLUTION REVIEW PROCESS.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an 
insurance issuer that offers a long term care insurance plan shall 
develop and implement claims dispute resolution procedures that comply 
with the requirements of this section that shall be applicable to such 
plan.
    (b) Requirement.--A claims dispute resolution procedure under 
subsection (a) shall--
            (1) be designed to expeditiously resolve disputes 
        concerning claims under the plan involved;
            (2) with respect to such disputes, provide for the 
        application of one or more alternative means of dispute 
        resolution involving independent third-party review under 
        appropriate circumstances by entities that are mutually 
        acceptable to the issuer and the enrollee involved, with the 
        decision of such reviewer being binding on the issuer; and
            (3) ensure that an enrollee is eligible to obtain claims 
        review only to the extent and in the manner provided for in the 
        applicable insurance contract.
    (c) Appeals.--An enrollee may appeal the decision of an independent 
reviewer under subsection (b)(2) to an appropriate State court as 
provided for under State law.
    (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to provide authority for an independent third-party reviewer 
under subsection (b)(2) to modify the terms of any long term care 
insurance contract.
