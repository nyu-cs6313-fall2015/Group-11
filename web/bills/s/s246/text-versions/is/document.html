SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON SALE OF GENETICALLY ALTERED SALMON.

    (a) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for a person--
            (1) to ship, transport, offer for sale, sell, or purchase a 
        covered fish, or a product containing covered fish, in

        or
            (4) to have custody, control, or possession of a covered

    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to a fish, fish

            (1) under confined use, or intended for confined use, for 
        scientific research;
            (2) collected for the purpose of enforcing this Act; or
            (3) if the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and 
        Atmosphere, in consultation with the Director of the U.S. Fish

        subsection (a), including any environmental assessment prepared 
        as part of that application, and--

                accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act

                    (B) finds the application to be consistent with an

                Secretary in accordance with section 102(2)(C) of the 
                National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 
                4332) that includes--
                            (i) an environmental risk analysis that 
                        assesses the potential direct and indirect 
                        impacts from escapement of covered fish on wild 
                        and cultured fish stocks and environments that 
                        may be exposed to such covered fish;
                            (ii) a failure mode and effects analysis 
                        that quantitatively assesses the best- and 
                        worst-case probabilities of failure of each 
                        applicable confinement technique;
                            (iii) an assessment of the costs of control 
                        or eradication of escaped covered fish; and
                            (iv) an assessment of the potential 
                        economic damage in terms of loss of production 
                        or sales to relevant wild and cultured fish 
                        stocks and environments from the escapement of 
                        covered fish.
    (c) Environmental Impact Considerations.--
            (1) Notice.--Each agency, department, or other unit of the 
        Federal government shall promptly notify the Under Secretary of 
        Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere when an action involving

        identified.
            (2) Ensuring compliance.--The Under Secretary of Commerce 
        for Oceans and Atmosphere, in cooperation with each Federal,

SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Confined use.--The term ``confined use'' means any 
        operation, undertaken within a secured, land-based facility, 
        that involves a covered fish controlled by specific measures 
        that effectively prevent the covered fish from having contact 
        with and impact on the external environment, including 
        biological and physical confinement measures.
            (2) Covered fish.--The term ``covered fish'' means a salmon 
        or other anadromous or marine fish, live or dead, including the 
        gametes, fertilized eggs, offspring, and descendants thereof, 
        that is modified or produced through the application of 
        recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technologies, using DNA 
        from an organism's own genome or that of another species, which 
        overcome natural physiological reproductive barriers and which 
        are not techniques used in traditional breeding and selection.
            (3) Finding of no significant impact.--The term ``finding 
        of no significant impact'' has the meaning given the term in 
        section 1508.13 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations.
