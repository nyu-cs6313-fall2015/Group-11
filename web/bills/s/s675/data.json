Requires written notification of the identification of a covered person or entity to the head of an executive agency or the commander of a covered command, who shall then notify the heads of contracting activities or other appropriate officials.\n\nRequires the revision of applicable procurement regulations to: (1) authorize the head of contracting activity of an executive agency, upon receiving notice of a covered person or entity, to restrict, terminate, or void the award of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements that would provide funds to such covered person or entity; (2) require the inclusion of a clause in each covered contract, grant, or cooperative agreement requiring the recipient of funds to exercise due diligence to ensure that funds are not provided to a covered person or entity; and (3) require written notification to a contractor or recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement\u00a0of an action to restrict, terminate, or void a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement and permit such contractor or recipient to challenge such action by requesting an administrative review. Defines \"covered contract, grant, or cooperative agreement\" as a contract, grant, or cooperative agreement with an estimated value in excess of $50,000 that is performed outside the United States.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Defense to review annually the lists of previously identified covered persons and entities to determine whether such persons or entities warrant further identification as such.\n\nRequires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), not later than March 1 of 2016, 2017, and 2018, to submit to specified congressional committees a report on the use of authority under this Act to identify covered persons or entities.\n\nProvides that nothing in this Act shall apply to the authorized intelligence or law enforcement activities of the U.S. government.\n\nTerminates the provisions of this section on December 31, 2019.\n\n(Sec. 3) Requires the revision of applicable procurement regulations to allow for inclusion of a clause in each covered contract, grant, and cooperative agreement authorizing an executive agency head to examine any records of the recipient upon a written determination that funds under the contract, grant, or cooperative agreement have been provided to a covered person or entity.\n\nRequires the OMB Director, not later than March 1 of 2016, 2017, and 2018, to submit a report on the use of such authority to examine records in the preceding calendar year."
