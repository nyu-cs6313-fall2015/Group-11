            ``An individual is the `widow' or `widower' of an author if 
        the courts of the State in which the individual and the author 
        were married (or, if the individual and the author were not 
        married in any State but were validly married in another 
        jurisdiction, the courts of any State) would find that the 
        individual and the author were validly married at the time of 
        the author's death, whether or not the spouse has later 
        remarried.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to the death of any author that occurs on or after
