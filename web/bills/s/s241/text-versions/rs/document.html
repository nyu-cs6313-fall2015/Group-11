        the management plan, the Secretary shall consider the 
        recommendations of Indian tribes and pueblos on methods for--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;

existing rights, the wilderness areas designated by subsection (a) 
shall be administered in accordance with the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 
1131 et seq.) and this Act, except that with respect to the wilderness 
areas designated by this Act--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) any reference to the effective date of the 
        Wilderness Act shall be considered to be a reference to the 
        date of enactment of this Act; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) any reference in the Wilderness Act to the 
        Secretary of Agriculture shall be considered to be a reference 
        to the Secretary.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Incorporation of Acquired Land and Interests in 
Land.--Any land or interest in land within the boundary of the 
wilderness areas designated by subsection (a) that is acquired by the 
United States shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) become part of the wilderness area in which 
        the land is located; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) be managed in accordance with--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et 
                seq.);&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) this Act; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) any other applicable laws.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Grazing.--Grazing of livestock in the wilderness areas 
designated by subsection (a), where established before the date of 
enactment of this Act, shall be administered in accordance with--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) section 4(d)(4) of the Wilderness Act (16 
        U.S.C. 1133(d)(4)); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        that an activity or use on land outside any wilderness area 
        designated by subsection (a) can be seen or heard within the 
        wilderness area shall not preclude the activity or use outside 
        the boundary of the wilderness area.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (f) Release of Wilderness Study Areas.--Congress finds 
that, for purposes of section 603(c) of the Federal Land Policy and
