                custody or control of a property determines that there 
                is an identified notice of interest in the property for 
                a certified use under subparagraph (B), as soon as 
                practicable after the date on which the recommendations 
                of the Commission are required to be implemented by 
                Federal agencies under section 8(i), the Federal agency

                                property to the party.
            (9) Other options for use of property.--If, after the date 
        on which the recommendations of the Commission are required to 
        be implemented by Federal agencies under section 8(i), a 
        property does not qualify, or there is no interest in a 
        property reviewed, for 1 of the uses described in subsection 
        (a), a Federal agency may select among any other remaining ways 
        to implement the recommendations of the Commission with respect
