Provides for: (1) the suspension from the federal procurement process of a person who certifies that he or she has such a debt, and (2) debarment of a person whose certification that he or she does not have such a debt is demonstrated to be false.\n\nDefines \"seriously delinquent tax debt\" as an outstanding tax debt for which a notice of lien has been filed in public records. Exempts from such definition: (1) tax debts that are being paid in a timely manner under an approved installment agreement, and (2) debts for which a collection due process hearing has been requested or is pending."
