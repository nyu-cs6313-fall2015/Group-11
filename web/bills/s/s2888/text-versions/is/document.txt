                                 A BILL


 
  To promote the provision of exercise and fitness equipment that is 
              accessible to individuals with disabilities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Exercise and Fitness For All Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Individuals with disabilities can maintain and improve 
        their health through appropriate physical activity.
            (2) In the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans 
        (referred to as the ``Guidelines''), the Department of Health 
        and Human Services recommends that individuals with 
        disabilities, who are able, participate in regular aerobic 
        activity.
            (3) The Guidelines also recommend that adults with 
        disabilities, who are able, do muscle-strengthening activities 
        of moderate or high intensity on 2 or more days a week, as 
        these activities provide additional health benefits.
            (4) The Guidelines recommend that when adults with 
        disabilities are not able to meet the Guidelines, they should 
        engage in regular physical activity according to their 
        abilities and avoid inactivity.
            (5) Unfortunately, many individuals with disabilities are 
        unable to engage in the recommended exercise or fitness 
        activities due to the inaccessibility of exercise or fitness 
        equipment.
            (6) Physical inactivity by adults with disabilities can 
        lead to increased risk for functional limitations and secondary 
        health conditions.
    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to encourage exercise and fitness service providers to 
        provide accessible exercise and fitness equipment for 
        individuals with disabilities; and
            (2) to provide guidance about the requirements necessary to 
        ensure that such exercise and fitness equipment is accessible 
        to, and usable by, individuals with disabilities.
