To strengthen our Nation's electoral system by ensuring clean and fair 
                               elections.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Clean and Fair Elections Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.

    It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should--
            (1) recognize that--
                    (A) our elections belong to the voters of the 
                United States; and
                    (B) our systems of election administration and 
                campaign finance should be structured in a way that 
                prioritizes the interests of the American public first;
            (2) pass legislation to bring greater transparency to our 
        elections and end anonymous political spending by shadow groups 
        and special interests;
            (3) require greater disclosure of campaign contributions in 
        a searchable, public online database;
            (4) take steps to safeguard the right to vote for every 
        eligible voter, including prohibiting deceptive and misleading 
        efforts to prevent voters from exercising the franchise;
            (5) improve access to the polls for every eligible voter by 
        streamlining voting procedures;
            (6) pass election reform legislation that includes expanded 
        absentee voting, mandatory early voting periods, and voter 
        registration reforms;
            (7) support local election officials to ensure they have 
        working voting systems that are accessible, secure, and easy to 
        use;
            (8) require States to develop plans to reduce lines at 
        polling places and develop contingency plans that provide 
        additional flexibility in the event of a natural disaster or 
        other emergency situation; and
            (9) ensure that the guarantees of the 14th and 15th 
        amendments to the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 
        1965 are enforced so that all Americans are able to vote and 
        have their votes count without discrimination.
