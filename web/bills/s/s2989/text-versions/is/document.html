        plans;
            (5) the views and participation of a broad range of 
        stakeholders in the development and implementation of regional 
        energy strategies and plans is needed for success; and
            (6) the Federal Government, in the role of a long-term 
        strategic energy partner, can effectively--
                    (A) establish strategic alliances with States;
