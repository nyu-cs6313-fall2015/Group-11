                                 A BILL


 
  A bill to expand the number of scholarships available to Pakistani 
       women under the Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Malala Yousafzai 
Scholarship Act'''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) On October 9, 2012, 15-year-old Malala 
        Yousafzai was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in Pakistan on 
        her way home from school.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) When Malala was 11 years old, she bravely 
        stood up to the Taliban and wrote a secret blog documenting 
        their crackdown on women's rights and education in 
        2009.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Malala's advocacy for women's education made 
        her a target of the Taliban.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) The Taliban called Malala's efforts to 
        highlight the need for women's education an 
        ``obscenity''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) According to the United Nation's 2012 
        Education for All Global Monitoring Report, ``Pakistan has the 
        second largest number of children out of school [in the 
        world]'' and ``nearly half of rural females have never been to 
        school.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) According to a Council on Foreign Relations 
        report titled ``What Works in Girls' Education'', ``A 100-
        country study by the World Bank shows that increasing the share 
        of women with a secondary education by 1 percent boosts annual 
        per capita income growth by 0.3 percentage points.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) According to the World Bank, ``The benefits of 
        women's education go beyond higher productivity for 50 percent 
        of the population. More educated women also tend to be 
        healthier, participate more in the formal labor market, earn 
        more income, have fewer children, and provide better health 
        care and education to their children, all of which eventually 
        improve the well-being of all individuals and lift households 
        out of poverty. These benefits also transmit across 
        generations, as well as to their communities at 
        large.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) According to United Nation's 2012 Education 
        For All Global Monitoring Report, ``education can make a big 
        difference to women's earnings. In Pakistan, women with a high 
        level of literacy earned 95 percent more than women with no 
        literacy skills.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) In January 2010, Secretary of State Hillary 
        Rodham Clinton stated, ``We will open the doors of education to 
        all citizens, but especially to girls and women . . . We are 
        doing all of these things because we have seen that when women 
        and girls have the tools to stay healthy and the opportunity to 
        contribute to their families' well-being, they flourish and so 
        do the people around them.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) The United States provides critical foreign 
        assistance to Pakistan's education sector to improve access to 
        and the quality of basic and higher education.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) The Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program 
        administered by the United States Agency for International 
        Development awards scholarships to academically talented, 
        financially needy Pakistani students from remote regions of the 
        country to pursue bachelor's or master's degrees at 
        participating Pakistani universities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (12) Twenty-five percent of the 1,807 Merit and 
        Needs-Based Scholarships awarded to date have been for women, 
        with the goal of awarding 50 percent of the scholarships for 
        fall 2013 matriculation to women.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (13) The United Nations declared November 10 as 
        ``Malala Day''--a global day of support for and recognition of 
        Malala's bravery and courage in promoting women's 
        education.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (14) On December 10, 2012, the United Nations and 
        the Government of Pakistan launched the ``Malala Fund for 
        Girls' Education'' to improve girls' access to education 
        worldwide, with Pakistan donating the first $10,000,000 to the 
        Fund.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (15) The Government of Pakistan has stated that it 
        plans to open 16 schools for poor children in areas affected by 
        conflict or natural disasters and name them ``Malala Schools'' 
        after Malala Yousafzai.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (16) The Government of Pakistan, the United 
        Nations, the World Bank, and other international organizations 
        have set an April 2013 deadline to put forward a plan to 
        provide education for all of Pakistan's school-aged children by 
        the end of 2015.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (17) More than 1,000,000 people around the world 
        have signed the United Nations Special Envoy for Global 
        Education petition calling on the Government of Pakistan to 
        enroll every boy and girl in primary school.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (18) Pakistani civil society organizations 
        collected an additional 1,200,000 signatures from Pakistanis on 
        a petition dedicated to Malala's cause.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        fundamental human rights; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) educational exchanges increase people-to-
        people ties and promote institutional linkages between the 
        United States and other countries.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Continued Support for Educational Initiatives in 
Pakistan.--Congress encourages the Department of State and the United 
States Agency for International Development to continue their support 
for initiatives led by the Government of Pakistan and Pakistani civil 
society that promote education in Pakistan, especially education for 
women.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Academic disciplines.--Additional scholarships 
        added by subsection (a) shall be awarded for a range of 
        disciplines to improve the employability of graduates and to

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Other scholarships.--The USAID Administrator 
        shall make every effort to award 50 percent of the scholarships 
        available under the Program (excluding the additional

        women.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 5. ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--The USAID Administrator shall designate 
appropriate USAID officials to brief the appropriate congressional

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Malala Yousafzai Scholarship Act'''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On October 9, 2012, 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai was 
        shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in Pakistan on her way home 
        from school.
            (2) When Malala was 11 years old, she bravely stood up to 
        the Taliban and wrote a secret blog documenting their crackdown 
        on women's rights and education in 2009.
            (3) Malala's advocacy for women's education made her a 
        target of the Taliban.
            (4) The Taliban called Malala's efforts to highlight the 
        need for women's education an ``obscenity''.
            (5) On July 12, 2013, Malala celebrated her 16th birthday 
        by delivering a speech before the United Nations General 
        Assembly in which she said, ``So let us wage a glorious 
        struggle against illiteracy, poverty, and terrorism. Let us 
        pick up our books and our pens. They are the most powerful 
        weapons. One child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can 
        change the world. Education is the only solution.''.
            (6) According to the United Nation's 2012 Education for All 
        Global Monitoring Report, ``Pakistan has the second largest 
        number of children out of school [in the world]'' and ``nearly 
        half of rural females have never been to school.''.
            (7) According to a Council on Foreign Relations report 
        titled ``What Works in Girls' Education'', ``A 100-country 
        study by the World Bank shows that increasing the share of 
        women with a secondary education by 1 percent boosts annual per 
        capita income growth by 0.3 percentage points.''.
            (8) According to the World Bank, ``The benefits of women's 
        education go beyond higher productivity for 50 percent of the 
        population. More educated women also tend to be healthier, 
        participate more in the formal labor market, earn more income, 
        have fewer children, and provide better health care and 
        education to their children, all of which eventually improve 
        the well-being of all individuals and lift households out of 
        poverty. These benefits also transmit across generations, as 
        well as to their communities at large.''.
            (9) According to United Nation's 2012 Education For All 
        Global Monitoring Report, ``education can make a big difference 
        to women's earnings. In Pakistan, women with a high level of 
        literacy earned 95 percent more than women with no literacy 
        skills.''.
            (10) In January 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham 
        Clinton stated, ``We will open the doors of education to all 
        citizens, but especially to girls and women...We are doing all 
        of these things because we have seen that when women and girls 
        have the tools to stay healthy and the opportunity to 
        contribute to their families' well-being, they flourish and so 
        do the people around them.''.
            (11) The United States provides critical foreign assistance 
        to Pakistan's education sector to improve access to and the 
        quality of basic and higher education.
            (12) The Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program 
        administered by the United States Agency for International 
        Development awards scholarships to academically talented, 
        financially needy Pakistani students from remote regions of the 
        country to pursue bachelor's or master's degrees at 
        participating Pakistani universities.
            (13) Fifty percent of the 974 Merit and Needs-Based 
        Scholarships awarded during fiscal year 2013 were awarded to 
        Pakistani women. Historically, only 25 percent of such 
        scholarships have been awarded to women.
            (14) The United Nations declared July 12 as ``Malala 
        Day''--a global day of support for and recognition of Malala's 
        bravery and courage in promoting women's education.
            (15) On December 10, 2012, the United Nations and the 
        Government of Pakistan launched the ``Malala Fund for Girls' 
        Education'' to improve girls' access to education worldwide, 
        with Pakistan donating the first $10,000,000 to the Fund.
            (16) More than 1,000,000 people around the world have 
        signed the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education 
        petition calling on the Government of Pakistan to enroll every 
        boy and girl in primary school.
            (17) Pakistani civil society organizations collected almost 
        2,000,000 signatures from Pakistanis on a petition dedicated to 
        Malala's cause of education for all.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) every individual should have the opportunity to pursue 
        an education;
            (2) every individual, regardless of gender, should have the 
        opportunity to pursue an education without fear of 
        discrimination; and
            (3) educational exchanges increase people-to-people ties 
        and promote institutional linkages between the United States 
        and other countries.
    (b) Continued Support for Educational Initiatives in Pakistan.--The 
Senate encourages the Department of State and the United States Agency 
for International Development to continue their support for initiatives 
led by the Government of Pakistan and Pakistani civil society that 
promote education in Pakistan, especially education for women.
