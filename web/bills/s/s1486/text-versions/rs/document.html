        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--If the Postal Service intends to 
        establish a change in delivery schedule under subsection (a), 
        the Postal Service, to the extent practicable and appropriate, 
        shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) identify customers and communities for 
                which the change may have a disproportionate, negative 
                impact, including small business customers and the 
                customers identified as ``particularly affected'' in 
                the Advisory Opinion on Elimination of Saturday 
                Delivery issued by the Commission on March 24, 
                2011;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) develop measures to ameliorate any 
                disproportionately negative impact the change would 
                have on customers and communities identified under 
                paragraph (1); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) not later than 3 months before the 
                effective date for any proposed change, submit a report 
                that includes the determination required under 
                subsection (a)(1) and details any measures developed 
                pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph to--
                &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) the Committee on Homeland

                        Senate;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) the Committee on Oversight

        satisfied.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) GAO Report.--Not later than 270 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States 
shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform of the House of Representatives a report evaluating the extent 
to which a change in delivery schedule would improve the financial 
condition of the Postal Service and assist in the efforts of the Postal 
Service to achieve long-term solvency, taking into consideration other 
ongoing and planned efforts to increase revenue and reduce costs, 
consistent with the requirements of this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
be construed to--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) require the decrease or increase in delivery 
        frequency for any route for which the Postal Service provided 
        delivery on fewer than 6 days per week as of the date of 
        enactment of this Act;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) authorize any change in--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the days and times that postal retail 
                service or any mail acceptance is available at postal 
                retail facilities or processing facilities;

        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) prohibit the Postal Service from exercising 
        its authority to make changes to processing or retail 
        networks.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Packages.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, for a period of not less than 2 years, beginning on the date

general, nationwide delivery schedule of 5 or fewer days per week 
consistent with the provisions of this section, the Postal Service 
shall amend the Mailing Standards of the United States, Domestic Mail 
Manual to ensure that the provisions of section 508.3.2.10 of such 
manual, as in effect on January 1, 2013, shall apply on any day on 
which the Postal Service does not deliver the mail under the 
established delivery schedule.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

section, including paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection (c), it shall

                months after the date of enactment of the Postal Reform 
                Act of 2013, the head of each district office of the

                within the district office's service area that are 
                appropriate candidates for conversion from door

                accordance with standards established by the Postal 
                Service.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                basis, the addresses identified under subparagraph (A) 
                from door delivery to a more cost-effective primary

                        from postal customers, State and local 
                        governments, local associations, and property

                        points in locations that maximize delivery 
                        efficiency, ease of use for postal customers,

        under paragraph (2) or (3), the Postal Service may provide door

                efficient provision of centralized delivery or curbside

                effective, or would not be in the best long-term 
                interest of the Postal Service.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(5) Waiver for physical hardship.--The Postal 
        Service shall establish and maintain a waiver program under

        may be continued or provided to a delivery point if--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    ``(A) centralized delivery or curbside

Postal Service shall establish, and may from time to time thereafter

consistent with the requirements of this section. The authority under 
this section may not be delegated to the Postmaster General or to any

        magnitude within, between, or among classes of mail.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        3633.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        during any period of 4 consecutive quarters, after the first 
        quarter of the period described in subsection (a)(1)(B), 
        exceeds 140,000,000,000 pieces shall not affect the continued 
        authority of the Postal Service to establish or maintain a 
        nationwide delivery schedule of 5 days per week.
            (3) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of

        may have a disproportionate, negative impact, including small 
        business customers, the elderly, those who live in locations 
        without access to broadband Internet service, and the customers 
        identified as ``particularly affected'' in the Advisory Opinion 
        on Elimination of Saturday Delivery issued by the Commission on 
        March 24, 2011;
            (2) develop measures to ameliorate any disproportionately 
        negative impact the change would have on customers and 
        communities identified under paragraph (1);
            (3) implement measures to increase revenue and reduce 
        costs, including the measures authorized under this Act and the 
        amendments made by this Act;
            (4) evaluate whether any increase in revenue or reduction 
        in costs, or anticipated increase in revenue or reduction in 
        costs, resulting from the measures implemented under paragraph 
        (3) are sufficient to allow the Postal Service, without 
        implementing a change in delivery schedule under subsection 
        (a), to achieve long-term solvency; and
            (5) not earlier than 2 years and not later than 6 months 
        before the effective date for any proposed change, submit a 
        report that includes the determination required under

Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Oversight and 
Government Reform of the House of Representatives a report evaluating 
the extent to which--
            (1) a change in delivery schedule would improve the 
        financial condition of the Postal Service and assist in the 
        efforts of the Postal Service to achieve long-term solvency, 
        taking into consideration other ongoing and planned efforts to 
        increase revenue and reduce costs, consistent with the 
        requirements under this Act; and
            (2) the Postal Service has complied with each of the 
        requirements under subsection (b).

        the report if the report includes a finding by the Comptroller 
        General that--
                    (A) the proposed change in delivery schedule would 
                not substantially improve the financial condition of 
                the Postal Service and assist in the efforts of the 
                Postal Service to achieve long-term solvency; or
                    (B) the Postal Service has not complied with each

        schedule.--The Postal Service may not implement a change in 
        delivery schedule under subsection (a) until 60 days after the 
        date on which the Postal Service submits the response required

        dominant products (referred to in this section as the 
        `system'), consistent with the requirements under this section.

        not be delegated to the Postmaster General or to any other 
        individual or entity.

following objectives, each of which shall be applied in conjunction 
with the others:

        reduce costs and increase efficiency.
