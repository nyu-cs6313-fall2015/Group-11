_______________________________________________________________________


                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

           September 17 (legislative day, September 16), 2014

Ms. Cantwell (for herself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Portman, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. 
    Blunt, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Leahy) introduced the 
 following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on 
                                Finance

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To provide for duty-free treatment of certain recreational performance 
                   outerwear, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States Optimal Use of Trade 
to Develop Outerwear and Outdoor Recreation Act'' or the ``U.S. OUTDOOR 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The outdoor industry generates $646,000,000,000 in 
        consumer spending annually and directly supports 6,000,000 
        jobs.
            (2) Outdoor activities are vitally important to the health 
        and well-being of the people of the United States.
            (3) Duty rates on recreational performance apparel are 
        among the highest duty rates imposed by the United States 
        Government, with duties on some recreational performance 
        apparel as high as 28.2 percent.
            (4) The duties currently imposed by the United States on 
        recreational performance apparel were set in an era during 
        which high rates of duty were intended to protect the 
        production of other apparel in the United States, and before 
        the technologies and innovations that create today's 
        recreational performance apparel industry were developed.
            (5) In July 2007, the United States International Trade 
        Commission confirmed, in USITC Publication 3937, that 
        recreational performance apparel produced in the United States 
        makes up less than 1 percent of the total recreational 
        performance apparel market.
            (6) The elimination of duties on the importation of certain 
        recreational performance apparel would provide an economic 
        benefit to United States consumers of outdoor products and 
        would promote increased participation in healthy and active 
        lifestyles.

SEC. 3. KNIT APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES.

    (a) Definitions.--The Additional U.S. Note to chapter 61 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended--
            (1) in the heading, by striking ``Additional U.S. Note'' 
        and inserting ``Additional U.S. Notes''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new notes:
    ``2. (a) For purposes of this chapter, the term `recreational

        design, or patterning to allow radial arm movement.
            ``(xi) Odor control technology.
The term `recreational performance outerwear' does not include 
occupational outerwear or garments with an outer surface of looped 
pile.
    ``(b) For purposes of this Note, the following terms have the 
following meanings:
            ``(i) The term `water resistant' means that a garment must 
        have a water resistance (see ASTM designations D 3779-81 and D 
        3781-79) such that, under a head pressure of 600 millimeters, 
        not more than 1.0 gram of water penetrates after two minutes 
        when tested in accordance with the current version of AATCC 
        Test Method 35. The water resistance of the garment is the 
        result of a rubber or plastics application to the outer shell, 
        lining, or inner lining.
            ``(ii) The term `treated with plastics' refers to textile 
        fabrics impregnated, coated, covered, or laminated with 
        plastics, as described in Note 2 to chapter 59.
            ``(iii) The term `sealed seams' means seams that have been 
        covered by means of taping, gluing, bonding, cementing, fusing, 
        welding, or a similar process so that water cannot pass through 
        the seams when tested in accordance with the current version of 
        AATCC Test Method 35.
            ``(iv) The term `critically sealed seams' means--
                    ``(A) for jackets, windbreakers, and similar 
                articles (including padded, sleeveless jackets), sealed 
                seams that are sealed at the front and back yokes, or 
                at the shoulders, arm holes, or both, where applicable; 
                and
                    ``(B) for trousers, overalls and bib overalls and 
                similar articles, sealed seams that are sealed at the 
                front (up to the zipper or other means of closure) and 
                back rise.
            ``(v) The term `insulation for cold weather protection' 
        means insulation with either synthetic fill, down, a laminated 
        thermal backing, or other lining for thermal protection from 
        cold weather.
            ``(vi) The term `venting' refers to closeable or permanent 
        constructed openings in a garment (excluding front, primary 
        zipper closures and grommet(s)) to allow increased expulsion of 
        built-up heat during outdoor activities. In a jacket, such 
        openings are often positioned on the underarm seam of a garment 
        but may also be placed along other seams in the front or back 
        of a garment. In trousers, such openings are often positioned 
        on the inner or outer leg seams of a garment but may also be 
        placed along other seams in the front or back of a garment.
            ``(vii) The term `articulated elbows or knees' refers to 
        the construction of a sleeve (or pant leg) to allow improved 
        mobility at the elbow (or knee) through the use of extra seams, 
        darts, gussets, or other means.
            ``(viii) The term `reinforcement' refers to the use of a 
        double layer of fabric or section(s) of fabric that is 
        abrasion-resistant or otherwise more durable than the face 
        fabric of the garment.
            ``(ix) The term `weatherproof closure' means a closure 
        (including, but not limited to, laminated or coated zippers, 
        storm flaps, or other weatherproof construction) that has been 
        reinforced or engineered in a manner to reduce the penetration 
        or absorption of moisture or air through an opening in the 
        garment.
            ``(x) The term `multi-adjustable hood or adjustable collar' 
        means, in the case of a hood, a hood into which is incorporated 
        two or more draw cords, adjustment tabs, or elastics, or, in 
        the case of a collar, a collar into which is incorporated at 
        least one draw cord, adjustment tab, elastic, or similar 
        component, to allow volume adjustments around a helmet, or the 
        crown of the head, neck, or face.
            ``(xi) The terms `adjustable powder skirt' and `inner 
        protective skirt' refer to a partial lower inner lining with 
        means of tightening around the waist for additional protection 
        from the elements.
            ``(xii) The term `arm gusset' means construction at the arm 
        of a gusset that utilizes an extra fabric piece in the 
        underarm, usually diamond- or triangular-shaped, designed, or 
        patterned to allow radial arm movement.
            ``(xiii) The term `radial arm movement' refers to 
        unrestricted, 180-degree range of motion for the arm while 
        wearing performance outerwear.
            ``(xiv) The term `odor control technology' means the 
        incorporation into a fabric or garment of materials, including, 
        but not limited to, activated carbon, silver, copper, or any 
        combination thereof, capable of adsorbing, absorbing, or 
        reacting with human odors, or effective in reducing the growth 
        of odor-causing bacteria.
            ``(xv) The term `occupational outerwear' means outerwear 
        garments, including uniforms, designed or marketed for use in 
        the workplace or at a worksite to provide durable protection 
        from cold or inclement weather and/or workplace hazards, such 
        as fire, electrical, abrasion, or chemical hazards, or impacts, 
        cuts, punctures, or similar hazards.
    ``3. For purposes of this chapter, the importer of record shall 
maintain internal import records that specify upon entry whether 
garments claimed as recreational performance outerwear have an outer 
surface that is water resistant, treated with plastics, or a 
combination thereof, and shall further enumerate the specific features 
that make the garments eligible to be classified as recreational 
performance outerwear.''.

        as fire, electrical, abrasion, or chemical hazards, or impacts, 
        cuts, punctures, or similar hazards.
    ``(c) For purposes of this chapter, the importer of record shall 
maintain internal import records that specify upon entry whether 
garments claimed as recreational performance outerwear have an outer 
surface that is water resistant, treated with plastics, or a 
combination thereof, and shall further enumerate the specific features 
that make the garments eligible to be classified as recreational 
performance outerwear.''.
