To improve the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to study the 
         use of antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Antimicrobial Data Collection Act''.

SEC. 2. RESEARCH PROGRAMS TO STUDY ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE.

    (a) Definitions.--In this Act--
            (1) the term ``Commissioner'' means the Commissioner of 
        Food and Drugs; and
            (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health 
        and Human Services.
    (b) Commencement of Pilot Data Collection and Analysis Program.--
The Secretary, acting through the Commissioner, shall develop a 
research program or programs to study the relationship between the 
sales, distribution, end-use practices of animal drugs containing an 
antimicrobial active ingredient in food-producing animals and 
antimicrobial resistance trends. The Secretary may also consider any 
other available sound information, science, research, expertise, or 
program designs in carrying out this subsection.
    (c) Purpose of Programs.--Any research program developed under 
subsection (b) shall be developed in order to better determine--
            (1) the relationships between sales data, distribution 
        data, and end-usage data of animal drugs containing an 
        antimicrobial active ingredient in food-producing animals to 
        inform policies of Food and Drug Administration regarding data 
        collection and regulation of antimicrobial products in 
        agriculture, including consideration of the potential value and 
        feasibility of data from veterinary feed directives and other 
        sources; and
            (2) the relationships between the use of animal drugs 
        containing an antimicrobial active ingredient in food-producing 
        animals and trends in antimicrobial resistance, including by 
        using the data collected through the National Antimicrobial 
        Resistance Monitoring System or other studies regarding 
        resistance levels in bacteria associated with food-producing 
        animals.
    (d) Consultation.--Any research program developed under subsection 
(b) shall be developed in consultation with the Secretary of 
Agriculture, which shall include at a minimum consultation with the 
Under Secretary for Food Safety, the Under Secretary for Marketing and 
Regulatory Programs, and the Under Secretary for Research, Education, 
and Economics at the Department of Agriculture. To the extent 
practicable, such Under Secretaries shall provide assistance in 
developing and conducting such research programs.
    (e) Implementation.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall implement the research 
program or programs developed under subsection (b). The Secretary shall 
analyze data from such program or programs to determine the 
contribution of such data to studying antimicrobial resistance and 
establishing the antimicrobial data collection strategy as described in 
section 3(b)(1)(B).

SEC. 3. REPORTS TO CONGRESS; DEVELOPMENT OF DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY.

    (a) Initial Report.--As soon as practicable after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall--
            (1) submit to Congress a report that--
                    (A) describes the research design and goals for the 
                research program or programs developed under section 
                2(b); and
                    (B) includes a needs assessment, considering broad 
                sources of data and models on antimicrobial use in 
                food-producing animals that the Food and Drug 
                Administration may need or from which the Food and Drug 
                Administration could benefit, to improve the evaluation 
                of Food and Drug Administration programs regarding 
                antimicrobial resistance and how a systematic and valid 
                data collection strategy will be designed to comply 
                with subsection (b)(1)(B); and
            (2) make such report publicly available.
    (b) Report Regarding Results and Recommendations.--Not later than 2

                research program or programs developed under section 
                2(b), including with respect to the determinations made 
                pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 2(c); and
                    (B) provides recommendations for developing an 
                antimicrobial data collection strategy based on the 
                information contained in the comments to the Advanced 
                Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled ``Antimicrobial 
                Animal Drug Distribution Reporting'' (77 Fed. Reg.
