        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) Modification.--Subject to the requirements of 
        this Act and approval by the Secretary, the Klamath Tribes may

                purchased with disbursements from the Fund shall revert

                agreement shall specify that if assurances made do not 
                become permanent as described in section 15.3.3 of the 
                Restoration Agreement and on publication of a notice by 
                the Secretary pursuant to section 15.3.4.C of the 
                Restoration Agreement or section 10.2 of the Upper 
                Basin Agreement, any amounts disbursed from the Fund 
                shall be repaid to the United States, without interest, 
                in annual installments over a period not to exceed 40 
                years.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
