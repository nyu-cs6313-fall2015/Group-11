                    (B) Effect.--Nothing in this paragraph precludes 
                the Secretary from carrying out authorized forest and

                    (B) on signing of a decision document for the 
                authorized forest and watershed restoration project, 
                the Secretary shall implement the authorized forest and 
                watershed restoration project;
                    (C) the predecisional objection process promulgated 
                under part 218 of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations 
                (and successor regulations), shall apply; and
                    (D) if the Secretary or a court determines that 
                additional review is warranted due to significant new 
                circumstances after implementation of an authorized 
                forest and watershed restoration project has begun, the 
                additional analysis shall not interrupt the

        an aquatic and riparian habitat protection strategy to modify 
        the aquatic and riparian conservation requirements in existing

        the best available science, that the modifications would meet 
        or exceed the aquatic and riparian protection requirements in 
        the existing forest plans.
            (2) Roads.--In carrying out any authorized forest and 
        watershed restoration project under this title, the Secretary 
        shall--

                            (i) the Secretary determines that the road 
                        is a justifiable realignment of a permanent 
                        road to restore or improve the ecological 
                        structure, composition, and function and the 
                        natural processes of the affected forest or 
                        watershed; and

                unauthorized roads--
                            (i) subject to appropriations; and
                            (ii) consistent with the analysis required 
                        by subparts A and B of part 212 of title 36, 
                        Code of Federal Regulations.
