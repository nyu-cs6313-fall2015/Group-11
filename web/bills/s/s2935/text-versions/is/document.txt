                                 A BILL


 
 To provide for programs and activities with respect to the prevention 
                         of underage drinking.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sober Truth on Preventing Underage 
Drinking Reauthorization Act'' or the ``STOP Act''.

SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.

    Section 519B of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-25b) 
is amended by striking subsections (a) through (f) and inserting the 
following:
    ``(a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:
            ``(1) The term `alcohol beverage industry' means the 
        brewers, vintners, distillers, importers, distributors, and 
        retail and online outlets that sell or serve beer, wine, or 
        distilled spirits.
            ``(2) The term `school-based prevention' means programs 
        that are institutionalized and run by staff members or school-
        designated persons or organizations in any grade of school, 
        kindergarten through 12th grade.
            ``(3) The term `youth' means persons under the age of 21.
    ``(b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that:
            ``(1) A multi-faceted effort is needed to more successfully 
        address the problem of underage drinking in the United States. 
        A coordinated approach to prevention, intervention, treatment, 
        enforcement, and research is key to making progress. This 
        section recognizes the need for a focused national effort, and 
        addresses particulars of the Federal portion of that effort, as 
        well as Federal support for State activities.
            ``(2) The Secretary should continue to conduct research and 
        collect data on the short and long-range impact of alcohol use 
        and abuse upon adolescent brain development and other organ 
        systems.
            ``(3) States and communities, including colleges and 
        universities, are encouraged to adopt comprehensive approaches 
        to preventing alcohol abuse, including--
                    ``(A) evidence-based screening, programs, and 
                curricula;
                    ``(B) brief intervention strategies;
                    ``(C) consistent policy enforcement; and
                    ``(D) science-based strategies to reduce underage 
                drinking.
            ``(4) Public health groups, consumer groups, and the 
        alcohol beverage industry should continue and expand evidence-
        based efforts to prevent and reduce underage drinking.
            ``(5) The entertainment industries have a powerful impact 
        on youth and should use rating systems and marketing codes to 
        reduce the likelihood that underage audiences will be exposed 
        to movies, recordings, television programs, or other digital 
        media with unsuitable alcohol content.
            ``(6) The National Collegiate Athletic Association, its 
        member colleges and universities, and athletic conferences 
        should affirm a commitment to a policy of discouraging alcohol 
        use among underage students and other young fans.
            ``(7) Alcohol is a unique product and should be regulated 
        differently than other products by the States and Federal 
        Government. States have primary authority to regulate alcohol 
        distribution and sale, and the Federal Government should 
        support and supplement these State efforts. States also have a 
        responsibility to fight youth access to alcohol and reduce 
        underage drinking. Continued State regulation and licensing of 
        the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, 
        transportation, and storage of alcoholic beverages are clearly 
        in the public interest and are critical to promoting 
        responsible consumption, preventing illegal access to alcohol 
        by persons under 21 years of age from commercial and non-
        commercial sources, maintaining industry integrity and an 
        orderly marketplace, and furthering effective State tax 
        collection.
            ``(8) Section 158 of title 23, United States Code (commonly 
        known as the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984) has 
        been a remarkably effective public health and safety policy, as 
        evidenced by the fact that the percentage of 12th graders who 
        have drunk alcohol in the past month has fallen by one-third 
        since the enactment of such law.
            ``(9) The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 has 
        been significantly effective in reducing drinking and driving 
        traffic fatalities, as the National Highway Traffic Safety 
        Administration estimates that the law has saved over 28,000 
        lives since 1975.
            ``(10) Community awareness, support, and mobilization 
        provide an important context for the effective enforcement of 
        the age-21 minimum drinking law.
    ``(c) Interagency Coordinating Committee; Annual Report on State 
Underage Drinking Prevention and Enforcement Activities.--
            ``(1) Interagency coordinating committee on the prevention 
        of underage drinking.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary, in collaboration

                operating in 2004, focusing on underage drinking 
                (referred to in this subsection as the `Committee').
                    ``(B) Other agencies.--The officials referred to in

                    ``(C) Chair.--The Secretary of Health and Human
