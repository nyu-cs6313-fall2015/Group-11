                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                            December 3, 2014

  Mr. Paul introduced the following joint resolution; which was read 
        twice and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations

                            JOINT RESOLUTION


 
    To declare that a state of war exists between the organization 
  referring to itself as the Islamic State and the Government and the 
 people of the United States, and to make provisions to prosecute the 
                                 same.

Whereas article I, section 8, of the United States Constitution provides, ``The 
        Congress shall have the Power to . . . declare war'';
Whereas President George Washington, who presided over the Constitutional 
        Convention, lectured: ``The Constitution vests the power of declaring 
        war with Congress. Therefore no offensive expedition of importance can 
        be undertaken until after they have deliberated upon the subject, and 
        authorized such a measure.'';
Whereas James Madison, father of the Constitution, elaborated in a letter to 
        Thomas Jefferson: ``The constitution supposes, what the History of all 
        Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most 
        interested in war, and most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied 
        care vested the question of war in the Legislature.'';
Whereas James Madison wrote in his Letters of Helvidius: ``In this case, the 
        constitution has decided what shall not be deemed an executive 
        authority; though it may not have clearly decided in every case what 
        shall be so deemed. The declaring of war is expressly made a legislative 
        function.'';
Whereas the organization referring to itself as the Islamic State has declared 
        war on the United States and its allies; and
Whereas the Islamic State presents a clear and present danger to United States 
        diplomatic facilities in the region, including our embassy in Baghdad, 
        Iraq, and consulate in Erbil, Iraq: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

against the Organization known as the Islamic State''.
