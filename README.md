<h3>Description</h3>

truInfluence is a web based data visualization that provides a holistic view of federal campaign financing influence on the political system. Campaign funding includes monetary contributions from individuals and organizations in support of specific candidates. There exist qualitative grounds to believe that this may influence what laws are passed through Congress. However, finding trends based on quantitative data would be more effective in deciphering if the issue is real and serious enough to attempt to fix, as well as providing an interface to later measure if the solutions are effective.
